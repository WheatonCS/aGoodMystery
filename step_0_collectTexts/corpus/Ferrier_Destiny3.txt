some time elapsed ere edith could compose
her spirits sufficiently to quit the spot once the
scene so much youthful pleasure now the
silent witness broken vows and departed joys
at length though with sad and abstracted mind
she was slowly retracing her steps homewards
when her attention was roused by hearing the
horrid accents mr mdow calling loudly to
some one to draw to a side for any sake to
draw to a side looking up she perceived the
pause alarm was a woodcart which obstructed
the way and arrested the progress mr
 destiny
mdow gig some trees lay felled by the
side the road and increased the difficulty 
advancing the gig was evidently illdriven
and overloaded containing his own bulky person
and those two ladies large dimensions
 the hapless amailye prefixed to the whole
edith saw with dismay that escape was impossible
unless she had actually turned roimd and
fled which her native politeness would not permit
her to do the road was narrow and whether
from awkwardness on the part amailye
or her master the gig was in such a position
that for the cart to pass without upsetting it was
impossible
mr mdow was evidently in great agitation
at the alarming predicament in which he had
placed himself this driving is really a most
ticklish business said he with a very red iceland
my beast has not been much used to it 
and where there's ladies in the case it's really 
hem i think my best plan is to get out mrs
mdow and lead amailye past the cart just
take the reins for a moment my dear to his
destiny 
lady just sit still there will be no danger for
you once i'm out
and thereupon mr mdow descended and
taking amailye by the hair the head he
dragged her past the cart and with the sense
 safety his courage and spirits rose to their
usual pitch
 your most obedient miss malcolm i
really did not recognise you just at first this
might have been a serious rencounters for this
is an awkward turn road but as it is it has
turned out very well this is a most pleasant
meeting allow me to introduce mrs mdow
to you colin my dear this is miss malcolm
 henry whom you've often heard me mention
mutual bows were course exchanged
 and this is miss violet muckle my wife's
youngest sister we are but just come off our
marriage tower which was a most delightful
one we were most fortunate in weather 
scarcely a drop rain the whole time we
spent some days in edinburgh it's really a most
superb city mrs mdow was much pleased
with it but i regretted that i hadn't thought 
 destiny
procuring letters to some the principal literary
characters there mrs mdow has rather a turn
that way and miss violet we allege is half a
blue stocking the edinburgh ladies it is said
are all rather blue then in a tone vulgar
sympathy protruding hia fexe as near to edith
as possible he was beginning i was much
amazed and concerned to hear
when shrinking back she said excuse me
i fear i am rather late and she attempted to
pass on
o i don't think it can be late but mrs
m'dow's my regulator now hoch ho 
mrs m'dow here displayed a highly ornamented
watch and seals which hung at her side
and proclaimed the hour
ay were come on very well considering
only considering though mrs mdow for i
don't travel just so briskly now as i used to do
in my bachelor days snow that i'm tangled with
a wife hoch ho ho 
you must always have your joke mr
mdow said the lady with a laugh and a toss
 the head
destiny 
mr m'dow having now taken a safe position
went on i was desirous taking the earliest
opportunity waiting upon my excellent patron
i considered it a proper mark respect
both to him and myself considering the many
years we have lived upon such pleasant friendly
terms and i was likewise anxious to make mrs
mdow and you known to each other miss
malcolm as i flatter myself it will be a mutual
advantage you must often find yourself lonesome
enough at glenroy it's a great comfort
for a lady taste and refinement to have a
suitable companion her own sex at hand
edith tried to articulate something but in
vain she could only bow in silence
mr mdow proceeded i was vastly happy
to find my excellent friend glenroy so well and
hearty i had a long chat with him and i was
amazingly relieved to hear from him that there
was no truth in certain evil reports that some
illdisposed wretches had been spreading on a
very delicate subject it's really most shameful
in a louder key i only wish i could
find out who it was i would not spare them 
 destiny
edith shuddered aad attempted to pass butin
vain
 isatalong time with glenroy honest man
he seemed really happy to see me but says
he mr m'dow i wish you had come half an
hour ago when i had reginald and edith here
just waiting for you they've been kept waiting
and then poor man he gave me a good down
set for having stayed away why says i i
must plead guilty so r that we extended our
tower to a much greater length than w had
thoughts at first starting but you must wait
till you've seen my apology glenroy i think
you'll admit if s a fair one hoch ho ho 
 you needn't put the blame upon me mr
mdow said his lady
well i confess i had no great objections
to play the truant for a while it's an amazing
relief for a man to get away from the duties a
laborious calling such as mine and i found a
good deal to see in edinburgh though the ladies
would not allow it was equal to glasgow

captain malcolm smiled at her shnplidty
and strove to tranquillize and enlighten her mind
a little as to the actual state things but
poor mrs macaulay was too busy with her eyes
to receive any information by her ears for the
present therefore knowledge was at one
entrance quite shut out and she went on soliloquizing

o if that silly man would but stop tffl afl
this hubbleshow's past where can the people
all come from and where can they be going to 
and to see what heartless unfeeling creatures
they are to one another not one them
shakes hands or stops or so much as looks at his

as if he were any thing more to him than the

the shops they are more than can be numbered
and yet i have not seen johnnie macauley's
name amongst them ail o this is a fearful
place and now that we're in i wish we may
ever bc able to find our way out
and so mrs macaidey went on as the 

rage slowly proceeded though the crowded
mazes the city till at length it turned into 
quiet but still answer street which conducted
to their destination this was a snudl dingy
cour surrounded on three sides with dark redbrick
houses the windows ucea with white and
most them decorated with pots london
pride and wallflower in the middle the
court was a bunch for it had not the dignity 
a clump poplars enclosed in an elaborate

all looked gloomy and arles yet all bore
an appearance the most scrupulous neatness
and cleanliness even in the midst london
smoke the court itself was in the shade 
evening but the upper windows were glittering
in the rays the setting sun and edith
sighed as she thought how its glories were now
resting on hereon highland hills 
aid is this the place for glenroy's dochter 
exclaimed mrs macauley in blank amazement
 deed then if s but a poor hole we've brought

not made for man so it is our duty to be satisfied
whatever beaus us 
the carriage stopt at mr riley's door which
was opened by a respectablelooking hv servant
who listened the strangers into a sold
fitthhioned hall where mr ribley was stationed
to receive his guests he was a little round
goodhumouredlooking man with nall features
florid complexion light blue eyes a flaxen
wig and a shambling gait
how d'ye dohbw d'ye dp happy to
see you expected you sooneralong past dinner

me here kitty my dears leading the ivy
to a parlour here are mr and mrs and mia
yonriniece and all them can give them a
nnpteakcan't you kitty my dear 
mrs bibley to whom this was addressed was
seated in a small dull tidy oldcushioned parlour
before a lite worktable with a large ominouslooking
bag attached to it she was in outward
appearance a complete contrast to her husband
she was a tall and rather statelylooking per
son well made well clothed and yery upright
she had a grey complexion large roman nose
eyes such as wordsworth describes 
 two eyes not dim but a healths stare
wide sluggish blank and ignorant and strange
proclaiming boldly that they never drew
a look or motion at intelligence
altogether she was a grave and imposing
aspect she welcomed the party with formal
politeness and saluted edith with what was
meant for affectionate kindness but lacked its
genii warmth which however edith's own
 fiestiny
emotion mr ribleys flurried movement and
die usual bustle arrival rendered less observable

 kitty my dear sure miss your niece
and her friends must be hungry can't you let
them have a rumpsteak london rumpsteak 
a great delicacy to scotch people 
certainly mr ribley if you think proper
and our friends dp not object
but here with one voice the offer was declined
by the whole party
 not have a nice rumpsteak exclaimed
mr ribley in astonishment why if s quite
a restorative after a journey perhaps you prefer
tea and toast tea and toast very good
repeated he as he ambled up and down the room
kitty my dear ajji't it our teatime 
 it will be in a quarter an hour mr
ribley replied mrs ribley looking at her
watch and in the meantime 
ah in the meantime interrupted mr ribley
 shan't we order a sandwich nice ham
sandwich westphalia ham in the house at
this moment beautiful ham bought it mydestiny

self the flesh as red as a rose fat as white asa
lily quite a nosegay aiit it kitty my
dear
 a very fine ham indeed mr ridley responded
mrs ribley but here another protest
was entered against the sandwiches and as the
carriage was still waiting to convey captain
malcolm and mrs macauley to their respective
destinations they declined waiting even for the
tea and toast but took leave promising to return
to dinner the following day poor mrs macauley
could not trust herself to speak to edith
but struggling to repress her feelings after s
long embrace the affectionate feature tore her
self away and edith was left to the combined
wretchedness loneliness and constraint

me and mrs ribley were in their own way
a iery respectable comfortable pair but it was
comfort and respectability from which mindof
a higher cast would have turned away and
indies there was httle to love or adore iii
eilber mr bibley was what he at first sight
appeared to be a mare gossiping good hi
short they were dull plodders through life mhi
 destiny
out any other purpose than that fulfilling
small duties and contributing to their own selfish
comforts
such was the pair with whom edith was
henceforth to be associated and already her
heart sickened at the dreary anticipations which
imagination placed before her for the first
time the misery dependence was felt by her
in all its bitterness and all the bright and lovely
pensions her early ys rose before her as if
to mock the joyless realities her present condition
oh could her father have foreseen that
such was to be the destiny the last his
mighty line that she the child wealth and
state and highbon pride was to sink into the
humble dependent the sordid and obscure
relation whom in the days prosperity he
scarcely deigned to acknowledge such were
edith's last mournful reflections ere she sunk to
sleep the tears still wet on her eyelids
true as the dial to the sun
the following morning brought the faithful mrs
macauley to the bedside her beloved charge 
destiny 
andwliea edith opened hier eyes the first object
that presented itself was the round happy
face her old friend beaming upon her with
looks love and gladness as she sat by the
bed with a nosegay in errand
 good morning to you my darling cried
she in her usual bathe tone which like herself was always 
they returned home at the diasodr
hour captain malcolm and mrs macauley arrived
and were received by mrs ribley in a
tafige dull stiff respectable drawingroom with
ilk little serpentine sofas and formal circle

up the wall its high mantelpiece decoy

great impatience was now expressed iorikib
arrival mr charles penshurst and the rate
rapid sketch his history which had been given
to edith was now repeated to captain mak

ent all her money and broke her heart t
charles my nephew must make a rich marriage
swill settle handsomely upon him if he does
 wouldn't go into the conntinghouse muflt
take either to the law or the church and so on
till in a few minutes a cabriolet drove into the
court and in a second mr penshurst was announced
edith had certainly not thought mob
about mr ribley's nephew but it is scarcely
possible to hear a person talked about without
attaching some ideas to their name and thus
identifying them in our own imagination in
mr charles penshurst the nephew mr riib
ley and the intended lover miss mogg the
muffinmaker's daughter she had expected to
behold oddity and vulgarity coinhoied iilo
 destiny
oqttuqon degree her surprise was therefore
gk at the entrance an elegantlooking
yelping man with something even aristocratic
air and address but there was scarcely time for
an introduction before the company were shun
money to the diningroom where stood a handsome
silver tureen birch's turtlenskrap in solitary
majesty 
r now exclaimed mr ribley you shall
taste nectar and ambrosia just halfaguinea
quart to think how chei now do taste it
ttpit you ever taste any thing so delicious 
aid he looked at edith as though he expected
hex to swoon with delight at the first spoonful
an seemed rather mortified at the calm manner
in which she received her initiation in this ambrosial
banquet to do mr ribley justice he
was as much a benevolent as a selfish 
 for although he enjoyed good things
himself he had no less pleasure in exciting the
admiration others at the superexcellence 
his repasts he was likewise a gourmand the
tie john bull breed and with the single except
tio birch's turtlesoup liked nothing that was
dssnnt 
not phdn no matter how costly the material
provided it were genuine english product
and mannfietetnre the same thorough english
stamp iof solid comfort and consistency pervaded
the whcde establishment all denoted unostentatious
wealth that had gone down from epithet
to son there was nothing aimed at that was not
accomplished and if that was not in the first
style elegance or ehion it seemed as if the
deficiency were not from lack means but ttf
ambition or pretension all this proceeded from
no superiority thinking or acting in mr ideed i do not doubt it for you was alwar
a gentle forgiving creature but a all that
you know we never can be sure we have forgiven
unless we are ready and willing to be
reconciled
 i am ready to be reconciled said edith
 but surely it is not my part to court the recon
citation were they in my situation and i in
theirs it would be otherwise
 o i'm sure if they were reduced to straits
any one them you would be the very first to
go and help thc and be kind and loving to
destiny 
tiber bay its because they have more 
iviorld's pelf that we think shame to let them sei
that we are not so grand and so rich as we one
were and we think that s our humility what
maybe if s nothing but pride ugly pride as the
chiltern's calls it working in our hearts
edith mused for a little while then said
 you are right dear macky it is pride that
struggles in my heart and would prevent me
from doii what i feel it is my duty to do to
wait upon my whither's widow if i could have
power to confer any thing upon her any mere
worldly gift i should not hesitate for a single
instant there would be no selfsacrifice there
but to go poor dependent and friendlessv
tears built from her eyes then throwing her
arms round her old friend's neck but not
friendless she cried while i have you to love
and counsel me in the path duty
the result was that she should that very day
wait upon lady elizabeth as the next was that
fixed fer the ribleys leaving town for the summer

accordingly at the early hour two edith
aetlouty accompanied by mr and mrs bdbley
aom case her finding access were to drop
jitotbere and proceed to take their ride in
tiiepark while she paid her visit
v tupon sending up her card she was admitted
and ushered into a small room where a hot sun
slieamed through rosecoloured curtains aad a
still hotter fire blazed as if for the benefit idf
three lapdogs who lay rolled up on cushions
before it two paroquet were scolding at ne
ide on the other sunk in aauteuily and etb
tfllfped in shawls sat her ladyship with breakfast
before her and a bullfinch pecking sugary
aslo chairs tables couches cabinets musical
instruments busts screens plants flowers and
ijbina literally left scarcely room for the sole 
ie foot to tread its way through this labyrinth
leith however succeeded in steering her course
io the middle the room where she teas assaulted
by the three dogs
i don't be afraid my dear called her 
in a weak tremulous voice as she laid her
fk to edith's they are the sweetest loves 
htkey never do bite except in played amor
binding chri have done yoa remember
ikiy darlings amoretta and bijou putting iw
handkerchief to her eyes but it is too sadi
we won't talk such things and dearest amdv
is getting delicate with a deep sigh my
darling bully don't make yourself sick i
 t ii
whi did you come to town my dear i aai
sore you i am quite happy to see you and pott
look very well every well indeed 
this was said with a tone chagrin as sh
glanced from edith's lovely serene countenance
and finelymoulded form to her own haggard
peevish ace and shrivelled madeup shape
which not even the aid an elegant dfyhabibi
tavld either adorn or disguise in answer td
edith's enquiries she replied speak louder
my dear i have got a little cold and am si
wrapped up i can't hear any things the fiiot
was she was now very deaf and somewhat bliikl
two disgraceful circumstances which should
jg have passed over yes i jive got a cold
iriiich would have prevented my singing to
tights so i thought it best to put off my party
you are more embonpoint than you used to be 
 destiny
yoa must beware that are you fond birds
these paroquet were a present from miranda
she is ia town shave you not met her yet 
were you not at lady ellington's ball last
night i have got a little cold and did not go
i fun nursing myself in hopes i shall be able
tor the duchess st leger's party tomorrow
perhaps you gyp i would offer to call for you
but the jgeut is lady mowbray is to call for mein
her carriage but another time i shall be
quite happy to take you and by the by can
i io any thing for you my milliner madame
la roque is perfect trader expensive to be
mure but one must pay for pretty things you
know i am sure florinda will be delighted todo
any thing in the world for you and will be
happy to send you a card for her ball pray
what is your address for i really would not
make it out upon your card something court
is it not where can that be my dear 
edidi blushed as she relied that she was to
leave town the following day then added i
reside in the city will relations my mother
 shocking in the city why that s too
destiny 
dreadful how could you think going to
such a place ewe must endeavour to get you
out tf it as soon as we can said her ladyships
gravely v i must consider what is to be don
for you i forget whether poor dear glenroy
left much fortune i'm afraid not thas a pity
but it can't be helped apropos i have got
such a pretty set coral for you i must desire
my maid to fetch them and she rang the bell
but before it was answered she exclaimed ah
by the by i forgot them in the hurry and the
multitudes affairs on leaving naples nevi
mind i shall get something for you here we
can do that any day now before we part
my dears continued she let me settle something
for you you are with very good sort 
people course but you know to be any
service to you while you live in th city is out
 the question and to have any success in
the world you must leave it immediately i ani
sure florinda would tell you the same thing
as for sir reginald here she shrugged her
shoulders then in a low tone whispered let
me tell you my dear you had an escape from
vol iii e
 destiny
that man most unfortunately for my poor dear
florinda in fact it was quite a mesalliance
for her but she quite sacrificed herself to the
romantic goodness her heart she thought
it necessary to fall in love with him because he
had saved her from being drowned but as i
said to her why if your footman had saved you
from drowning would you have thought it necessary
to marry him but however we shall not
talk that at present ewe must think what
can be done to save you my house as you see
is very small and i require a great deal accommodation
 but perhaps i might eyes i rather
think i could manage to have a room for you
during the few weeks i shall remain in town 
and then
here edith with thanks begged leave to
decline the honour intended assuring her that
she was satisfied to remain in her present situation
 that it was one she had voluntarily chosen
for a time and therefore it would be using mr
and mrs ribley very ill were she to quit their
house merely because their station in life was
not sufficiently elevated
destiny 
why you ought never to have gone to such
a place certainly my permission ought to have
been asked before you involved yourself in a
manner which may put it quite out my
power to bring you forward how can i possibly
be any service to you after you have
spent six weeks in such society how could i
possibly introduce you with any effect scotland
and scotch people and scotch books and
scenery and so forth happen to be in fashion
at present and i could present you perfectly
well as just arrived from scotland and as at
present there is rather a want any thing very
distinguish amongst the dsmtantes the season
florinda unhappily being out the field
with your face and figure both i must say
astonishingly improved i have no doubt you
would cause a sensation and get very well married
before the the season but if you
remain where you are i can positively do nothing
for you
here mr ribley's carriage was announced
and edith could only repeat what she had before
said as she hastened to take leave
 destiny
wed i shall tiny what can be done and
whether florinda can send you a card for her
ball but where in the world will it find you 
i should be sorry that lady waldegrave
took so unnecessary a trouble replied edith
since i could not even if i would avail myself
 it i leave town tomorrow with mr and
mrs ribley
her ladyship here began to remonstrate still
more vehemently on the impropriety her
remaining where she was but edith was firm
in her resolution to remain where she had voluntarily
placed herself and indeed the inducement
held out by lady elizabeth was sufficient
in itself to make her recoil from her proposal
edith was too ignorant the little mean
crooked ways the world to discern aught but
mere weak mistaken kindness in her stepmother's
anxiety to have her thus brought forward
but the fact was her ladyship had her own ends
to answer in this fair seeming show she had
fallen very much into the sear and yellow
leaf fashionable notoriety her parties were
ill attended she was not invited to those she
destiny 
wished most to be at and when she went into
public she found herself slighted and neglected
in short her life was one constant scene petty
mortifications and insignificant attempts to regain
her place in society a place long since
filed up by others who in their turn would be
pushed aside when their little day was passed
she had however enough worldly craft to be
atvare that she might rise into consequence if
she could introduce any thing to cause a sensation
in the gay world she had indeed a recent
example before her eyes in the wonderful success
which had attended a declining dowager's
introduction a handsome niece and the first
sight edith immediately suggested to her
what great eat she might attain by becoming
the patroness one young beautiful and a
novelty one whose birth would not disgrace
her and whose native grace and elegance would
stand the scrutiny even the illnatured wellbred
world
 destiny 
chapter x
the time had now come when edith was to
part from her kind friend captain malcolm she
knew not for how long he was to set out for
inch orran the same day that she was to leave
london
stinir
english village how different from the nature
 a highland chief's mountain solitudes 
i mr ribley's villa the grove so called from
a little patch poplars and portugal laurels at
the back the house was in one the many
pretty villages with which the environs london
abound it stood at the and a little
apart from a row houses in front which
was a broad gravel walk garnished with a row
 poplars and dignified by the appellation 
the mall before this stretched a fine expanse
o common interspersed with other rows and
crescents as well as with detached and more
moral dwellings some embowered in their own
little grove or tiny park and pleasureground
others with their simple paddock and little walled
garden while a still humbler class boasted only
 a flowerplat and a single tree stately
growth shading their thatched roof and latticed
window
mrs ribley had frequently alluded to the plan
 life that was to be pursued when they should
be settled in the country as something that was
to be no less edifying than delightful and
destiny 
though edith's expectations were certainly not
sanguine as to the pleasure she was to experience
from being associated in anyway with her aunt
still she was not prepared for any thing so intolerable
as the mode life she found chalked out
for her to sit in the parlour all the morning
with this inane pair mrs ribley hemming frills
for mr ribley's shirts while he gabbled nonsense
or by his lady's desire read aloud some edifying
and instructive work her own selection todo
poor mr ribley justice he would have resisted
the task if he had ever been in the way 
resisting any kitty my dear's commands bib
all that he had energy for was to try every shift
to avoid it tien to play over on an indifferent
instrument mrs ribley's old sonatas and sing
her antiquated airs to pay and receive visitstake
an airing thus was the morning consumed
while the evening was devoted to walking backwards
and forwards on the mall chatting and
gossiping with dull idlers like themselves the
only relief to this life monotony was that mr
fenshurst generally drove out to dinner and
contrived to secure edith's arm for the evening

 destiny
walk mr and mrs bibley expressed their surprise
to each other at the frequency and length
 their nephew's visits but mr bibley always
settled the point by summing up his animadversions
with ah charles knows what he's
about looking after the elegant and accomplished
miss mogg three hundred thousand
pound and old mogg in a dropsy 
nothing could be more methodical than mrs
bibley she had her days her hours her months
her minutes marked out each and all for their
own especial purpose and these purposes the
most dull and insignificant imaginable twere
greatly wise says young to talk with our past
hours and ask them what report they bear to
heaven but meagre and unsatisfactory would
have been the register mrs bibley's doings
even on earth hers were the doings a dull
worldly mind operating in the narrow sphere 
earthly duties and affixing undue importance to
the most trivial affairs life and perhaps 
all the varieties character there are few more
insupportable as a companion than a dull serious
trifler even mr bibley's silly vulgar loquacity
destiny 
twas less irksome than the leaden reiteration
 his lady
it was mr bibley's regular practice every
morning after breakfast to take his station at
the parlour window to spy all that could be
spied and to communicate the knowledge so
acquired to kitty my dear as she sat at her
work not that he confined himself to that particular
time for taking his observations for he
was one those restless fidgety bodies who
never can be still and his head was to be seen
poking out at the window or peering over the
venetianblinds all the hours the day but
that was a favourite hour with him as the one in
which the various tradespeople were with true
english punctuality making the rounds the
village to supply their customers with provisions
for the day this was a high treat to mr ribley
and thus was he wont to impart his information
to his lady 
kitty my dear here's the butcher's boy

thousand pound having white meat whitefish

if their soup was white too 
 indeed i shouldn't wonder mr ribley
some people are so very odd 
much more the same colloquy went on
till the forms the butcher fishmonger poulterer
boys faded into distance or vanished
abruptly from the view

chapter xl
as the mind commonly finds its own level in
society it may be inferred that mr and mrs
bibley's circle acquaintances was composed
 commonplace vulgarminded persons like
themselves full the paltry gossip and petty
detail the narrow sphere in which they moved
cards had been exchanged with miss mogg but
no introduction had yet taken place occasional
glimpses however had been caught her by mr
ribley as she walked accompanied by the lady
who lived with her as her chaperon or as she
was to be seen sometimes driving out with
old mogg in a very handsome carriage with
richly liveried attendants
amongst the little coterie the mall and its
neighbourhood there was a constant interchange
 teadrinkings or still worse what they called
bestint 
evening parties including cards cake music
lemonade and ennui it was at one these
that'the elegant and accomplished missmogg
made her first appearance and edith was again
surprised to behold in the person the muffinmaker's
daughter a very pretty fashionablelooking
girl who talked laughed played and
sung in a very welltaught manner in short
miss mogg was like thousands other pretty
girls who have been educated at fashionable
boardingschools and acquired that external polish
which is now the great aim and education
to impart edith had not mixed much
in general society but she had been all her life
accustomed to do the honours her father's
house to many a noble and distinguished guest
and to receive in return those marked and peculiar
attentions due to the fair and youthful mistress
 a noble establishment but now amidst
this plebeian coterie she found herself a person
 no consequence whatever compared to miss
mogg the muffinmaker's daughter so relative
a thing is personal importance she was slightly
and civilly sometimes compassionately spoken
 destiny
to evidently as the poor dependent niece who
lived with good mrs ribley but all was wonder
and admiration and exclamation at the
beauty the dress the accomplishments the
charming miss mogg edith felt the difference
but she had so little personal pride or vanity that
she felt it without pain except as it forced upon
her the retrospect changed days and fallen
fortunes mr penshurst who unexpectedly joined
the party was the only one who did not enter
the charmed circle which surrounded miss mogg
as she sat at the piano but took his station by
edith who sat a little apart this faux pas at
the very outset would not have been passed over
in silence by mr ribley had not he and his lady
been both at cards in the back drawingroom
and ignorant what was going on while edith
viewing him as the intended lover miss mogg
gave him credit for the delicacy which kept him
from jostling and elbowing with the crowd 
her admirers
how you must despise us mercenary english
said he to edith as he stood by her chair
and looked with something like scorn on the
destiny 
rest the company when you see the homage
we render to mere wealth 
 is it not the universal idol under some form
or other replied she
yesy with the vulgar even mere vulgar
coin commands reverence but you i am sure
would be no worshipper wealth under any
form
every country nay every heart has perhaps
its own false deity said edith
 it may be so but surely there are none so
vulgarizing as the love money when i think
 the mass wealth which even this room contains
it almost sickens me at the thought 
riches here it displays none those charms
which render it so fascinating in refined society 
and i confess the idol appears to me in all its
native deformity
 i should imagine it was seldom seen to greater
advantage than in the person miss mogg
said edith she is very pretty
yes she would look very well even at alack's
she sings well and i have no doubt
waltzes well replied he carelessly i see
 destiny
you are incredulous about the sincerity my
homage at a nobler shrine but you are right
miss mogg is a very nice girl to use the favourite
expression the caste to which i partly belong
not that i mean to affect any aristocratic
drs he added smiling or to depreciate the
excellence a body people so respectable as
that the commercial class england in it
there are many members who would do honour
to the highest rank or station just as there are
patricians by birth who would disgrace th most
plebeian extraction i only regret that you
should have been made acquainted with so unfavourable
a specimen english taste and manners

 i flatter myself said edith i am more
in the way losing prejudices than acquiring
them i have already got rid a few since
i came to england
so have i since you came to england
come let us compare notes in mrs ribley's
niece i expected to behold no i really cannot
bring myself to describe what i expected to find
destiny 
you except that it was in every thing the reverse
 what you are
that may or may not be a compliment
said edith but since you have set me such
an example candour i can do no less than
follow it as i am sure mr ribley's unseen
nephew might have rivalled mrs ribley's niece
mr penshurst laughed while he said it is
well the phantoms have destroyed each other 
let us hope they never again may revive even
in imaginations then as the card parties in
which mr and mrs ribley had been engaged
broke up and they were entering the room
he exclaimed but i must be presented to miss
mogg if i would prevent my good uncle from
exposing himself and me he then hastened
towards the spot where she was in time to save
appearances and poor mr ribley could scarcely
restrain his transports when he beheld his nephew
actually engaged in conversation with
the elegant and accomplished miss mogg
the entertainment was drawing to a close 
the company took leave and as the distance was
short and the evening fine mrs ribley walked
 destiny
home in her clogs and calash leaning on mr
ribley while edith was as usual consigned to
the care charles penshurst as they walked
along mr ribley kept repeating sweet
pretty creature is miss mogg and so affable 
all the gentlemen are in love with her an't
they kitty my dear hope she noticed you
particularly charles and you may depend
upon it old mogg's in a dropsy and she'll have
three hundred thousand point three hundred
thousand pound and old mogg in a dropsy

chapter xii
edith had felt the want her kind kindhearted
mrs macaulay and had many times
walked to the cottage where her lodgings were
taken for her to watch and if possible hasten the
progress the little alterations that were taking
place and which had been protracted from one
week to nearly three these were now completed
and she came blithe as a bee to take
possession her apartments the cottage belonged
to a respectable elderly pair well skilled
in all those little domestic comforts which
make an english cottage a perfect epitome 
simple enjoyment it was an irregular 
building with pointed gables and
latticed windows shrouded amongst honeysuckles
and jasmine and surrounded on three sides
with a garden at least coeval with itself which
 destiny
opened upon a wild secluded comer the common
sprinkled with aged thorns and gay with
furze from this diverged many a green and
bosky lane
 bowed with wild roses and the clasping woodbine
it was a happy meeting between edith and
her old friend for although no companion for
the cultivated mind and refined taste her eve
still in the simple overflowing her love and
the hilarity her temper edith found a charm
which she would vainly have sought for even in
the most polished intercourse society if as
adam smith says the greatest pleasure in life
consists in being beloved that pleasure assuredly
was edith's and her own heart seemed to
revive and expand beneath the brightening influence
 another's joy
o my darling cried she as the tears 
delight rolled down her somewhat faded cheeks
how happy i am to see you again not but
what i've seen you every night in my dreams
since we parted and was not that a great comfort
to me think you and one i ought to be
destiny 
very grateful for deed i think o for it is not
every body that has so great a gift if i may say
so vouchsafed to them oh what would hfkve
become me in the heart that great dungeon
if i had never been blessed with a sight your
sweet face 
 dear macky said edith as she returned
the fond embrace i trust you have been welland
tolerably happy even in the heart your
dungeon as you call london 
 deed i ought to be very happy for surely
i am a surprising creature to be so stout at my
great age and to have the sense granted me
too to be sensible the favour that has been
shown me for some have the strength without
the sense and some have the sense but are weak
in the body but though your good papa was
not pleased to think i had sense yet i always
thought i had my share and that i would have
to give an account that as well as my great
healthy some day
you have been very busy then doing good
as usual come tell me what you have been
about dear macky since i left you
vol iii f
 destiny
 o deed my doings have been but small
for they were all with johnnie's people poor
things two them duncan and nancy took
the settlers poor lambs and that made them
very rabbit and ill to manage especially as their
mother poor body is rather is just maybe too
good to them in the way humouring them 
which to be sure is very natural considering
what poor singinglike things they are and
archie he was sent home from the boardingschool
with the mmnps and his hand was never
out mischief but is it not very natural considering
how strict they keep poor chiltern at
they schools that they should go like tempers
when they get out them then the baby had
a sad town with its teeth and the lass that takes
care the bairns she burnt her hand and was
not able to part them when they fought wi one
another i really thought archie and duncan
would have ruggit the very heads off one another
poor things so it was a great mercy i
chanced to be in the family at the time when i
was able to help them in their straits and now
they're all set to rights again archie away back
destiny 
to the school and the baby has cut two great
teeth and the lass's hand is healed and they're
all to come down and take their dinner wi me
next saturday and that will be a fine ploy and
they will be so pleased to see how comfortable i
am this is really a bit bonny spot and a neat
house and discreet purposelike bodies that keep
it and so my we we ought to be thankful
even though we are in england for we might
have been in a worse place
edith would gladly have exchanged the senseless
soulless life and luxurious board the ribless
for the heartfelt pleasures and simple eure
she would have enjoyed with her old mend but
that might not be she resolved however to
appropriate her morning hours to her as also
such other portions the day as she could abstract
from the claims mrs ribley frequent
though formal invitations were also given to
mrs macauley to dine or drink tea at the grove 
and thus several weeks passed away without any
greater varieties than occasional parties when
miss mogg always shone forth as the star the
evening
 destiny
edith had all her life been accustomed to mix
freely in gentlemen's society and to receive a
great deal attention without attaching to it any
 those ideas love and marriage or even exclusive
admiration which young ladies are so
apt to indulge when they find themselves at all
distinguished beyond the common forms wellbred
indifference she therefore conversed
with gentlemen with the same absence design
and consequent ease deportment as she
woidd have done with companions her own
fie and there was a simple quiet refinement
in her manner equally remote from prudery as
from coquetry something this might also
have been owing to her affections having been
so exclusively engrossed by one object these
affections had been deeply wounded and though
the wound itself had long since closed it had
been succeeded by an insensibility which rendered
her alike unconscious and indifferent
to ordinary impressions not even mrs ribley
with all her cold correctness could find fault
with the manners her niece not that she admired
them they lacked that formality which
destiny 
with her was the criterion virtue and made
it difficult for her to comprehend how far there
could be purity heart and sincerity mind
and dignity behaviour without this her guardian
angel to protect the whole although she
coidd not say that edith encouraged the attentions
 charles penshurst she began to suspect
that charles penshurst was rather too particular
and unremitting in his attentions to edith
at length an sclaircissement took place one
day as the ladies sat in solemn silence at their
work mr ribley came twaddling into the room
his wig all awry his eyes goggling his hands
shaking and his whole person indicative great
mental agitation he looked for a minute or
two as if doubting the evidence his own
senses then with a sort scream burst forth
 refused miss mogg refused miss mogg 
three hundred thousand pound and old mogg
in a dropsy and he wrung his hands and
ambled up and down the room repeating the
same thing at least a dozen times to himself
pray be composed mr ribley said his
lady as she calmly threaded her needle and
 destiny
even made a knot at the her thread be
composed pray mr ribley
why kitty my dear you don't know 
why now what do you think after all such a
a fine education been at oxford and and
would have settled fifty thousand pound upon
him at once to refuse miss mogg here his
voice rose again to a treble shriek to refuse
miss mogg three hundred thousand pound
and old mogg as sure as i'm alive in a dropsy 
seen him myself legs as thick as three mine 
an't they kitty my dear 
indeed the poor old gentleman but i
have not seen mr mogg a great while mr
ribley
well all over now said he in a calmer
tone and standing still refuses to pay his
addresses to miss mogg refuses miss mogg 
and after i had sounded old mogg myself
here edith had risen to quit the room that
mrs ribley might be more at liberty to receive
the full disclosure she saw about to take place
but mrs ribley with compressed lips glassy
eyes and an emphatic waive the head said
destiny 
you will oblige me by remaining where yon
are edith till we have finished these frills it
is importance that the frills that are to be
worn together should be hemmed together
 sounded old mogg myself found him
quite agreeable told him what a fine young
man my nephew is cousin to sir charles penshurst
 only one between him and the titlesettle
fifty thousand pounds upon him myself 
and after all to refuse to pay his addresses to
miss mogg the elegant and accomplished miss
mogg three hundred thousand pound and old
mogg in a dropsy 
tis indeed very extraordinary mr ribley
that charles should be so disobedient when it's
all for his own advantage too and she cast a
look cold scrutiny at edith who sat quite
unconscious either it or the suspicions
which were now beginning to be bodied forth in
mrs ribley's dull brain can you assign no
probable motive miss malcolm said she for
this extraordinary behaviour mr penshurst 
edith looked with such innocent surprise as
might almost have sufficed to answer the 
destiny
tion none replied she except that he
does not particularly admire miss mogg i
suppose
not admire miss mogg exclaimed mr
ribley not admire three hundred thousand
pound sure he can't be such a fool eh kitty
my dear 
 i should be still more surprised if he is
capable disobeying such an uncle as you have
been to him mr ribley then turning to
edith if you know who mr penshurst does
not admire can you tell us whom he does
admire and mrs ribley fixed her large solemn
eyes full upon her etc as she put the
interrogation
the truth for the first time flashed upon
edith's mind she saw she was suspected and
with the rapidity lightning various little circumstances
which at the time she had passed
carelessly by now darted into her mind as if to
bring conviction home to her with a deepened
colour she said i have never been honoured
with mr penshursf s confidence i beg i may
therefore be spared any farther discussion on a
destiny 
subject in which i never can be interested otherwise
than as the friend the parties
then calmly laying aside her work she rose
and left the room mr riblejr's pathetic exclamations
resounding in her ear as she closed the
door
desirous avoiding being again called to
a discussion which delicacy forbade that she
should ever have been made acquainted with
she resolved to go and pass the day with mrs
macauley and thus be out the way this
unpleasant family altercation leaving a message
therefore with the servant to say where
she had gone she set out on her walk alone
contrary to mrs ribley's disapproval young
ladies walking by themselves she had gone
but a little way from the house when she found
herself overtaken and joined by the very person
she most wished to avoid mr penshurst he
offered her his arm as usual which for the first
time she hesitated to accept and with some
embarrassment added that as she was going to
spend the day with her friend she begged she
might not interfere with his arrangements
f
 destiny
 is there no other reason for your declining
my attendance he enquired looking earnestly
at her
edith was silent for truth forbade her to say
there was not and to acknowledge there was
would have been to lead to an explanation she
wished to avoid
but her companion seemed to penetrate her
motive for he said i see how it is you are
aware what has passed between my good
uncle and me and you are afraid to give countenance
to the rebellious nephew
i certainly wish to avoid doing any thing
that might be construed into disrespect mr
and mrs ribley replied edith
 but i flatter myself soit do not carry your
respect for their prejudices beyond your wishes
for my happiness 
i would hope that both might be combined
replied edith
impossible in the present case and if i
believed you sincere or at least that you were
aware the nature the hope you have just
expressed suffer me to say it would give me
incalculable pain
destiny 
 the wish toes sincere said edith gently 
 the pain was unintentional
you wish then said mr penshurst warmly
 that i should sacrifice myself for gold
that i should join the mean herd who are paying
court to the muffinmaker's daughter that j
should suffer my wellmeaning but misjudging
uncle to set about negotiating for my future
happiness just as he would for a transfer his
bankstock is this what you wish no i am
sure it cannot be
i have certainly no wish to give even an
opinion in a matter which pardon me for saying
ought to be confined entirely to the parties
themselves mr penshurst
 pardon me i acknowledge i have taken a
liberty in intruding myself and my concerns on
your attention but i had flattered myself that
neither were so entirely insignificant as to be
wholly beneath your notice
my notice can be no value said edith
 for it can render you no service i possess no
influence whatever with either mr or mrs ribley

 destiny
and if you did interrupted he i trust
it would not be used in such a cause for it is
too absurd a one to require serious interference 
and i certainly never should have even alluded
to it had i not already experienced the bad
effects my uncle's imprudence in the distance
 your manner towards me
he paused and edith made no reply for in
truth she knew not what to say mr penshurst
resumed your silence is a tacit acknowledgment
that it is so and i can easily conjecture
what has occasioned the change but however
i may admire and respect the delicacy which
prompts it i cannot but deplore that any thing
should have occurred to interrupt the happy
intercourse i have hitherto enjoyed with you
when you are reconciled to your imcle
said edith gently the interruption will cease
and every thing will return to its former friendly
footing
no that can never be it is only by mutually
understanding each other that confidence
can ever be restored forgive me therefore if i
am led to explain myself sooner than i should
destiny miss
otherwise have ventured to do in avowing that
even had no other obstacle existed the sentiments
i entertain for you would have formed
an insuperable bar to my complying with my
uncle's wishes
edith was not overwhelmed by this declaration
for her heart was untouched by it but
slightly colouring after a moment's pause she
said gratifying as your preference might be
to another i can only regret that it should have
been bestowed upon me my esteem and friendship
are yours as i trusted yours had been mine 
but beyond these i can make no return
but you will suffer me to hope you will
when the obstacles which appear to stand in
the way at present are removed as i pledge
myself they shall be in a very short time my
uncle loves me too much and is too easy in his
temper to hold out against my resolution and
even mrs ribley to do her justice acts too
much upon principle to render her influence
dangerous the provision allotted for me even
in my uncle's lifetime is amply sufficient to
enable me to take that station in society which
 destiny
my birth and fseunily entitle me to claim the
consent my uncle and if you will your
aunt once obtained i flatter myself you will at
least allow me to try the effects time and perseverance
in creating an interest for myself in
your regards
no mr penshurst said edith mournfully
but firmly i will not for one instant deceive
you i am not insensible to the advantages you
offer me i am not ungrateful for the preference
you honour me with but believe me i speak a
language that never can alter when i say i
never can be more to you than i am at this
moment your friend and wellwisher as such
let us part for the present and she held out
her hand to him as they now came in sight 
mrs macauley's cottage
mr penshurst seemed to struggle with his
emotions and mortified pride no less than
wounded feeling showed itself in his countenance
 at least a few days or even hours
might have been bestowed upon the consideration
 my claims to your regard and still i
would flatter myself that courtesy alone will
destiny 
incline you to grant them a more calm and dispassionate
consideration than you can possibly
do now a week a month a year if you will
i am content to wait your final decision
tears rose to edith's eyes while she answered
 believe me mr penshurst the measure
would only be one protracted pain to
both us my sentiments cannot now waver 
what i say today i should only repeat a year
hence my best wishes are yours may god
bless you i they had now reached the garden
gate and mrs macauley was seen joyfully hastening
to meet them
again edith extended her hand to him he
took it in silence then turned abruptly and
hastened away mrs macauley looked aftciir
him for a few minutes then shook her head with
a significant expression as she regarded edith 
 he's a fine genteel weelfared lad thought
she half aloud and as if communing with herself
 and many a one would be glad hinoi
though may be he should not look just so high
as glenroy's dochter
 destiny
chapter xii
ox returning home edith found mr ribley
still vibrating to the sound refused miss
mogg and old mogg in a dropsy if mrs
ribley's suspicions her nephew's attachment
to edith had been excited they now appeared
to be completely dispelled by a note just received
from him declaring his intention setting
out for the continent in a day or two this
was quite conclusive in her opinion that she
had been for once mistaken in her surmises and
she therefore took the first opportunity ois assuring
edith that there appeared not the slightest
ground for supposing that mr penshurst had
been at all influenced by any secret preference
in refusing to pay his addresses to miss mogg
mr ribley was too goodnatured to retain his
displeasure which indeed scarcely ever amountdestiny

ed to anger however strongly he might express
his disappointment and he therefore hastened
to town the following morning to be reconciled
to his somewhat spoiled nephew before he took
his departure edith felt the loss she had sustained
in an agreeable companion and the dull
ne and vacuity that reigned in the emily
would have been at times almost too much for
her spirit to sustain had it sought support in
outward things but she had that within which
passeth show even the ornament a meek
and quiet spirits seeking not its own in the
things this world for all those which had
once been hers she was now bereft the tenderest
ties nature d love had been
broken asunder her pride ancestry had been
abased habits almost prodigal munificence
had been exchanged for the galling yoke 
poverty and dependence even the slight solace
 pleasing social intercourse she had been obliged
to surrender a mere worldly mind would
have flown from the contemplation such disasters
 a superstitious one would have given
way to gloom and dejection but the christian
 destiny
sees in all that befalls him whether it be good
or whether it seem evil only the manifestations
 divine love as exercised in training and preparing
the soul for its approach to that perfection
which it is one day destined to realize the
value this great and allimportant truth daily
pressed itself more strongly on edith's conviction
and cast its hallowed radiance even across
the weary path she was destined to tread inconstant
communing with her dear friends at
inch orran she had always a source pure
unmingled pleasure which with the fond and
simple tokens her dear old macks affection
seemed now the only fragments that remained
to her her former happiness and these she
did not sullenly reject but rather cherished withall
the warmth a still susceptible heart
so passed the time the only varieties such
as were afforded by dull village parties and
occasional airings in the environs with mr and
mrs ribley from which she sought to extract
such amusement as could be afforded by the
objects that met their view amongst the many
closelyembowered villas which lay on every
bestint 
side there chanced to be one which more particularly
attracted edith's attention from the
beautiful disposition the grounds and the
glimpse she caught the house through the
rich and varied foliage which formed a leafy
screen all around as if in the true spirit 
english seclusion to hide the home beauties 
the scene from the vulgar eyes profane the
passerby she enquired mr ribley to whom
it belonged
sure don't you know why that is
woodlands belongs to your relation lady
waldegrave sweet pretty place and such a
fine bouse never lives there though suppose
you were to get an order from her ladyship to
go and see it and we'll make a party and ask
the claridges and the judges and mr and
mrs bodkins and miss mogg and a few friends
and have a picnic in the pleasuregrounds sure
kitty my dear that would be very pleasant 
 and this thought edith as she gazed
upon it with mournful feelings undefinable to
herself this is one florinda's many fair
 destiny
but neglected homes the contrast her
own situation homeless and dependent swelled
her heart with new and painful emotions but
such feelings were alien to her noble generous
nature and were quickly dispelled by better
thoughts she shook away the tear which had
risen to her eye and looked serenely on the
lovely though deserted spot and be it so
said she mentally all are the gifts god 
and oh may he grant that wherever her home
is it may be a virtuous and a happy one 
mr ribley continued to talk the projected
pionic till they returned home and edith had
some difficulty in evading his request that she
would make immediate application for an order
to carry it into effect but he seemed likely to
be gratified sooner than he expected for on
reaching home she found the following note
which had been delivered in her absence 
my dear edith
 i have just heard from mamma you are in
town and wish for a card to my ball i have the
destiny 
greatest pleasure in sending you one and assure
you i shall be quite delighted to see you there
i wish very much i could see you before then
in a quiet comfortable way but unfortunately
i have not a single day that is not crowded with
engagements but i trust by and by we shall
have some pleasant meetings as mamma tells me
you are going to live with some relations at
woodley common which is in the neighbourhood
 woodlands and i shall probably be
there for a month or two this summer in the
mean time i am going to send my little boy
there for change air after the hoopingcough
i have such perfect confidence in the people
who are about him that i know he will be quite
as safe as under my own eye and i shall make a
point seeing him as often as i possibly can
but i should think it very kind dearest edith
if you would go and see him occasionally it
would really be the greatest possible comfort tome
and do tell him some little stories for he
quite doats upon stories it almost breaks my
heart to part with him even at so short a distance
 tell me if you don't think him an
 destiny
angel adieu dearest dear edith i do hope
you will come to my ball and believe me ever
and ever your affectionate mend and sister
flortnda waldegrave
 waldave house sunday
pes if you do think my ball as i hope
you will pray consult my milliner madame
dual she is ruinous but her taste is perfection
and for heaven's sake beware 
mammals friend and counsellor madame la
roque i enclose a general order for your
admittance to woodlands but i must be very
exclusive against admitting the village folks
while dudley remains there
a momentary flush burned on edith's cheek
at the heartless unfeeling impertinence this
billet but it passed quickly away and was followed
by a sigh regret at the thought how ill
its selfish unfeeling levity augured for herself
and others one thing particularly struck her
was it delicacy or indifference that withheld
her from once mentioning her husband's name 
destiny 
it could scarcely be the former for true
delicacy mind lady waldegrave had shown
herself hitherto incapable and edith shuddered
to think it could be the latter she attached
so little credit to lady elizabeth's testimony
that her insinuations had produced no effect upon
her mind but this equivocal silence seemed
but too much in accordance with them should
it be so she thought how little are her outward
circumstances to be envied edith knew not
yet half the selfish egotism a fine lady it cost
her a struggle to write a reply to the note her
worldly feelings shrunk from the task but her
better and more christian principles prevailed

chapter xiv
it may be supposed that mrs macauley's artlessness
and indeed ignorant goodnature exposed
her in no common degree to the various
arts deception as practised in civilised com
unities and which are commonly found to keep
pace with the increasing refinement and luxury
 society while in london she was a prey
to every species petty imposture with which
its streets abound at least as far as her limited
means admitted her large pockets were daily
replenished with halfpence for the beggars her
room was filed with trash bought as bargains
from the fortress hawkers who beset the passengers
 all which to her surprise and mortification
turned to nought in her hands and the
authority the wise johnnie himself had been
scarcely sufficient to restrain her from turning
destiny 
his house small as it was into a house refuge
for persons no doubtful character her zeal
was good but it lacked knowledge even in
her rambles on the common or its more secluded
paths few days passed without her meeting with
some extraordinary claim upon her wonder admiration
sympathy or charity edith was therefore
too much accustomed to interesting stories
and had seen too many proofs the fiedlacy 
her good friend's judgment to feel any very
lively interest in the objects her generous but
mistaken ardour she was therefore but little
moved when mrs macauley entered her room
one morning at a very early hour and with even
more than her wonted animation and intelligence
beaming on her face i daresay you will
wonder to see me so early my dear said she
seating herself almost out breath but deed
i could not wait for your coming to me for i
have scarcely been able to sleep for thinking 
what i met with last night
dear macky that is too serious if your
adventures are to rob you your rest as well as
 your money said edith
vol iii gr
 destiny
 o not a bit i grudge my sleep any more
than the pime silver when i have it to give 
but it was my own fsiult that i did not sleep any
last night but i could not get him out my
head do as i would
 i hope you have not taken this same unknown
into your heart for large ah that is i
think it can scarcely be capacious enough to
contain all that you are inclined to open it to 
besides dear macky added she smiling you
must own i should sometimes find myself in
such strange company 
 well well but you need not be feared this
time my dear for i'll let nobody dwell there
that is any ways disagreeable to you but vm
as sure as i'm alive you would not object to
him if you but saw him however i'm not
going to say black or white about him for i
know very well that you rather misdoubt me
now to be sure i have been sometimes mistaken
as well as my neighbours and i'll not say
but what i have been a little unfortunate in my
good opinions but for all that i have my senses
still for which i am very thankful even though
destiny 
i maybe do not turn them to so much good as
some better and wiser people might do
for the first time in her life mrs macatdey
spoke to glenroy's daughter in a tone slightly
indicative pique
 dearest macky forgive me cried edida
embracing her and do not look so grave if
you would not have me dislike your new friend
for having caused me to offend my own old and
valued one
 my darling it's not in the power glenroy's
dochter to offend me and the creature's
not living that i would put into comparison with
you for your own sake i'm only a wee vexed
that i cannot get you to believe that is to understand
 or or to comprehend but deed i
do not know that i do it right myself
 no matter said edith smiling only tell
me what it is you wish me to know and i will
do my best to comprehend it but now let us
set out upon our ramble this lovely morning
and taking her old friend's arm within hers
edith and she set out most lovingly to enjoy
 destiny
t
the pure air and balmy fragrance a delightful
bummer naming
stiny
kast was not sure about it and so when he saw
me coming he thought he would just ride up to
me and ask me to direct him and then the
moment he set his eyes upon me as i told you
bidfove he was so struck with my likeness to an
old friend that he had not seen rami the time he
was a boy that as he said he quite forgot himself
 now was not that very natural 
in the true scotch style to answer one question
with another shave you still got your
watch enquired edith with a smile mrs
macauley reddened
 o not a bit that question is like yourself
now deed and i wish that your heart that
was so innocent and unsuspicious may not be
gtmg corrupted and like the rest the world
just with dwelling amongst such unclean creatures
 my watch deed then he was far more
like to give me a watch if i had wanted such a
thing than to have taken it from me i oh my
darling beware hasty judgments they iu
become us poor ignorant sinful creatures that
we are
 forgive me dearest macky but you know
it is but a minute since you introduced your
hero to me as a highwayman 
 but did not i tell you my dear that ms
nothing but a foolish fancy my own and cue
i've drought much shame ever since for if i
had not been quite stupefied with my own senseless
fright i never could have seen his face and
thought ill could come it
 yet tis but a few days since you declared
you would never trust to appearances agbobf
after the 
weu well my dear but that was quits a
different thing and no doubt there are many
fair faces that hide foul hearts just as there
are many worthy respectable illgiured people
my own good mr macauley many peo
thought was not very pretty because his being
poormarked but he was very hit to my sight
for there's no face like the face that loves us
 you say true said edith with a sigh as
she thought how few were the pieces that now
looked on her with love and gladness
well then my dear is not that one good reason
soft my being so well pleased with this young
g
 destiny
gentleman that i was telling you about not a
city but he says he is so fond my fisice for it
puts him so much in mind an old friend's 
and meed he looked at me with such sweet
earnest eyes i could not but believe him
 and so you gave him your last guinea
said edith with a smile
 o my dear but it grieves me to think you
should be grown so uncharitable in your words
when i'm sure it is not in your nature deed i
could almost find in my heart not to tell you
any more
 ah pray let me hear the conclusion your
tale or romance or whatever it may be dear
macky i am only sorry that so much goodness
should so often meet such bad returns
 but you need not vex yourself about that
this time my dear for there's nothing the
kind that will be likely to happen as you shall
hear weu says i if s very surprising that
it seems to me as if i had known you too somewhere
but i cannot for the life me say where
perhaps says he in sophie former state exists
once and therefore let us look upon this as the
destiny 
renewal old friendship which is a much better
thing than the beginning a new one don't
you think so deed and i do says i
 though i am not altogether sure about a former
state as we have no authority for it but
maybe i have seen you at glenroy castle for
i used to see so many grand and genteel people
there that i cannot remember either the feces
or the names onehalf them but just
then he stopped to sort the bridle his horse
and did not attend to what i was saying sos
after he had put it to rights he said i beg
your pardon to whom does glenroy castle
belong so i told him how it had belonged
to your family for generations and how it had
pleased providence to put it past your good
papa's family and then my heart was full 
and so i told him more maybe than i should
have done and so we went on cracking together
till we came to the door my cottage 
then i was going to wish him a good nighty
when he looked about him and said what a
sweet little dwelling you have got here how i
wish i could find just such another in this neigh
 destiny
boyhood for i want lodgings in the country
so i told him it was not my own but belonged
to a very decent couple who let part it for
lodgings and that i knew they had two rooms
at the t'other it to let well just as i
was tweaking out came mrs smith herself and
t the short and the long it is that he took
h lodgings for three months and is to enter
upon them tomorrow now what do you think
 that my dear is that like a oliver think
you 
this went so far beyond edith's worst anticipations
that she actually turned pale with fear
as she thought the evil consequences that
might ensue to her poor old friend from having
g thus involved as she had no doubt with
state artful swindler and she exclaimed how
could mrs smith be so imprudent as to take an
utter stranger into her house 
o deed mrs smith's but a narrowminded
suspicious body for she hummed and hawed
and spoke about references and securities but
i said she need not mind that for i would be
answerable for him
destiny 
o macky this is really too much cried
edith shocked at the imprudence her good
d guardian
well my dear but you should waittih
you hear me out so then mrs smith sidd
that was sufficient so then says i if ryan
please i would take the liberty to ask yobf
name my own name is macauley now in my
seventieth year well at that his face w
overcast and he hung his head for a minute or
two with a very mournful look and i saw his
colour come and go and deed i was beginning
to feel not quite so satisfied when he lifted up
his head and looked at me with his full dear
blue eyes but when i saw his fine open face i
wondered at myself for my misgiving and then
he said i am called weucome weu then
i thought very naturally that he meant malcolm
for you know the english have such a way rf
clipping every thing away to nothing so i
coidd not but cry out what a wonderful thing that
was for that surely he must be some relation 
the family though he did not know it but he
sighed and said the names were different 
 destiny
and then what i thought was very wellbred
he said he would be very glad to change the
one name for the other and was that like a
robber think you 
edith saw it was in vain to attempt to open
the eyes mrs macauley's understanding as to
the dangerous predicament she had brought herself
into by introducing a person so suspicious
a character to the family with whom she lodged
and making herself responsible for his conduct
this was the very climax her quixotism 
edith now felt the want some friend and
counsellor to whom she could apply for advice 
for dauntless as is the heart woman on great
and heroic occasions still in the coarser occurrences
 this workingday world she is ill qualified
by nature or education for taking a part 
for truly has it been said women are hopelessly
and incurably unfitted for business
edith experienced this as she vainly tried
to devise some means for extricating her old
friend from this dilemma but she could do nothing
herself and there was no one to whom
she could apply she would not expose her to
destiny 
the ribleys for they were quite incapable 
appreciating the excellence her character
and comprehending the simplicity and purity
 her motives and actions and she shrunk from
the thoughts subjecting either herself or her
poor macky to the cold inquisitorial scrutiny 
mrs ribley or the senseless loquacious tattle
 her husband the only scheme that presented
itself was to try to persuade mrs macao
ley to write to her nephew the wise johnnie
acquainting him with what had passed and requesting
 him to endeavour to find out what
description person it was she had now involved
herself with should that fail she could
only wait with patience the result this strange
suspicious adventure

chapter xv
accordingly the following monubg edith
stet forth as usual for the cottage and found ihi
ever active macky chanting away to hersei
 
what beauties does flora disclose
how sweet are her smiles upon tweed 
as she was diligently culling a nosegay the
sweetest and the fairest for her beloved erewhile
her bible and her stocking lay near heron
a rustic seat canopied with honeysueklsfiu
after the first affectionate salutations and tender
enquiries were made on both sides and edith
as was her custom had read to her old mend a
portion that whose words were as bid
to them both she began to suggest her scheme
with as much delicacy and finesse as possible 
destiny 
but she had not proceeded far before she was
interrupted
i beg your pardon my dear for interrupting
you which i know is not good breeding 
but i see very well how it is you are vexing
yourself with the thought that maybe i will be
put in prison for having been caution for that
young man mr melcombe am i not right 
 mot quite so bad as that dear macky said
edith your friends would never allow that
to come to pass i am sure
well whatever it is you may make yourself
easy for i can tell you he has paid the price
 his lodgings in advance for three months before
he entered upon them for he said he could
not expect them to take the word a stranger
and neither would he take advantage my
generous confidence in him or something like
that now i do not think that is very like a
robber oh my dear should not this be a
lesson to us to beware forming such rash and
hasty judgments one another 
edith smiled to hear mrs macauley's application
 the terms rash and hasty but she was
 destiny
in part relieved to find she was free from the
responsibility she had so thoughtlessly incurred
still she had some vague misgivings as to die
character the person with whom she had
formed this sudden and somewhat suspicious in
timaey with all mrs macauley's excellencies
she certainly was not a person to captivate a
young man at first sight neither could a stranger
who was ignorant the qualities her
heart be supposed to enter into the peculiarities
 her manners and the simplicity her conversation
even allowing that her resemblance
to an dd friend had first attracted his notice yet
that resemblance must soon have disappeared on
a more intimate recognition for it was scarcely
possible there could be two mrs macaulay in
the world yet why after all should i be so
uncharitable in my suspicions she thought 
this poor stranger whom i am so harshly condemning
may like myself be almost alone in
the world and his heart may have yearned as
my own would have done towards even the
fancied resemblance one known and beloved
in happier days while thoughts like these
destiny 
were passing through her mind mrs macanley
was doing she best she could to aid the more
ktourable change that was taking place in
edith's sentiments
 o if you were to see him my dear fm
sure you would almost think shame yourself
for ever having event him to any thing that
was bad but maybe you'll not see him at au 
for he says he wishes to live very retired though
he has some friends in the neighbourhood i
told him that i thought it would be very dull for
him to live here without he had some other company
than me for that deed my best days were
fled and i was not so merry as i had been
 no more am i says he with a sigh so
we shall suit very well in that respect and
when i am here i do not desire any better company
than your own 
again edith's suspicions returned and
does he assign no reason for the love retirement
beyond that enjoying the pleasure 
your company 
 not yet but i dare say he will tell me all
about himself by and by consider my dear
b dfistiny
lldw very short a time it is since we have been
acquainted
 i do dear macky and therefore i cannot
but wonder that your friendship should have
made such rapid progress in so short a time
 there's no accounting for these things my
dear replied her friend gravely and we
ought to be very thankful when a blessing comes
in our way and not be too curious in examining
into it and taking it to pieces to see whafs in
tt just like the children with their toys oh if
we had but the spirit truth and thankfulness
how many a pearl we might find in our daily
paths that now in our pride and unbelief we
trample under our feet but with regard to this
young gentleman his health is maybe one reason
that he wishes to be quiet for when i saw
him in daylight yesterday he looked very pale
and he told me that he was but just recovering
from an illness so he would need somebody to
take care him for he looks like one that could
not take care himself
well dear macky i shall rejoice if you
have found a real acquisition in your new friend 
destiny fi
one who will cheer you in the many lopjly
hours you must pass while i am engaged with
my aunt
 speaking that my dear i really thinkit
would maybe just as well to say nothing about
this to mr and mrs ribley for a little while
jijist till i know all about mr melcombe whl
i have no doubt will be very soon for though
they are very good people and very discreet to
joe yet i think they are not just so so 
 so credulous as you are dear macky sind
edith laughing as she embraced her in taklog
leave well i shall keep your secret for ypu
in the mean time but don't tax my forbearance
too long
several days passed and still no new disclosure
was made though mrs macauley's infatuation
for her new friend seemed daily to increase
in spite the reserve he maintained
i don't know how it is said she with a
perplexed air one day in answer to edith's
renewed remonstrances for he is any thing
but reserved quite the contrary for he tells
me seat deal that i never knew before wd
 destiny
he takes pleasure too in hearing me tell him all
that i know which to be sure is not much but
whenever i speak to him his family the cloud
comes over his open brow and he changes the
subject so i'm thinking they may be no great
things any them and it would be very ill
done in me to distress him by seeking to pry
into his private affairs
edith again felt how vain was reason or argument
when opposed to prejudice or partiality
and wisely forbore to press the matter farther
she resolved however to watch over the interests
 her old friend as zealously as she could
and upon no account to suffer herself to be led
into an acquaintance with one whom she could
not yet consider as any thing but a mere adventurer
she had little doubt but that mrs macauley
in the simplicity her heart had acquainted
him with her suspicions and either from
delicacy or conscious deception he seemed to
be equally bent upon keeping his distance although
his apartments had a separate entrance
at the other the cottage yet the window
 his sittingroom opened upon the garden
destiny 
and from the smallness the cottage and its
boundaries edith was convinced he must often
be near them it therefore required no common
care in one its inmates to preserve such
strict seclusion mrs macauley indeed represented
him as much occupied in study some
kind or another and that the only relaxations
he allowed himself were a ride on horseback
and a friendly chat with her but with all these
friendly chats however there came not that confidential
communication which his friend daily
looked for but still she kept a stout heart even
against hope deferred

chapter xvl
edith went to visit lady waldegrave's child 
and though she looked upon him with interest
it was interest free from all emotion proof sufficient
had any been required that the dreams
 her early love had completely died away
never more to return the boy was indeed a
paragon childish loveliness and already the
delicate yet majestic contour his head and
features and the grace and elegance his air
and movements indicated the child high descent
youth beauty and sweetness combined
are sure to win their way to every heart and
edith soon gained the good graces her little
relative at least as much as any one can ever
gain upon the love a very indulged and pampered
child he testified great repugnance towards
mr and mrs ribley whose awkward
destiny 
overtures he rejected with disdain from whatever
cause he might suffer it certainly to all
appearance could not be from neglect as he
was most zealously attended by a french bonne
his italian nurse and german footman all 
whom seemed sedulous to please and amuse the
little idol committed to their charge the ribless
were too fond seeing sights not to avail
themselves this opportunity seeing all that
was to be seen and edith ever willing to
gratify others even at the expense her own
feelings accepted the offer viewing the house
and grounds and thus allowed herself to be associated
with them in all the little mean prying
ways in which vulgar people delight to go about
a great house there was much to admire 
the house the purest style italian architecture
stood on a gentle eminence the velvet
lawn was studded with beds the richest and
rarest flowers and shrubs while trees stately
growth were scattered here and there till time
ground gradually sloped to the noble river which
formed its boundary all that taste and wealth
could do to embellish nature had been bestowvol

ed on this as it seemed cherished though now
deserted abode
the interior the house would have required
taste more cultivated and refined than those 
the ribleys to appreciate the entrancehall
was filled with noue specimens sculpture
the apartments were adorned with some the
finest works the italian masters and in one
appropriated entirely to ike work modem
artists there were placed two the happiest
efforts sir thomas's pencil in full lengths 
sir reginald and lady waldegrave it was buta
momentary throb surprise with edith when
she came suddenly and unexpectedly upon the
all but breathing form her breathless lover and
when it passed away she stood and looked calmly
though sadly ilion it as upon the ice one
who had injured lier but with whom she was
now at peace the servant pointed to a door
which conducted he said to lady waldegrave's
private apartments but ker ladyship had given
positive orders that they should upon no account
be shown until they were put in order for a firstrate
artist and his people were niployed in un
destimr 
packing thevarioub articles purchased by sir
reginald and her ladyship when abroad
mr ribley's curiosity in the true spirit 
cockneyism became very importunate cm hw
ing the lockedup apartments he seemed itb
think nothing what he had seen in oorapvi
son what he had not seen and he lingered behind
and even peeped through the keyhole in
hopes spying something to make a wonder oi
but in vain she could make nothing it and
he was fain to return home exclaiming ever and
anon well to be sure what can be in these
apartments should just like to know can
guess can you kitty my dear for some
days imbr bibley could talk nothing but what
he had not seen soon after her visit edith
iehred the following billet from lady wade
grave 
 dearest dear edith
 i am so much obliged to you for going to
se my daring dudley it was quite a comfort
to ite to hear you had been t woodlands and
i hcqpe die bowed ym ev tiling and gave
 destiny
yoti fruit and flowers i have a letter every day
from mademoiselle le clerc with a bulletin 
my sweetest boy but still i shall be glad if
you will continue to visit him now and then
there is another thing my dear edith which
imust beg your good offices in and i shall not
teaze you with apologies as j know you too well
to doubt your readiness to oblige you must
trow that mamma has taken it into her head
that she requires change air which indeed is
very probable as the weather is now so very hot
i wish her all things to go to the seaside or
at any rate to some distance from town i have
even offered her waldegrave abbey for the
summer as we shall not go there till very late
in the season but she persists in wishing to take
possession woodlands which would be the
most inconvenient thing in the world for me as
it is all in confusion at present with my foreign
heavy and i cannot have it put to rights till i amon
the spot myself and to get any thing done
as it ought to be done while mamma is in the
house you must be aware would be quite impose
sable besides there is not accommodation for ji
destiny 
both now what i wish you to do dear edith
is to take the trouble to find a furnished house
which you think would be suitable for her as
near to where you are as possible she is really
fond you and as she is course in the best
society it would also be an advantage to you
to be with her now i do hope you will be
able to gratify me in this and the sooner you
can accomplish it the better you would see
by the papers how illustrious and renowned sir
reginald has become upon the turf 
adieu my dear
 believe me ever your affectionate
f waldegeave
 mamma does not require a large house you
know only don't let it be vicar and citish
this commission it maybe supposed was not
 a nature for edith to undertake and she wrote
lady waldegrave briefly and coldly declining
to execute the ungracious office
in a few days however she received a billet
from lady elizabeth apprising her her arri
 bestir
hai in the neigukmirliood in a very indifferent
slate health and requesting te see her immediate
as she had much to communicate asher
ladyship's carriage accompanied the summons
edith had no excuse to offer for not
complying with it and she accordingly set off
charged by mr barley to endeavour to find out
what sort things were in the lockedup rooms
at woodlands and when he was likely to get a
sight them
she found lady elizabeth in a charming
cottage omee within a beautiful park but the
inmate this little elysium formed a sad contrast
to the loveliness that bloomed around she
looked haggard and worn out and was in one
oi her most peevish and irritable moodsof mind
the day was sultry yet she reclined with her
dogs and parrots around her by the side a
blazing fire with curtains as usual almost close
drawn
you find me excessively unwell my dear
said she in answer to edith's enquiries and
i impute much my illness to the treatment i
have received from that shocking man your
destiny 
ioiinn and from my own daughter vbut pray
ring the bell this is the time when my dogs
ought to haire their walk go darlings go
pray dawson be careful them and carry
amor when he appears fatigued there now
my sweets kissing each severally as she dismissed
them to edith's great relief yes i
have been exceeded ill used which together
with the injudicious treatment that wretch
belloni has almost killed me thank heaven
i got rid him and i have got the best and
most skilful man possible monsieur lamotte 
quite a treasure but the cruelty and ingratitude
i have experienced i do ring
quickly for i must have my drops it makes
me quite iu to think it i am so aunt 
monsieur lamotte obeyed the summons
he was a grimacing highdressed underbred
frenchman but he knew his cue and having
cajoled his patient and administered some drops
he was then allowed to depart and her ladyship
was returning to the subject when edith besought
her to refrain fnmi it since it was one
which agitated her so much but like all weak
 destiny

people she liked the excitement her own
paltry feelings and went on
 it is but too apparent that i have been very
unwell however it was merely a sort nervous
attack that any body might have and which
lamotte assures me will entirely pass away
and that in a few weeks i shall be quite myself
again but i found it impossible to be quiet in
town when one is so much recherches that 
out the question so by the advice the
medical people and indeed at florinda's earnest
entreaty i resolved to try the ejbtect change
 air and proposed to go to woodlands for a
few weeks besides liking the place itself i
was sure it would amuse me to superintend the
arrangements making there the pictures marbles
and all sorts pretty things that my daughter
purchased abroad and in short i told florinda
i should wish to go to her house for a short
time only conceive her telling me that was
impossible for that sir reginald and she were
going themselves very soon and had invited
more people than the house could hold to celebrate
their child's birthday you may believe
destiny
how excessively angry i was and we had qtdt
a sine but she cried poor dear and saidhow
it distressed her to refuse me but that in short
she dared not disobey her husband and so
because you have a bad husband you must bean
undutiful daughter said i and i told her
that she ought not to pay the least regard to the
wishes such a person that she had done him
already too much honour by marrying him 
and i even hinted that rather than submit to
such tyranny she ought to separate from him
edith was shocked at this new proof florida's
duplicity in throwing the blame her
own selfish and undutiful behaviour on her husband
and thus setting at variance those she
ought to have been most desirous uniting in
affection she therefore strove by every means
to soften the injiuy and soothe the irritated
feelings the despised yet still doting parent 
and there are few natures that are not benefited
in some degree by the bland voice sympathy
lady elizabeth's manner became less feverish
and irascible as she proceeded yes it is all
very well as it ha turned out this is a pretty
h
 destiny
tiny cottage and my dogs are quite safe in the
perk no thanks to my daughter though poor
dear it was no vlt hers either but my good
cousin lady arabia conway happened to call
at the very time when miranda and i were botha
little agitated with what had passed and so i
told her exactly how it was and she the best
creature in the world next day sent to offer
me this cottage which had been built by admiral
conway for his mother and in short me
void and though i am not particularly fond 
a cottage yet it suits me with my very limited
income to have a house without paying for it
thus she run on till the return her dogs from
their walk when edith would finn have left her
to the pleasures their society but her stepmother
was not willing to part with her so
easily for even she could feel though she could
not properly appreciate the harmonizing influence
 edith's presence that gentle forbearance
and total absence all selfish egotism
which are charms in themselves no negative
description on her part edith compassionate
the mother such as she was thus disregarded
destiny 
and cast off by her owb lier only child work
and fiiroloii as she was she trusted her mind
might yet be turned to better things and that
bad heath and disappointment might lead her
as they had dome many others to relinquish those
vanities which only served to mock and cheat her

consented to pass a week or two with her step

prior claims upon her and having promised at
all events to see her as often as she could she

in her way home she stopped at mrs maoaudley's
humble abode and upon entering her
little parlour foimd that woy with a face 
deep deliberation muslog upon the contents 
a letter she held in her hand the letter was
from the wise johnnie and the purport it was
to this effectthat mrs j macauley and he
would take it very kind if their good aunt would
retuni to them as soon as possible archie having
just been sent home from school with the modified

paltry airs fashion they sought not in its
weak beggarly elements either for happiness
or distinction but young beautiful rich and
noble they dared be wise and good cheered
and invigorated by this communion mind
and similarity tastes and pursuits edith's
spirits gradually rose to their own natural pitch 
and her eyes beamed and her cheeks glowed
with all the animation and more than all the
beauty former days for it was now beauty
matured and embellished by expanded intellect
and more exalted feelings
the time was thus passing pleasantly away
when lady waldegrave arrived to take possession
 woodlands for the remainder the
summer this event was no sooner known to
lady elizabeth for she did not even wait till
it should be communicated than she was on the
 destiny
 fidgets to go to her daughter whether for the
purpose embracing or reproaching seemed
uncertain probably both she accordingly
ordered her carriage without even consulting
dr lamotte and attended by her dogs set
out to spend the day where she had little reason
to flatter herself she would be a welcome gest
edith had declined accompanying her and
haying a general invitation to oakley house
gladly availed herself her liberty to go and
spend the day with her mends there

chapter xv iii
although the distance between oakley
house and the cottage was in reality short it
was lengthened to a considerable space by the
beautiful diversity the ground which intervened
and to which the walks and drives had
been judiciously adapted edith could not help
contrasting in her own mind as she walked
along the difference between the sylvan graces
 an english home scene such as this and the
more picturesque beauties her own highland
domain at the dear recollection glenroy
her heart flew back to the loved haunts its
early days and the thoughts the present
were all suspended while again she lived over
the past the gay visions her childhood rose
to view but they who had formed her felicity
then where were flies now ronald norman
 destiny
reginald for each and all them how many
were the bitter tears she had shed and what
had jle reaped from these fair blossoms life's
morning alas nought but regret sorrow and
disappointmentfrom
contemplations such as these she was
roused by coming suddenly in contact with admiral
conway as he advanced from an adjacent
walk leaning on the arm a gentleman with
whom he appeared to be in earnest conversation
conscious that the traces her emotion must
be visible on her countenance edith scarcely
ventured to raise her eyes still swimming in
tears and having exchanged salutations would
have passed on but this the admiral would
not permit
 come this is a fortunate encounter cried
he lady arabella has half quarrelled with
me this morning for depriving her this
gallant convoy pointing to his friend with
whom she had intended to figure off to the cottage
 but i shall make my peace handsomely if
i return with such a air prize miss malcolm
allow me to introduce mr melcombet
destiny 
edith looked up in amazement at the mention
 this name and beheld a young man noble
mien and features but so pale and with such
visible emotion on his countenance that she
could scarcely refrain from uttering an exclamation
 alarm but the next moment she smiled
to think this must be the unknown friend mrs
macauley and she at once felt she had wronged
him by her suspicions ail this was the conviction
 a moment while the admiral went
on 
 tie similarity your names is so great
that i know not how we are to distinguish them
in england where we don't give the vowels
such fair play as you do in scotland you must
teach me the true pronunciation your name
miss malcolm that i may not offend its celtic
antiquity by confounding it with our saxon
appellatives
 england has rid me some my celtic
prejudices said edith and has taught me
what i certainly might have known beforethat
there is nothing in a name beyond the association
 ideas we connect with it
vol iii i

 destiny
 and the bssociatbns replied he are
rather in fityour your none distinguished as
it has been in ancient times as iprell as in modern
days i ani therefore glad that england mean
lay daim tosto the patronymic my gallant
friend here melcombe what is the matter
are you ill
hie question brought back mcnre than the
glow health to mr welcomes ace as he
uttered hastily yes quite but 
 but you turn pale at the thoughts hearing
your panegyric proclaimed in a fair lady's
ear well depend upon it the deeds captain
melcombe would have shone ten thousand
times brighter in her eyes and sounded a thousand
times sweeter in her ears had they been
achieved by a captain come makkum 
wwdiisit
neither said edith smiling and you
must not batter yourself you will be able to
pronounce a highland aime until you have first
breathed our mountain airs
stiny 
you on the top some highland parnassus
what say you to joining me in that expedition
melcombe i suspect you would find it a more
arduous tad to haul me up to the top benlomond
than it was even to hoist the greek
flag oyer the turkish crescent 
 i trust i shall one day be allowed to make
the attempt said mr melcnbe
there was something in the tone oi the voice
full clear and melodious as it was which made
edith start and unconsciously she looked with
an enquiring gaze at the speaker again the
colour mounted almost to his brow as he met her
look an unaccountable feeling constraint
seemed to take possession hun and although
the admiral continued to talk away without
noticing the embarrassment his companion
he remained nearly silent during the rest the
walk
 now have i not made a good cruise it 
said the admiral to his lady as he presented
edith who was received as usual with open
arms wbat more could you have done had
you led the expedition yourself my lady 
 imstimr
 if i could at least hare had a little more flesh
sure even if i did not presume to claim any 
the merit it said she smiling
r i was sure that exclaimed the admiralty
nidi a triumphant air i was sure diere would
be a but or an if or an only in the casewomen
soever are contented when you marry melcombe
take my advice and marry a real genuine
discontented woman at once and then youknow
titian you are about but we never know what todo
with these laughing hyenas pointing to lady
arabella whose smile was now turned into a
laugh they are really very trying to the
temper for there's no knowing when they're in
gppd humour or in bad for my part i'm kept
a you may see in a constant state alarm
 f conscience makes cowards us all xs
it not so mr melcombe said lady arabella
gaily
again edith naturally directed her lode to
the person addressed and again she was struck
with the changing colour and embarrassed explosion
 his countenance as with a forced
noiyie he was about to reply whenl adxaj
bestir 

interposed i see how it is said he kindly
laying his hand on his shoulder the native hue
 resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast 
ihoit at the discussion we were engaged in
mod the best cure for that is to have recourse i
mr darts and compasses to settle the point so
ccrnie along to the library and taking us
friend's arm they left die room
lady arabella was silent and thoughtful for a
few minutes and then said pray may i act
whether you had any previous acquaintance with
mr melcombe 
none replied edith at least none that i
am aware though tis like a dream to me having
seen him before but when or where i cannot
tell she then recounted to lady arabella
mrs macauley's adventure and her own as it
now appeared groundless suspicion
lady arabella laughed heartily at the idea df
his eyer having been taken for a highwayman
and said he had probably been dining with
them the evening mrs macauley's rencontre
it must have been at glenroy we met said
edith musingly and i think i recollect some
 destiny
thing his air and features distich i fished to
recognise him
 that id scarcely possible said lady art
bella his is a countenance that once sean
could not be soon forgotten
edith sighed to think bow slht and transient
were the impressions the most noble and gifted
had made upon her then when there was but
one object om which her thoughts cared to
dwell
 this young maui said lady arabella is
as you may perceive a prodigious ifourite 
the admiral's and i may also add mine
besides haying been the means df saving the life
 my second son at the risk his own there
is something so prepossessing both in his count
penance and manners snethibg so sen and
ingenuous in his whole bearing that a much
slighter recommendation than edward's would
have inclined us to him hitherto we have
found him a very delightful companion but his
manner is much changed today or it may be
my fancy were you struck with any thing
peculiar 
destiny 
 i certainly wast replied edith even at
the first moment we met and now i think i
recollect when a child a lady melcombe spending
some days at glenroy and having two sons
with her probably this may be one them
 if it were so said lady arabella his
emotion poor fellow might be easily accounted
for by the circumstance his mother having
been afterwards divorced

chapter xix
lady elizabeth returned from her visit in
great good humour lady waldegrave she
said had been delighted to see her shad only
dekyed informing her her arrival tiu she had
got every thing arranged and was to have
driven over for her that very day had she
not been anticipated by her arrival to sum
up the whole florinda had presented her with
some what she called perfect gems art 
but which were in fact the mere rubbish her
collection she was so occupied in admiring
and arranging her baubles that edith learned
little more from her than that sir reginald was
not at woodlands that florinda had appeared
rather abattu but had promised to take an early
opportunity calling
 thie fouowixig dajr as edidi sat alone in the
drawingroom lady elizabeth always spending
the mornings in her own dressingnxminy a
carriage drove up and presently lady wade
gave was announced edith started up and
for a moment stood aghast at finding herself
flies suddenly confronted with her heartless
treacherous rival lady waldegrave however
ckd not appear to notice her agitation but
advanced with the most perfect ease and embracing
her laid her cheek to hers and with
her speedy modulated voice said how happy
i am to meet you again dear edith 
edith could only bow in acknowledgment
and for some moment remained in silent agitation
 but making an effort to regain her composure
she rang the bell and desired the servant
to inform lady elizabeth lady walden
arrival
 i beg pardon edith love said her ladyship
 but the visit is not to mamma but to
you i was so sorry love we could not meet
in town but it really is impossible to do as one
wishes there and by the by how much better
destine 
yon look than whenlaawyou in sootiadt xddn't
think the scotch air at all favourable to beai
you most know but you hare made a wonderful
escape from scotchmen every kind
and she sighed as she said it while shebui
reed her with the patronizing air one so
gifted in herself that she could afford to bestow
approval on another and certainly lady waldgrave's
charms had suffered no diminution for
she looked if possible more beautiful and captivating
than ever
 i came early and alone because i veasfy
wished to see you by yourself and to explain
many things which i am aware must have
appeared very strange and unaccountable to
you and which i fear have prejudiced you sacby
against me
 excuse me said edith but i cannot
now listen to any explanation the facts spoke
for themselves at the time that time has been
long since passed and with it all resentment
all regret on my part
then you do forgive whatever may have

 destiny
appeared mysterious and inexplicable in my
conduct 
 i forgave all who ever injured me said
edith mildly but emphatically as i hope to
be forgiven
 dear edith you were always kind and
generous but if i injured you heaven knows
it was unintentionally for indeed i ever loved
you and i do assure you it has many times
made me quite wretched to think the cruel
estrangement that took place between us and
her ladyship put her handkerchief to her eyes
 but for that artful designing woman madame
latour whom mamma foolishly committed me
to i am sure it never would have happened
indeed had i been at all aware that you had
the softest tendresse for your cousins

i must again repeat lady waldegrave
that this retrospection is worse than useless it
is painful
 well then dearest edith let all be forgotten
 and henceforth let us be as friends and
sisters
all is forgiven said edith with emotion
destiny 
 and in sincere heartfelt wishes for your hip
pines i am your friend more i cannot says
 then we are reconciled and you will come
and visit me indeed if you are sincere in your
wishes for my happiness you will for i cannot
possibly be happy while this estrangement lasts
say then you will come to woodlands do
dearest love 
 i cannot promise at present said edith
there is one thing i can assure you 
said lady waldegrave if you have any dislike
 any unpleasant feeling at the thoughts 
meeting another person you need have noiscru
ple on that account as he is absent
editors cheeks glowed as she said i can
have nothing to dread in meeting the husband
 lady waldegrave but do not urge me farther
at present at that moment a message
was brought from lady elizabeth desiring to
see lady waldegrave in her dressingroom
 promise me then that you remain here till
my return for i have still something to say to
you that nearly concerns my own happiness
rely you will not refuse me that a
edith promised to await her return 
r left to herself she began to reflect more
plmly on the part she had to perform that
florida should have wished to be reconciled ui
htttf and have even sought to exculpate herself
was natural but that she should have sought a
renewal intimacy with so much eamestoeu
was more than she had anticipated selfish
heartless and treacherous as she had hidirtq
appeared surely this could only proceed firobi 
good motive for in what could she po independent
as she now was benefit the gay prosperous
lady waldegrave perhaps she was
entitled to the allowance she claimed from the
weak and evil counsellors who had been time
guides her youth and if even after all she
was not happy as she feared she was notr
might she not even yet prove service to hers
and should she allow any wayward feelings 
her own to stand in the way such a duty the
result edith's deliberations was that in ap
accordance with those divine precepts by which
 professed to be guided would saoiifio
lier feeling even for those who had saefiflimil
her happiness to ihehr own 
liidy waldegrave's visit to her mother extras
not long duration when she returned flkiii
said i have just settled with mamma that ship
is to come and dine qidetiy at woodlands tomorrow
and stay all night now let me b
dearest edith that you will gratify me by accom
panyingher it will be charity to me in every
way for i do assure you nothing can be mot
iriite than i am at present you won meet 
fikml but two very charming girls lady irritant
lady maria singly and i shall be hetusi
able to open my heart to you and to ask your
advice but who is this cried die as she casta
glance towards the window then suddenly
starting up she exclaimed lady arabella
conway i the very best good dull women 
i must make my escape but who is it thai
accompanies her what a very finelooking
man i surely have seen him somewhere in
town edith named mr melcombe as she also
caught a glimpse lady arabella and him approaching
 he is very handsome find will be
 destiny
tke greatest acquisiuqii to my corps dramatis
for you must know i intend to bare private
theatricals but pray don't imreatke a syllable 
it to mamma or she will want to take a part
now pray present him to me
the entrance lady arabella and her pr
tfjfee here stopped all farther comment
after the usual enquiries had been made
and mr melcombe had been presented to juicy
waldegrave she said with all her fascinating
but artificial sweetness i fear we are not
entitled to rank mr melcombe in our wild clan 
fortunately twt himself he belongs i a vffh
civilized community
mr melcombe slightly bowed and coloured
as he replied i was not aware it was more
fortunate to have been born an english than a
scotchman since both are alike britons but
he added with a still deepening hue the sea
is the only country to which i lay claim
 what would sir reginald say to that com
pument yours lady waldegrave enquired
lady arabella
 sir reginald is already aware my sentidestiny

ments on the subject said lady waldegrave
carelessly he knows that i prefer england
to scotland in all things and only love it less
that france and italy how grave edith looks
at this declaration i do yon remember howshock
ed you were at glenroy when i ventured to
whisper that i preferred myrtle to heather i
am sure you expected some your dark brown
mountains to upon me did you not
 i hope i did not carry my cmorpatriib quite
so far said edith and she could not repress
a sigh as she added but we are naturally hurt
when we hear the objects our affection lightly
spoken by others
 especially as you know tis said the uglier
the object the more intensely and unreasonably
we love it said lady waldegrave laughing
 mere beauty certainly does not long retain
its influence on the affections said mr mel
combe
 so it has been said but i very much doubt
the truth the assertion replied lady waite
grave with a slight shade displeasure oa h
countenance v at least i have never heard any
 desmnr
gmxl reason why it should not and she 
reed herself in an opposite mirror with an tst
 haughty satisfaction
 i am no metaphysician said mr m
combe so i cannot pretend to enter int fb
subtleties the question but it is easy to coh
eeive that the influence the mind must be
much more permanent than that the senses
 constancy said lady arabella is one cit
rose good oldfashioned moral virtues which ik
no longer d la mode we rarely hear such ia
thing nowadays
 it surely does not deserve the name inconstancy
when we withdraw our affections from
an undeserving object does it edith said
lady waldegrave
edith was shocked at what she felt was implied
in these words and for a minute or two was
unable to reply when she raised her eyes
she encountered those mr melcombe fixed
upon her with an expression the deepest interest
but the serenity her countenance returned
and she replied every thing must
depend upon circumstances in some cases it
iiist lee auty to renounce a misplaced attack
ment in others to adhere to if 
 i am not such a casuist as you said lady
waldegmve carelessly for i really cannot
perceive the difference but how in the world
lm a passing remark on the respective beauties
 heath and myrtle turned into a lackadaisical
discussion on the dudes constancy i really
niustbave something to sweeten my imagination
after it prays mr melcombe have the goodness
to fetch me a bit something very fragrant
from the conservatory
 you could scarcely find one worse qualified
to execute your commands said he for my
botanical lore is almost confined to seasweed 
am so utterly ignorant i fear i may commit
me unpardonable solecism in good taste if not
in good breeding by my selection 
 well to render your offence less glaring
said jjsay arabella you shall bring something
for each and all us 
 what and so run the risk offending
three ladies instead one and am i to havi
 destiny
no reward if i diouu succeed in pleasing all or
any you 
 mr melcombe is die yery last person from
whom i should have expected mercenary stipulations
 amy sort said lady arabella but
it proves the old and homely saying to be a true
one that every man has his price may i ask
what yours is upon the present occasion 
 my reward shall be discretionary said he
with a smile and any thing given wia goodwill
will be acceptable and he stepped into
the conservatory
 that is rather an odd person said lady
waldegrave his manner plough somewhat
hruque piquant and he certainly is very handsome
and i must say distinguished looking
mermaid said to me yesterday she was sure my
ladyship would approve my new groom the
chambers for that he had fair distinguish ser
that i cannot think bestowing it upon mr
melcombe
in a few minutes he returned with a handful
 flowers
destiny 
rigs heath i wish they
had been highland heather instead foreign
head said he for then you wcmld have jmzed
them more
 but with all my national prejudice i could
not have admired them so much said she as
she took the brilliant exotics
 but you would perhaps have rewarded me
tl mstunr
better said he forcing a laugh to hide his
embarrassment
 what a reproach for my chnrlishneses said
edith as she returned him one the sprigs
but she coloured at the pleasure that beamed in
his eyes as he received the trifling gift lady
waldegrave never could endure that another
should engage attention while she was present
unaccustomed to meet with neglect on the fjf
sent occasion she mistook it for shyness and
selflove whispered to her that the handsome
unknown stranger was only dazzled by her
charms and distinction into distance and reserves
therefore in her sweetest and most winnings
manner called him to her on some frivolous pretext
and contrived to detain him in exclusive
conversation till lady arabella rose to take leave
she then said i flatter myself lady arabella
we shall meet very often wlule we are such near
neighbours and that i shall also have the pleasure
 seeing admiral conway and mr mel
combe at woodlands
mr melcombe acknowledged the compleat
by a bow and the visitors severally departed
destiny 
chapter xx
it was not without some violence to her feelings
that edith went to testify her reconciliation
with lady waldegve by visiting her in her
oim ikovme but she repressed these indications
 feelings not yet wholly subdued and calmly
meekly returned herself to the duty required
if she had admired woodlands on a first survey
it appeared to still greater advantage now when
nature and art seemed to have been taxed to
their utmost to give the last finish to its charms
and all around breathed only the refinement
 hcmry and pleasure to those who could
believe in the happiness caused by external
circumstances this would have seemed a very
paradise
lady waldegve received her guests in the
most hind caressing maimer and having provol
iii k
 destiny
vide a lively old french marquis as an escort
for lady elizabeth she consigned them to the
care each other and thus happily rid her
she directed her whole attention to edith whom
she introduced to her friends ladies harriet
and maria singly as her dear and only sister 
and she brought her child to kiss and welcome
his pretty aunt to woodlands then she must
show edith every thing herself and have her
opinion about many things and edith was led
from drawingroom to drawingroom and from
boudoirs to conservatories and aviaries and
there was so much to look at and praise and
admire that it was impossible to enjoy there
were pictures and marbles and china and
cabinets and tables and vases each and any 
which would have been a study for a day but
ivhich were yet too various and numerous to be
duly appreciated on a first survey tradespeople
were still employed in some the rooms
arranging the varied treasures art which
were designed to form one exquisite and entire
protection
 all this you may suppose has not been done
destiny 
for nothing said lady waldegrave as they
ended the hurried and imperfect examination
 she threw herself on a couch in her 
 and indeed i am abnost frightened
when i think how much it has cost then we
were so cheated at first and bought such rubbish
at such enormous prices but that is the
case with every body at first one must pay
for a knowledge the arts as well as for knowledge
 every kind and at any rate it is surely
better that money should be spent upon fine
pictures and marbles than on the turf or at the
gamingtable edith was hurt at this indirect
attack upon her husband and thought how different
must be the perception even taste in
the material from what it was in the moral world
when a wife could thus seek to excuse her own
extravagance by proclaiming her husband's
errors lady waldegrave went on but the
great work have now in hand for there is no
living in the country without occupation sis ti
pretty little theatre i have been remodelling
in fact i may say building it was originally
a pavilion or a banquetingroom or some these
s destiny
stupid senseless antiquated things which one s
ancestors deformed their grounds with i here
had it turned into sometmog both useful and
ornamental and i intend to open it on dudley's
urthnlay with a french play and ballet in wych
you dear edith will take a part don'ttay
yotl wont for you positively must but although
i have gone to work as economically as possible
and lead plans and estimates and all those sort
 things sent to me yet it has grown into something
expensive too not that i should gnidge
it at all as it will be such a source abasement
to myself and friends besides having given
employment to poor people in short it is a
tiling calculated in my opinion to do good
but in the meantime i am persecuted to death
for money by the man who undertook the thing 
although he must know that course he will be
paid yet he is for ever boring me with his bills
 but he only asks his own said edith
 poor people cannot work without litres
how are they to support themselves and their
families
 o there ate a thousand ways ineftkutng
 
mcstiktv 
that and there is nobody so poor that cannot
get credit somewhere
 but how ruinous for the poor to contract
debt if even they could 
 as to that it can be no worse for the poor
than for the rich
 it is bad for both said edith but the
poor are most to be pitied when their sufferings
are occasioned by the thoughtlessness and extravagance
 the great
 o certainly it is very wrong in people not
to pay their bills when they can do it
 can do it exclaimed edith why should
people ever have bills that they cannot pay
surely that is robbery the worst description
 why there are many things that people ina
certain station must have and if they happen
not to have the money just at the moment to
pay them where is the harm having a bill
 nones if they are sure having the money
to discharge them otherwise it is contracting
debt
 well there is no harm in that i hope
else you will think me very wicked for to tell
 sestikt
the truth i am over head and ears m ddbt
and at this moment do not know where to get
even a few guineas this was said with
erected levity and edith could only utter an
exclamation surprise and consternation
the fact is continued her ladyship speaking
with great rapidity i have been very
unfortunate first all my fortune was net
what it was said to be by several thousands
ayear then when i married here she heaved
a sigh i was quite ignorant the value 
money and course spent a great deal linens
sir reginald has never chosen to give himself
any trouble in the management our establishment
and i can't do it so we have had horrid
people who cheated us on all hands and you
may imagine how that was with three establishments
to keep up waldegrave abbey my
town residence both which bytheby i
greatly improved and entirely new furnished 
and this besides those highland places which i
am told are very expensive also to complete
the whole at the time my marriage i made an
enormous settlement upon mamma quite out 
destiny 
all pf portion to my income you will scarcely
believe that she actually draws very near three
thousand ayear from me it is much more i
do assure you than i can afford or she can hav
the slightest occasion for
 surely there must be some mistake on one
side or other said edith for lady elizabeth
complains being very much straitened in her
circumstances
 yes she is always complaining said lady
waldegrave carelessly but i assure you it i
the case with her jointure from the glenroy
estate and what i allow her besides she has
above three thousand ayear a monstrous sum
for her she certainly must either be saving
money or she is pillaged by the people about
her in a scandalous manner i ventured to hint
that to her some time ago but she was quite
angry so i have never entered on the subject
again but if the thing was placed before her
in a proper light and i know no one who could
do it so well as yourself edith love i am sure
she would see the propriety giving up at least
one thousand ayear
 stint
eculh was unable to articulate a word so
nnteh was she struck by this extraordinary 
lady waldegrave took no notice
 her silence but went on i should be
ready to make any sacrifice myself ccmsisteiit
with what i owe to my rank and statim t i
don't see how i can do it i might to be sure
part with a few servants and horses perhaps
but that would make very little difference a
few hundreds ayear more or less is really not
worth breaking up one's establishment 
 but if you were to begin it is more than
probable sir reginald would follow your example

 but it is not with me the retrenchment
ought to begin
 whether or not you might at least make
trial it
and in other words make myself wretched
and uncomfortable and give up my own innocent
gratifications that he may have more money
to squander in all sorts horrid ways besides
i am certain i only spend what i have a right
to
destiny 
 and what does sir reginald say enquired
edith fearfully
 o as to sir reginald replied lady
waldegrave contemptuously he is the last
person i should think consulting the man
who spends his life between rochford's and
newmarket you may guess is no very wise
counselled and is not likely to extricate me
from my difficulties but what is the matter 
are you ill 
 oh florinda how shocked i am at all you
tell me exclaimed edith bursting into tears 
how dreadful to be living in such a state 
wronging the poor deceiving and ruining your
husband i seeking to deprive your mother 
what is due to her neglectful what god
requires you ah florinda how can you
barter your happiness and the happiness others
for such toys as these 
 really edith you talk in a most extraordinary
manner said lady waldegrave in
great displeasure any one who heard you
would suppose i had committed every crime
under the sun instead which the sole amount
k
 destiny
 my wickedness consists simply in being rather
in want a little money that's all and as for
sir reginald he must know how i am teased
for money for we have several limes been
threatened with an execution in the house by
some those horrid people
 oh florinda forgive me if i have spoken
too severely said edith in deep emotion 
but
 o i am very forgiving said lady landgrave
coldly and very charitable too for i
really don't believe you meant the cruel things
you said and if they had been addressed to sir
reginald they would have been very applicable
the sums he has lost at play are enormous i
know that from the best authority and also that
at the last newmarket meeting he threw away
upwards thirty thousand pounds upon foolish
bets on a favourite horse so i have little to
reproach myself with in comparison that 
indeed i only do as the rest the world does 
but i m sure i have bored you to death with
my annoyances so come let us return to the

when lady waldegraye joined the paiiy
th brilliancy her appearance but little accorded
with the account her pecuniary difficulties 
and even lady elizabeth exclaimed somewhat
spitefully why florinda you dress in your
country house as though you held a court 
 you must scold mademoiselle faction then
mamma said lady waldegrave carelessly
 as i submitted myself entirely to her discretion
today dress i assure you was least in my
thoughts
in spite the flattering introduction edith
to the ladies bingley they seemed to regard
even the dear and only sister lady landgrave
with somewhat suspicious distance for
they were mere elegant automatons fearful 
committing themselves by any thing approaching
destiny fi
to familiarity with one who dressed indifferently
according to their estimation and who had never
been at d house and who course had
none the current phrases the day edith
was too meek and gentle to resent the sort 
repressed illbreeding how different from native
politeness such manners she felt only pity
for those whose minds had been thus cramped
and fettered by the bondage their own little
sphere falsely called the great world
the same magnificence pervaded every part
 the establishment every thing was perfect in
its style and yet how little enjoyment there
seemed in the midst it all lady landgrave
wore an air languor and discontent 
the two ladies lacked beaux and were dull and
vapid edith was depressed by what she had
heard as contrasted with what she saw and the
only two who seemed to enter into the pleasures
 the table were lady elizabeth and the old
marquis dubocie who ate like pigeons and
chattered like magpies
dinner was over and the dessert had beri
placed on the table when a carriage was heard
 destiny
driving round to the entrance the dog barked
the bell rang voices were heard in the hall
who is that enquired lady waldegrave
 sir reginald and mr harris my lady was
the reply
 sir reginald exclaimed she with more
 surprise than pleasure and that odious mr
harris have they dined 
 sir reginald has ordered dinner in the
library my lady
lady waldegrave coloured but said weare
obliged to him at least for sparing us a renewal
 even fribourg's ambrosial cates which
certainly would not be improved by a seasoning
 newmarket dust especially a it never is gold
dust
to edith the sensation was strange and painful
 but a few steps were between her and reginald
 reginald once the beloved the betrothed
 her heart the arbiter her destiny reginald
the faithless the forsworn the husband 
another and all the sad and solemn scenes that
had passed between them rose to her view she
shuddered and for a moment felt almost overdestiny

powered by the conflict long dormant feelings
suddenly awoke to painful consciousness
how i dislike these abrupt arrivals said
lady elizabeth in an illnatured tone they
always do flurry one's nerves i see it has the
same effect upon you my dear to edith
 if there is to be any thing a scdnje said
lady waldegrave sarcastically w had best
return to the drawingroom we shall at least
have the benefit eau de cologne and couches
there
edith felt the taunt and the colour returned
to her cheeks with a deepened glow at that
moment the little boy entered and came run
king up to his mamma
 do you know mamma that papa is come 
he cried
 yes love have you seen him 
yes mamma but i don't love him today
why so my darling 
 because he bade me go away and not teaze
him
what a kind good papa you have got dud
ley said her ladyship is he not 
 destiny
 he is very good sometimes for you know
mamma he sent me such a pretty little phaeton
from town and two poneys so small and he
dated his hand in addition 
 don't lean upon me so dudley ned her
ladyship in a tone displeasure and see
how you have dropped your grapes how tiresome
children are now go my love tis very
late time you were in bed we are going to
have coffee good night my sweetest and
with a kiss the child was dismissed as the ladies
and their old beau returned to the drawingroom
the evening passed heavily along lady elizabeth
and her marquis played at ecarte lady
waldegrave and her friends played and sung
and talked operas and turned over new
music and edith sat apart trying to read but
unable to turn her thoughts from the strange
anomalous scenes that surrounded her to the
senses all was light and beauty and fragrance
and melody but oh the evil passions the moral
degradation which lay hid beneath the specious
show her train reflections was suddenly
broken by the entrance sir reginald and his
destiny 
friend he accosted lady waldegrave whb
a careless how do you do as he merely
touched her lund and bowed slightly to the rest
 the company without observing edith whose
head rested on her hand as she still bent over
her 
pretty well replied lady waldemar
with a disdainful coolness perhaps i ought
to rise and make my best curtsy for the kind
enquiry tardy as it is
sir reginald turned on his heel and as he did
so his eye fell on edith he started and for a
moment stood transfixed to the spot then darting
forward he exclaimed edith and seizing
her hand he held it in both his and
gazed on her with looks expressive surprise
and delight but far different feelings were
edith's surprised indeed she was but still
more was she shocked at beholding the ravages
a few short years had wrought on the person 
sir reginald how different from the reginald
she had once fondly loved lit up as his countenance
was with the expression pleasure its
habitual cast had stamped its character on every
 destiny
feature all were sharpened and contracted as
by strong excitement and violent passions and
his flushed cheek haggard eyes and reckless air
told a tale from which edith turned shuddering
away but sir reginald had evidently drank
enough champagne to make him either insensible
 or indifferent to the nicer shades 
feeling he seated himself by her and continued
to gaze upon her with looks admiration
 how glad i am to see you edith said he
taking her hand and to see you here i had'nt
an idea you were even in england 
edith answered as calmly and briefly ashe
could that she had been residing for some time
with her maternal aunt
 but you have left her now i hope and are
come to us 
i at present reside with lady elizabeth
with lady elizabeth repeated reginald
contemptuously that is no home for you edith
you must remain with us you must indeed
but you look well and happy said he gazing
intently upon her you have grown handsomer
destxkv s
than ever you were i should scarcely have
known you 
there was something in the manner as well as
in the matter which offended edith's feelings
true there was still a grace and refinement in
the mien and air remote from the coarse familiarity
 vulgar life and manners but how
much moral deformity may be veiled beneath
the mask worldly refinement edith would
have risen to join the rest the party but sir
reginald would not permit her
why should you wish to leave me he said
again seizing her hand surely after so long
a separation cousins might have something to
say to each other it was not so we used to
meet ah edith surely you have not quite
lost all interest in me he spoke with a kind
 melancholy earnestness that affected edith
and she looked upon him more in sorrow than in
anger
no said she indeed i have not i feel
sincerely interested in all that concerns lady
waldegrave and your little boy
sir reginald sighed you were always an
 distant
aiel edith and i now dxn't go i
will talk to you any thing my boy you
hay you take ext interest in him there is something
then we are both interested inperhaps
tike only thing
at that moment lady waldraye called ina
sarcastic tone while she touched the harp 
 as your success on the turf is always a matter
 certainty sir reginald i am prepared to
celebrate it with an lo pesanj as soon as you
think proper to announce your victories ar
perhaps miss malcolm is to come forward as
chwrum and proclaim your triumphs
six reginald's brow contracted and bia eyes
flashed fire at this insulting speech miss
malcolm knows enough my history to know
it is one which ajsbrds no matter exultation
he said bitterly
edith felt the taunt and it raised a momentary
glow on her cheek but she only answered it
by looking calmly at lady waldegrave whose
eyes sank beneath the mild rebuke and colouring
with shame and resentment she swept her
destiny 
fingers across the harp and calling to lady har
net to join her they commenced
edith rose and drew dose to the table where
lady elizabeth sat sir reginald after standing
for a few minutes with his arms folded and
his eyes fixed upon her suddenly started from
his reverie come harris he said let us
have a game at billiards and quitting the
apartment mr harris who was lounging ever
a newspir rose and followed
eldtth was glad when the evening was ended
and only wished her visit was also brought to a
termination lady waldegrave and she pared
for the night with mutual coldness and constraint

sdb petit
chapter xxii
when the party met at a late breakfast the
following morning sir reginald's brow wore a
still deeper gloom and lady waldrave seemed
inclined to be no less peevish and sarcastic
than on the preceding evening the two ladies
maintained their chilling reserve and though
mr harris talked his conversation was addressed
to sir reginald and related solely to th
turf
edith felt the painfulness her situation for
although sir reginald's manner was less empresse
than it had been at their first meeting
yet he still singled her out as the only person to
whom he paid the slightest attention such was
the state the party when a servant entered to
say that a mr and mrs mdow begged leave
to wait upon sir reginald and lady walden

grave sir reginald repeated th name in surprise
and he looked at edith as for an explanation
but she could give none
 some sir reginald's highland friends
said lady waldegrave i can have no acquaintance
with them you had therefore better
receive your own guests in another room
any one who comes from glenroy is welcome
said sir reginald as if stung to contradict
even his own feelings show mr and mrs
mdow in
straightway preceded by the groom the
chambers entered mr and mrs mdow leading
between them their eldest born a great 
child mr mdow had evidently
been in the hands a london tailor but to
little purpose for not all the leather and prunella
 london could remodel mr m'dow
no cost seemed to have been spared in the
attiring his lady who was decked out in a
most brilliant pelisse and bonnet in the extreme
 the fashion miss mdow was arrayed in a
similar costume and like her mother was standing
out with finery
 bbtiny
 how do you do mr mdow said sit
reginald rising and shaking hands with shin
heartily as if determined to early off mafctets
boldly mrs meadow lady waldegrave
waving his hand pray sit down you are
in very good time for breakfast
 you are extremely obliging sir regime
said mr m'dow in fact this is our second
meal for we breakfasted before we set out
however i dare say we are all pretty well
appetite again but is it possible i see istfiss
malcolm here for the first time perceiving
edith i'm amazed and delighted to see you
here and stalking up to her he shook ii
vehemently by the hand this is just as it
should be and how amazingly well you look 
here is a chair for you mr mdew
called sir reginald pointing to one nextarim
self
 you are extremely polite sir reginald
then addressing lady waldegrave i need
scarcely ask how your ladyship has been since
i bad the honour seeing you at glemoy 
a slight haughty bend the head was the only
i
t
destimr 
answer vouchsafed and nothing daunted mr
mdyw resumed in a still more insinuating
manner i hope we hare not taken too great
a freedom in bringing our little missy with us 
but die can behave herself like a lady when a
chooses mrs mdow i think you had better
take off her bonnet and pelisse she'll be cooler
without them
here miss mdow was disencumbered o her
pelisse and bonnet and exhibited a coarse
blubberlipped sunburnt visage with staring
seagreen eyes a quantity rough sandy hairs
mulatto neck with merely a rim white
above the shoulders
 i think she would be better wanting her
gloves too said mr mdow anxious to display
as much as possible the beauties his offspring
the gloves were now taken off and a
pair thick mulberry paws set at liberty
 now you must not touch any thing
mysie whispered mrs m'dow as mysie prepared
to lay hands on a sere cup and saucer
 you had better send her over to me said
mr mdow and pu keep her in order
vol iii l
 destiny
she'll be very good with me mr mdow
replied the lady in a brisk provincial accent
and with a strong arm hauling up miss mysie
planted her upon her knee she then poured out
tea from her own cup for her which was sucked
in with an avidity that threatened to carry the
saucer along with it
she is very dry said mrs m'dow in a
manner as if she thought it importance
 she seems really very thirsty poor wife
said mr m'dow in a similar tone but the
day is imconmionly warm and we met a great
deal dust on the road it was an amazing
relief to enter your policy this is a most beautiful
place yours sir reginald and a most
elegant and shooters house you'll think little
 glenroy after this 
a mere cis box said sir reginald contemptuously

a cees box sir reginald it's a perfect
palace i don't know that ever i saw any thing
so shooters and there's so much taste in the
grounds and every thing in such high order
mrs m'dow was prodigiously struck with the
destiny 
grandeur the flowers and i was amazingly
diverted with our little missy's remark father
says she this is a far finer garden than
yours but there's no berrybushes isn't hoch
hoch ho altogether it's really a perfect paradise

edith's native politeness prevailed over her
feelings and seeing mrs mdow had no chance
 being noticed by the other ladies present she
addressed a few words to her and received such
answers as might be expected from a commonplace
vulgar woman full the egotism her
own concerns
 i hope we are to be favoured with a sight
 your young folks sir reginald said mr
mdow
i have only one spoilt little fellow replied
he but you shall see him and he ordered
one the servants to fetch him
 this is his walking hour said lady landgrave
with a look displeasure
only one exclaimed mr m'dow here
am i with no less than four two girls and two
boys but here comes your young gentleman
 destiny
come away sir in his most conciliating tone 
 will you shake hands with me but the
child looked doubtfully at him then will you
go and speak to that lady pointing to mrs
mdow
 no mamma does not choose me to speak to
people i don't know
ay but would you not like to kiss that
pretty little missy there 
 o no not at all mamma does not allow me
to kiss any body and i would not kiss her she
is so ugly
mr and mrs mdow both turned very red at
this insult to the charms their daughter while
lady waldegrave with a smile called you
may now go to your walk love you have done
very well
but sir reginald catching him up in his arms
said with directed anger you are a saucy
little dog and i must send you to scotland to
make a highland laird you
ljidy waldegrave shuddered and in a low
voice exclaimed heaven forbid 
tint
iiare what has been going but luckily she's
above minding those sort clashes no doubt
some them have found their way to london
by this time 
 i am quite ignorant to what you allude mr
mdow said sir reginald now heartily sick
 his guests if it is any matter business
i beg you will apply to my law agents they
understand these things much better than i do
besides i am sorry a particular engagement calls
me to town this morning mr mdow looked
very blank at this information
so you're going up to london this forenoon
 i understood you had been settled here
for the summer but however i shall not
detain you many minutes sir reginald a very
few words will let you into the whole mystery
then taking a long pinch snuff and clearing
his throat he began 
 as you sir reginald and miss malcolm
have both had opportunities judging for yourselves
 my ministry i shall not detain you by
offering any explanation my views on that
head all i shall say is this that i have acted
ilitirongliout most conscientiously and no man sit
do more
mr mdow paused as if expecting a burst
 applause to follow but sir reginald was
chafing with impatience and edith could only
sigh to hear a man boast his conscience while
it was yet in such a darkened state
 it would be well if every body's conscience
was like yours mr mdow said his lady
wannly
 it would be well if every one's conscience
were enlightened by the word god said
edith mildly
i am sure that s true said mrs mdow
taking the remark as a compliment
i can only impute the ill will with which i
have been visited as proceeding almost entirely
from ignorance said mr mdow with affected
meekness
 there's more than that mr mdow said
his lady with a toss her head
well well my dear said mr mdow ina
byway soothing manner whatever it is
l
 destiny
 tear them no ill will fm sure sir reginald
nere pulled out his watch but not to detain
you sir reginald i shall come to the point at
once the short and the long the matter is
this i find my situation by no means so pleasant
as it ought to be the neighbourhood is
sadly fallen off since the death my respected
friend glenroy it has never been the same place
to me mrs mdow will you take missy's
hands out the nellie then a mischievous
spirit has got in amongst the people they are
not satisfied with my ministry they cry out that
i don't preach the gospel and a great deal 
nonsense that kind in so much that the yery
last time i preached there were just seven people
in the church besides my own family and the
precentor
its very true said mrs mdow with in
framed cheeks but a great deal the mischief
is owing to mrs mtaig for miss mtavish
told me 
whisht whisht colly my dear ifs not
worth our while to mind what she said the
woman a perfect enthusiast but indeed they
destiny 
ere all tarred with the same stick o my lamb
you mustn't drink out the cream jug however
as i was saying sir reginald it's not pleasant
for a minister to be on such terms with his
people especially situated as we are at such a
distance from genteel society and i feel that
even more upon mrs m'dow's account than my
own fit she has always been used to a good deal
 genteel company and it's what she had a title
to expect when she married me for like yourself
sir reginald i was so fortunate as to be honoured
by being the choice a lady with a pretty
considerable independence her own and 
course she is entitled to more at my hands thea
if she had brought nothing along with her
sir reginald here rose and rang the bell
violently why is my carriage not ready 
i don't know sir
 then enquire and desire it to be brought
immediately
well sir reginald since you're in a hurry
i'll not detain you many minutes you understand
how matters are situated between me and
my people and you may conceive how little
 destiny
t bear aem no ill will fm sure sir reginald
tere pulled out his watch but not to detab
you sir reginald i shall come to the point at
once the short and the long the matter is
this i find my situation by no means so plea
sjeuit as it ought to be the neighbourhood is
sadly fallen off since the death my respected
friend glenroy it has never been the same place

i'll not detain you many minutes you understand

carriage i must wish you good jnomii
then with a slight bow he quitted the room but
turned back and taking edith's hand sais i
hope i shall find you here when i return
eth merely bowed and in another instant h
was gone
 sir reginald is very much altered said
dx mdow after a long and rather solemn
pause he's not uke the same person i
doubt he leads a hard life and it's said he's overhead
and ears in debt already in fact if it had
not been for your friend captain malcolm who
bought some the finest wood at glenroy i
believe there would not have been a stick standing

but the poor people exclaimed edith
mournfully what will become them 
 indeed they're going to the mischief as hist
fuse they can said mr m'dow what with
wild doctrines absentees and whisky there's
no dealing with them
 yet i hear good accounts mr stuart's
people from inch orran said edith that they
e sober peaceful and industrious
destiny 
 there was outcry enough about the improvements
there i can tell you when they were
first set going said mr mdow evasively
but however mr stewart makes himself a perfect
slave amongst his people i woud'nt lead
the life he does for three times the money
surely mr mdow said edith earnestly
 it is incumbent upon every clergyman to labour
diligently in his calling if the poor ask nothing
from you but the words eternal life and
you disregard their cry 
 o these were different times from the present
said mr mdow coolly
fm surprised to hear any body speak in that
way to mr mdow interrupted his lady warmly
 his sermons would stand the printing any
day but he's just thrown away where he i p
and mrs m'dow rose with a very angry face
 if a sore trial to one's patience said mr
mdow to be preaching to a set wretches
that will not take the pains so much as to come
and listen to what s said to them how can you
make any impression when that's the case 
by going to their houses said edith the
m dissiiry
tint a ciergymui is always gratifying even to
die worst his flock
 i don't think ifs for a minister with a young
finely his own to be going much amongst
side people said mrs mdow
 was not he a edthfial pastor who said i
am as much in god's keeping in the sick man's
chamber as my own said edith
 ay ay it's easy speaking replied mr
mdow but the truth the matter is i really
don't like to go to their houses they're a dirty
set and i have an extremely delicate stomach
edith turned away in disgust
 stand still till i fasten your pelisse said
mrs m'dow giving mysie a shake and you
must not take away that trying to wrest from
the reluctant grasp miss mysie a cup which
she had appropriated to herself and which she
set up a great roar at being forced to relinquish
 whisht dear mysie cried the fond other 
 you know you must not take away that and
ifs not uke a lady in a fine new pelisse to be
crying that way such a grand pelisse too and
you've been so good till now you know i'll
destiny 
not bring you back again my dawtie if yoti
greet that way the fact is i believe she's wearied
poor bit wife so perhaps we had as
well be moving
edith was too much shocked and disgusted to
ask them to prolong their visit she sighed in
bitterness heart as she thought the widespreading
evil even one worldlyminded and
remiss clergyman and the awful responsibility
those incur who appoint such to be the minister
 god 
 you'll make our apologies to her ladyship
said mr mdow and i shall write my views
more at large to sir reginald it was unfortunate
that he should happen to have been engaged
as the fact is mrs mdow and i had made
up our minds to spend the day here but i've no
doubt he'll think better on the subject when he
gives it a fair consideration
edith felt relieved when she saw the party
drive off in a very gay carriage hired for the
occasion
 destiny
chapter xxii
the day was now advanced and edith el
petted that when lady elizabeth should emerge
from her apartment it would be to take her
departure but instead that she received a
message requesting her to wait upon her ladyship
in her dressingroom thither she repaired
and found her in her usual little frivolous
bustle
 i sent for you my dear to say that as i
don't feel quite well this morning i think i shall
remain where i am and i have just been wri
ting a note to monsieur lamotte to desire him to
come hither i must say it was very cross in florinda
to prevent my bringing him and my poor
dear loves dogs it makes me wretched to think
how they must be pining in myabsence but i
really think the air this place suits me better
destiny d
than that the cottage to tell you the truths
i never liked a cottage his always unbecoming
and it was a mere matter convenience my
going there at all but with my poor pittance
what could i do however i am now resolved
to come to an understanding with my daughter
as i think it quite shameful that i should be
starving on a miserable two thousand ayear
while she is living en princesse i have seen a
good deal but i have never seen any thing to
surpass the style living here and the extravagance
 the whole establishment my maid tells
me is excessive did you ever see such a house
such a table such dress such equipage all
perfect to be sure but the very perfection 
extravagance 
i fear lady waldegrave will indeed bring
herself into great difficulties said edith un
less something can be done
 something must be done said lady elizabeth
sharply it is absolutely impossible i
can live in this country upon the wretched sum
allowed me as it is i have been obliged to
contract debt which i must look to her for 
destiny
charging and then let there be a proper allowance
settled upon me i mention all this to
you my dear because i think you are the person
to manage matters between florinda and
me i have too much delicacy to enter on the
subject myself either with my daughter or her
husband
edith almost sickened at this new development
 folly and misconduct she saw the evils
were r beyond her reach and that all her
attempts to stem the torrent which was advancing
would be in vain
you must excuse me lady elizabeth
she said mildly from undertaking the office
 adjusting your difference with lady landgrave
 if i could render you any service i would
most willingly do it but i have reason to believe
lady waldegrave is not in a condition to
better your circumstances at present
 the fact is child you know nothing at all
about it said her ladyship angrily and i
must find some one else who does so i shall
remain here for some days at least during that
time i shall endeavour to come to some arrangedestiny

ment with my daughter in the meantime i
must send the carriage for my physician and
she rang the bell to give her orders
the thoughts a prolonged stay in such a
house and under such circumstances was most
painful and embarrassing to edith and only
one way appeared from which she could extricate
herself from it lady arabella conway
had repeatedly invited her to spend some time
with her and she had promised that if she could
leave lady elizabeth before the ribleys return
she would do so at any time the performance
 this promise would have been a pleasure to
her but doubly so on the present occasion she
therefore immediately made known her intentions
to lady elizabeth who seeing she was not
likely to be use to her at present gave her
assent to the proposal
lady waldegrave heard her mother's extended
visit and edith's proposed departure
with surprise and displeasure if mamma really
has a cold and will keep quietly in her room it
will be all very well said she but in a few
days when those tiresome tradespeople will have
 destiny
made an their work i expect my whole
corps dramatists and if her ladyship attempts
to join it here she gave a groan and a
shrug and then it is so cruel in you edith to
desert me at such a time when you might be
useful to me in a thousand ways in the first
place i am quite certain you could if you
would take the trouble get mamma to assume
in my present difficulties indeed if she
does not i do not know what i shall do i am
so pestered for money
and you are going to have a houseful 
company 
certainly i must have company and i
must have amusement i am already dying 
ennui
 and yet you have every thing the world
can bestow rank wealth youth beauty 
the husband your choice a lovely boy ah
florinda since you find all these insufficient
for your happiness will you not seek it in still
higher better things 
oh for heaven's sake don't begin to preach 
destiny 
or if you will pray reserve your sermon for sir
reginald who requires it much more than i do
in truth edith you know nothing the world 
d i assure you you greatly overrate my advantages
in the first place my rank is next to
nothing and but for other accompaniments i
certainly should never have attained the consequence
in society which i have done then as to
my fortune that is not half sufficient to enable
me to keep pace with the people i live among
as for the husband my choice you saw the
humour he came home in last night no by
theby you did not see it as it was all reserved
for me but i shall not enter upon that subject
at present what i wish to say is that before
you leave me i do wish you would sound mamma
a little on money matters if she would assist
me with a thousand pounds or two it would i
assure you be a relief to me at present edith
now ventured to hint to her the real state the
case with regard to lady elizabeth's finances 
but lady waldegrave heard it with an incredulous
smile
 all that only tends to confirm me in my
 destiny
belief that she is actually hoarding money said
slur and indeed it is scarcely possible it can
be otherwise for although she is for ever buying
trumpery some sort yet the things skebnysf
are such trumpery that tis impossible she cm
spend her fortune in that way
 so four from hoarding money lady fia
beth assures me she is actually in want it
said edith
 pshaw that must be absolute nonsense
said lady waldegrave impatiently however
i see you don't know mamma so you are
no hand to deal with her since you take hom
gospel all she says i must get my steward to
speak to her though these sort people are all
so stupid and tiresome i hate to have any thing
to do with them i hope you will prove a better
actress than you are an agent for i see you are
really not au fait in that department if you
are resolved to go today do pray return soon
as i wish to begin the rehearsals and apropos
do secure that handsome mr melcnbe for me
i shall invite him as soon as the house is ready
pray tell him all this and but here the
destiny 
but here the entrance visitors interrupted
her ladyship before edith could reply the
party consisted some fashionable and 
course favourite young men from town and
were hailed with delight by lady waldegrave
who was again all animation and seeming happiness
the ladies bingley made their appearance
and for the first time showed signs 
animation
in a little while lady arabella conway was
announced she had received edith's note as
she was stepping into her carriage and had
immediately driven to woodlands as she said
to carry off her prize edith was too sincere to
attempt to return in kind the expressions 
regret lady waldegrave then thought proper
to utter at losing her and she almost recoiled
from the tender embrace that was bestowed
upon her at parting it was not tiu she found
herself within the precincts oakley house
that her spirits revived and she felt that she
breathed a purer better atmosphere

chapter xxiv
admiral conway and mr melcombe were
walking before the house and a groom was in
attendance with a led horse
 so you have left all the gaieties woodlands
to come and rusticate with us said the
admiral as he welcomed edith with all a sailor's
cordiality after that i forbid any man woman
cmd or animal to quit my dominions
while miss malcolm remains we must all make
common cause to show our sense the compliment
she has paid us parker to thegroom
 mr welcomes horse may be turned out to
grass for he won't require it for six weeks at
least
 there is no disputing such commands said
mr melcombe with a smile so addressing
the servant i shall not want my horse today
 no nor tomorrow neither said the addestiny

moral then turning to edith here have i
been urging this gentleman to remain a week
or two with us quietly here to no purpose but
no sooner does a fair lady appear than he knocks
under at once you see your influence so make
a good use it it will be all the stronger for
being exercised as my arabella knows said he
patting his lady on the shoulder with an air 
goodhumoured raillery
 my influence must be so very small said
edith that i suspect it can only serve as a
sort caf spaw for your own power
 what an invidious insinuation exclaimed
the admiral i appeal to you melcbe if
such is the case 
 not on the present occasion said mr melcombe
 and he coloured as he said it as though
he meant more than he expressed
 that is spoken like an honest man said
the admiral but indeed let women say as
they will we are upon the whole much more
open and avowed in all our proceedings than
they are don't you agree with me melcombe

 destiny
mr melcombe was silent for a few moments
as if struggling with his emotion then in an
agitated voice replied not in my own case 
then as if he had said too much he turned
abruptly round and walked away
a pause ensued which lady arabella was the
first to break much as i admire both mr
melcombe's character and manners said she
 i confess there is a mystery about him that
to say the least it is not pleasant
there is no mystery about his character
said the admiral that is well known and i'll
venture to say a braver and a better man does
not exist there are only two things i wish
respecting him the one is that he belonged to
the british navy the other that i had a spare
daughter to bestow upon him
 there is something so open so noble i
may say in his countenance and air that seems
quite inconsistent with concealment and yet
he sedulously shuns all allusion not oily to his
family but even to his birthplace or connexions
 any kind said lady arabella
in short you have just the besetting sin 
destiny 
your sex bell not satisfied with all you have
heard from good authority this young man's
character and conduct you must have the history
 his parents his mother's maiden name 
course with a certificate his birth and baptism
what the plague does it signify in what
parish such a man was born
 i have never been able to discover even to
what country he belongs continued lady arabella
 his name is english but his accent and
pronunciation though good are not perfectly
english in short miss malcolm said she
smiling take an old woman's advice and don't
fall in love with him till you know more about
him
 i shall certainly follow your advice replied
edith in the same tone
 and if i were a bonnie lass said the admiral
 and such a noble fellow came to court
me i should at once give him my hand and say
if i could not sing
o yes i will follow i will sal the world over
nor think my home when i look at my lover 
q destiny
lady arabella and edith laughed at the admiral's
romantic ardour in his friend's cause
 but i can tell you whats said the admiral
 you need not trouble your heads about
mr melcombe's heart for on my rallying
him on that point today he acknowledged tome
that his affections were engaged to one
whom he had loved from childhood there's
constancy for you 
edith felt a little piqued at the admiral's
supposing the state mr melcombe's affections
could be any consequence to her and
after a little more chat they separated to dress
for dinner the dinner party was increased
by the arrival some chance visitors but
mr melcombe contrived to place himself beside
edith at table and in spite all her resolutions
her reserve gave way and she found
herself insensibly talking to him mrs macauley
glenroy and inchorgan as she would
have done to an old friend in reply to a question
 edith's he acknowledged having been in
the highlands when a boy but he evinced so
much emotion at the interrogation that she was

destiny 
sorry she had put it and immediately changed
the conversation
certainly some painful mystery attaches to
this young man she thought i wish i knew
what it is for he seems very amiable and at
times looks very melancholy
s isstimt
chapter xxv
there is no surer mark a selfish character
than that shrinking from the truth even in
its gentlest mildest form it comes an abhorred
apparition to those who sunk in their own silken
dreams would keep their eyes closed against all
the convictions unpleasing reality so it was
with those whom edith had tenderly sought to
awaken to the knowledge the simplest and
most obvious even worldly truths each disliked
even the little she had done although they
were too much disunited to agree even on that
point or indeed to be aware what had passed
on either side edith was however no sufferer
by the disgrace into which she had fidlen as she
was allowed to remain for some days in uninterrupted
tranquillity and seldom did days pass
away more pleasantly each brought its round
 religious duties benevolent actions 
tranquil pleasures and rations enjoyments
when there was no company mr melcombe
commonly read for an hour or two in the
morning and he possessed all the requisites for
that most rare all accomplishments having a
fine voice a correct ear quick perceptions good
taste and perfect simplicity a discussion one
day arose as to the choice a from among
those which lay scattered on the library table
lady arabella proposed the life howard the
philanthropist the admiral wished to hear the
memoirs pepys for said he the one
will send us all to prison the other will take m
to court and the admiralty there we shall surest
ly find ourselves in better company what say
yovlf miss malcolm 
 i am rather inclined to go to prison with
howard than to court with pepys replied
edith
 let us try both and see whether the philanthropist
or the courtier has the best it said
mr melcombe and he read a few passages from
each alternately
m 
 stint
extracts from the diary s pepys and from
the journal o howard the philanthropists
pepys
 this morning i put on my best blade cloth
suit trimmed with scarlet ribbon very neat with
my cloak lined with velvet and a new beaver
which altogether is very noble
howard
 let it be my earnest enquiry how i shall
best serve god in the station which he hasussigi
ed me
pepys
 thus i have ended this month with the
greatest joy that ever i did any in my life because
i have spente greatest part it with
abundance joy and honour and pleasant journeys
and brave entertainments and without cost
 money thus we this month as i said
after the greatest glut content that ever i had 
only under some difficulty because the plague
which grows mighty upon us the last week
being about or dead the plague
howard
 ease affluence and honours are tempts
destiny 
tons which the world holds out but remember
the fashion this world passeth away on the
other hand fatigue poverty suffering and dangers
with an approving conscience oh god 
my heart is fixed trusting on thee my god 
oh glorious words i there is a treasure in comparison
 which all things in this world are across
pepys
lord's day up and put on my coloured
silk uityery fineand my new periwig
bought a good while since but durst not wear
because the plague was in westminster when
i bought it and it is a wonder what will be the
fashion after the plague is done as to periwigs
for nobody will dare to buy any hair for fear 
the infection that it had been cut out off the
heads people dead the plague
howard
i would look to the moral source
from whence all evil and suffering have been
derived and should at least endeavour to diminish
their bitterness and oh hew should
i bless god if such a worm is made the instrument
 alleviating the miseries my fellow
 lestikv
creatures and to connect more strongly the social
bond by mutual exertions for mutual relief 
pepys
 to church and heard a good sermon upon
 seek ye first the kingdom heaven and its
righteousness and all things shall be added to
you a very excellent and persuasive good and
moral sermon he showed like a wise man
that righteousness is a surer way being rich
than sin and villainy
howard
sunday evening very desirous returning
with a right spirit not only wiser but better
a cheerful humility a more general love and
benevolence to my fellowcreatures watchful 
my thoughts my words my actions resigned
to the will god that i may walk with god
and lead a more useful and honourable life in
this world
pepys
 abroad with my wife the first time that
ever i rode in my own coach which do make my
heart rejoice and praise god and pray him to
bless it to me and continue it
destiny 
howard

look forward oh my soul how low how
mean how little is every thing but what has a
view to the glorious world light life and love 
the preparation the heart is god prepare
the heart oh god thy unworthy credo
ture and unto thee be all glory through the
boundless ages eternity
what important lessons may be learned
from reading these passages said lady arabella
 who could recognise in these characters
the creation the same divine mind 
oh exclaimed edith with fervour who
but must feel the contrast which they exhibit
between the love duty and the love self 
between the pure and exalted aspirations 
christian piety and benevolence and the grovelling
sentiments mere worldly interest 
why surely no one will pretend to say
these varieties human nature are fair specimens
 any two distinct classes in the world
said the admiral who loved a little argument
for its own sake at least if there be occ
 distant
signally a howard who in all the emergencies
 life can raise his mind to the first great cause
surely we have few or no pepys in these days 
mental cultivation
 that there are few howards may be granted
said melcombe but pepys's character i
fear is neither an antiquated nor an overcharged
picture his dialect may be out fashion as his
dresses would now be but his sentiments are
those felt by all vain and vulgar minds to this
day and it must be the very truth and universality
 their application which gives his diary
its chief interest
ay to be sure said the admiral i had
forgot the breed modern dandies male and
female whose sabbathday thoughts were they
put in black and white like poor pepys's would
not be wherewithal shall i come before the
lord but how shall i most becomingly trick
out and adorn my body so as to excite the admiration
and envy my fellow creatures 
himself so much the source his delight
his maker has no beauty in his sight
as your favourite cowper says
destiny 
 and the mind cowper awfully and mysteriously
as it was occasionally eclipsed still
shone with a divine light which has awakened
and exalted the hearts thousands his fellow
creatures said melcombe
 but said the admiral if we could make
a free choice and form our own characters could
we hesitate think you in preferring the mind 
a howard to that a pepys 
 that is entirely a supposititious question
replied melcombe since we know that the
many millions spirits called into this state 
existence there are none whose natural bias
is not to evil but he who gave to howard
the power becoming a ministering spirit to
all who required his sympathy and aid and
enlightened his mind with that divine love
which communicates itself to all around he
too placed pepys in this visible world and surrounded
him with like means improvement 
yet how strange and sad to read the transcript 
his heart in his diary filled as it is with disgusting
frivolity and unfeeling levity his ideas 
god are scarcely worthy a savage moral
 bestir
toaaty he seems to have formed no eoneejtii
the sufferings others he appears to harneir
ed with perfect indifference and even wkh pleads
sure if he were likely to gain any advantage by
them surely had his one talent sadi as it
was been well applied he would have handed
down to posterity a very different account h
stewardship from that which now stains his memory

 i hope you don't mean to say it is requisite
we should all be howards said the admiral
somewhat testily
by no means replied melcombe at least
not to the same extent or in the same way but
i think each may be and many doubtless are
howards in their own sphere action were it
otherwise some our noblest faculties would
have been given in vain and must lie useless and
unemployed
but how do you account for pepys's constant
flow cheerfulness and contentment demanded
the admiral to all appearance he was a
happier man than howard 
 i cannot dignify pepys's inane selfish n
plfteency with the name happiness replied
melcombe at lest it must have been mereljt
the hairiness an animal or an idiot while
howard's must have been that an angel or
superior being his tranquillity rested on prin
doles which time would only confirm and enlarge
while the enjoyment the other depended
on mean trivial circumstances whidb could yield
no rational satisfaction and which consequently
must have been as perishable in its nature as it
was worthless in its results
believe me my good friend said the admirals
 your standard is too high were all
hearts laid as open as poor pepys's we should
find thousands and tens thousands respectable
wellbehaved people every whit as bad
many much worse and all believing themselves
on the high road to heaven
that may be said melcombe for the
scale humanity rises by innumerable steps
from the lowest to the highest state but surely
the more our moral and intellectual powers are
enlarged and improved in this stage our existence
the higher will be our destiny hereafter 
se destiny
for we can scarcely doubt that time and eternity
are but different periods the same state
requiring the same dispositions and cities 
and if so who would not have lived and died a
howard rather than a pepys 
 i like the notion our retaining our identity
said lady arabella and to think that
that manycoloured web called experience which
we weave here mingled with so many bitter
tears is to serve some purpose hereafter i have
always loved those verses gambols's where
this idea is finely expanded and she rose took
down the volume and read
the mystery life
so many years i've seen the sun
and cau'd these eyes and hands my own 
a thousand little acts i've done
and childhood have and manhood known 
o what is life and this dull round
to tread why was a spirit hound 
 so many airy draughts and lines
and warm excursions the mind
have fiird my soul with great designs
while practice gravelled far behind 
o what is thought and where withdraw
the glories which my fancy saw 
destiny 
 so many tender joys and woes
have on my quivering soul had power 
plain life with heightening passions rose
the boast or burden their hour 
o what is all we feel why fled
those pains and pleasures o'er my head 
so many human souls divine
so at one interview displayed
some oft and freely mix with mine
in lasting bonds my heart have laid 
o what is friendship why imprest
on my weak wretched dying breast 
so many wondrous gleams light
and gentle ardours from above
have made me sit like seraph bright
some moment on a throne love 
o what is virtue why had i
who am so low a taste so high 
 ere long when sovereign wisdom wills
my soul an unknown path shall tread
and strangely leave who strangely fills
this frame and waft me to the dead
o what is death tis life's last shore
where vanities are vain no more 
where all pursuits their goal obtain
and life is all retouched again 
where in their bright result shall rise
thoughts virtues friendships griefs and joys
that is a very pleasing creed and more
especially at our time day arabella said
i
 destiny
the admiral for i should be sorry to think
that after having weathered it together these
forty years we should lose sight each other
for evermore when once we parted company
come now lay aside your books and work
and get your cloaks and bonnets

chapter xxvi
on the return the little party from their
walk they found that lady waldegrave and sir
reginald had been calling at least so it was
to be inferred from cards which had been left
for each individual the family there was
also a note to edith requesting her to return
to woodlands the following day as arrangements
were now making for the theatricals in
which she was expected to bear a part a pes
expressed a hope that mr melcombe would likewise
join the party adding that a choice two
principal characters should be reserved for him asa
mark especial favour when she had read
the note edith presented it to mr melcombe
i have no right to withhold an invitation
said she but i certainly wish lady landgrave
had conveyed this one through some other
medium
 destiny
 through no other medium could it have
been so acceptable he replied as he took the
note but even through it the invitation is nota
gratifying one i am sure i need scarcely ask
what is your intention but may i beg that since
lady waldegrave has done me the honour to
insert my name in your invitation you will oblige
me by including me in your refusal 
 you shall ride there with me tomorrow and
make your own excuse said the admiral we
have been rather remiss in our duties in that
quarter
i must beg to be excused from that also
said mr melcombe
why so enquired the admiral sir
reginald left a card for you and his lady invites
you to the house in any character you choose 
what more would you have 
sir reginald could not intend to call upon
me said mr melcombe with peculiar emphasis
and colouring deeply but at any rate it is
not for me to return the visit at present the
time will come i trust when he stopped
and seemed to repress the words which were
already on his lips
destiny 
alien what asked the admiral bluntly
mr melcombe's eyes were east down as if
in meditation while his varying expression testified
that it was no tranquil kind but the
momentary cloud passed from ms brow and
looking up he said when sir reginald and
i may meet upon more equal terms than we
can do at present
i begin to think you are really a strange
fellow meleombe said the admiral gravely
 in other words a suspicious character said
meleombe forcing a smile
 no no there are no suspicions as to either
your character or circumstances both are open
as noonday but still i don't know what to make
 you
mr meleombe was silent for a few seconds 
he then said in a calm but melancholy tone
 think me as one whom a single rash imprudent
but i may add guiltless act has divested
 home friends and country but believe
me when i say the time is not far distant when
i may again claim them all
 and all i doubt not will be ready to claim
dsstinir 
in quite the admiral's remonstrances mi
melcombe permitted in going to town ike following
ddy but under promise a speedy return 
and the ladies with their veteran set off to
woodlands
they must have been nice observers who could
have detected any thing amiss beneath the smiling
surface that there met their view all
around within and without breathed only 
pleasurepleasure in its fairest most seductive
form the young the noble the beautiful seemingly
happy in themselves and rich other and
amidst all the charms nature and the refinements
 art no unpleasing thought or corroding
care was visible in lady waldegrave's
countenance which was all gaiety and delight
but it was the gaiety and delight a mind
under the influence excitement and closed
for the time against conviction or feeling she
was surrounded by a little band admirers who
seemed to vie with each other in paying homage
and offering up incense at her shrine
i am delighted to see you dear lady arabella
said she in her sweetest else manners

 and thank jcm for having brought badk'onr
runaway embracing edith as die spoke

my consent you would find it no easy matter to
obtain admiral conway's v
 o apropos sir reginald will course be
in the billiardroom i must let him know admiral
conway is here said lady waldegtayei
then tunis to edith she enquired in a
low but significant tone to
take place an exhibition i what word hook
ibgand foolish and such ingratitude when i
had been atthe expense getting a dress for
her child quite a beautiful thing fleshcoloured
silk with the sweetest little silver wings altogether
the whole device wa charming and the
effect would have been irresistible but the etc

teudessi was to have my own way and appear ia

quit the house the consequence is you seeme
here emotion choked farther utterance
 all mental suffering perhaps the most
difficult ta administer relief to by honest means
are rose which spring from wounded vanity
the only panacea for a weak vain mind in a
state irritation is flattery and htwas one
which edith would in no circumstances have
applied she sought however to soothe the
angry feelings her stepmother into compo
surly and lliento reconcile her to her disappointment
by such arguments as isle thought
best suited to ter capacity but i the attempts
were fruitless thdady would listen to nothing
but her own wrongs when in the midst

edith was confounded vafc first she tkeuglit
mounded affection and mortified lanky had actually
turned her brain till the recollection oitike
ftttf asd the great things destined foils washed
upon her memory and ijie whole mystery was
unravelled but what tui exubitii hmtoan
felly it was almost too homiuatifir to be ridiculous
 lady elizabeth went on and me the
sm bcrrnnr
mly way in virhich you can be use i to geste
her immediately and endeavour to bring liertur a
sense her duty before it is too late i am atiu
willing to foive her upon receiving a proper
apology and being invited for i now mua
insist upon being invited to act my part i shall
order my carriage for you for there is not a
moment to lose
she was ringing the bell when edith stopped
her pray excuse me lady elizabeth said
she but i cannot really undertake this office
at least take a little time to consider it and
allow me the same i
 not one instant exclaimed her ladyship
vehemently it must be done now or not at
au
 but it is late answered edith and the
admiral and lady arabella are in hopes seeing
you return with me they expect no company
so you will find a quiet family party
the thing all others i detest exclaimed
the lady peevishly i detest family dinners
and i detest cottages which are in fact neither
more nor less than small dull inconvenient
holism and if die conway imagine i am ta
remain mewed up in this babyhouses they are
much mistaken so let me hear no more the
gomvays and their clinne but go directly to
my daughter again ringing the bell violently
for the carriage
dear lady elizabeth said edith earnestly
it pains me to refuse any request yours
but indeed i cannot go to lady waldegrave
on such an errand i would do much to reconcile
you but i think with her that the appearance
you propose to make would be unbecoming her
mother the grandmother her child my
father's widow
lady elizabeth turned almost blue with anger
while she repeated grandmothers and widows 
coarse and gross who ever hears such things
in good society such terms are never used by
those who understand good manners and a
little hysterical laugh rattled in her throat she
however quickly rallied and went on however
since i m it seems your father's widow
certainly not what confers distinction upon me
you will allow i hope that i am entitled to
 dssxixy
daim the obedience his daughter and therefore
i command you to go laimediateiy to xady
waldegrave or even to her husband rend 
and represent to them how excessively ill i have
been treated by them and that i desire i maybe
invited to return and sustain my part otherwise
i insist upon my car doves and wings
being sent to me immediately and then they
shall see what it is to have incurred my displeasure

vexed as edith was she could not refrain from
smiling at the mock dignity with which this
tirade was delivered unwilling to accede to
this preposterous request or rather command
but afraid the consequences a refusal in
compassion to the wretched old woman she at
last undertook the painful because almost hopeless
task acting as mediator between her and
her daughter she was not allowed much time
to deliberation the carriage had been ordered
even before her consent had beenasked andhe
was hurried away upon her embassy 
destined 
 the purpose for which i have come said
edith
 you could only come for one purpose i am
sure interrupted her ladyship sportively the
purpose obliging me beyond expectation 
when that s done we shall then talk other
purposesof wise and good purposes such as i
often very often intend to follow and shall i
am sure some day or other begin to practise
under your auspices en attendant you will put
yourself under mine for this one day was it
not really too much that my principal jrtf
rates lady sophia marley should have sprained
her ancle and miss townshend's provoking old
grandmother have chosen to die so there are
two frightful gaps in my corps de ballet but you
will i know you will kindly fill one them
 excuse me said edith gravely i came
for a very different purposei came at the request
 lady elizabeth
lady waldegrave's countenance changed 
 what has mamma been teazing you already
with her absurdities i thought you had been at

upon being conducted to lady waldegve
edith found her not less occupied than her guests
she rehearsing her part with lord herbert while

lady waldegrave pressed her hand dearest
edith how very kind and affectionate indeed
i cannot express how much i feel obliged
to you i always was set upon having you though
you were so coy and difficult to win but however
since we have secured you that is enough
 you mistake lady waldegrave i do not
come on my own account
 oh no not at all you come upon mine
destiny 
r that reason to remain a
dpfaef suffer my alits to lie useless i
bnsiderdtdite to myself to make an appearance
loon this occasion and i told florinda that
ttiilessi was to have my own way and appear m

chapter xxxi
as lady elizabeth's night was day and her
day night edith had the undisturbed enjoyment
ai the morning to herself she therefore availed
herself the opportunity collecting the drawings
and papers which she had previously left at
the cottage and was so employed when mr
melcombe was announced her writingcase
and portefeuille were open before her and part
 their contents were scattered promiscuously
on the table at which she was seated she rose
to receive him but there was something mutual
constraint and embarrassment in the meeting
after the usual commonplace salutations
and enquiries had been exchanged mr melcombe
said as if to deprecate her coldness
i fear i have been guilty an intrusion at
this early hour but if i have you must forgive
me
vol in p
 desmnr
why should yon fear and why must i forgive
you t enquired edith with a smile
 because when there is much to hope there
is always something to fears
 there is little room for either in this ease
replied edith slightly 
 it is only indifference that would exiiude
hope or fear said he looking earnestly at her
 from any thing so indifferent in its nature
as a morning visit they surely maybe excluded
answered edith though i believe we are all
apt to expend our hopes and fears even in the
issue to be or not to be at home
 the issue even so trifling an event
may however be important he paused then
added but even if i should have trespassed
i think you will forgive me when i tell you the
offence is not likely to be soon repeated and
when next we meet i trust i shall be in different
circumstances from those in which you
have hitherto known me
his voice betrayed his emotion and'editii
was immediately struck with the thought that
he alluded to his marriage with the object his
destiny 
early affection a strange sensation oppressed
her it might be that the difference her own
fate struck her forcibly when contrasted with
the more favoured destiny another yet was
he indeed true to his early vows or had she
been unconsciously supplanting another her
heart shrunk within her at the dread surmise
alternately her cheek glowed with shame at
the idea that she was the selfdeluded sport 
an imaginary attachment and turned pale at the
thought that perfidy and falsehood could dwell
in such a mind all this was the work a
moment but she remained silent for some minutes
 then making an effort to regain her selfpossession
she said it is seldom that after a
long separation people meet under the same
circumstances the change in yours i trust
will be a happy one
 yes the change that will restore an unknown
exile to his family and country must be a happy
one said he in a voice altering with emotion

est edith how very kind and affectionate lq
deed i cannot express how much i feel obliged
to you i always was set upon having you though
you were so coy and difficult to win but how
ever since we have secured you that is enough
 you mistake lady waldegrave i do not
come on my own account
 oh no not at all you come upon mine
destined 
 the purpose for which i have comevsaid
edith
 you could only come for one purpose i am
sure interrupted her ladyship sportively tie
purpose obliging me beyond expectation 
when that is done we shall then talk other
purposes wise and good purposes such as i
often tery often intend to follow and shall i
am sure some day or other begin to practise
under your auspices en attendant you will put
yourself under mine for tjiis one day was it
not really too much that my principal jiffuf
rates lady sophia marley should have sprained
her ancle and miss townshend's provoking old
grandmother have chosen to die so there are
two frightful gaps in my carps de ballet but you
will i know you will kindly fill one themes
 excuse me said edith gravely i came
for a very different purpose i came at the r
quest lady elizabeth
lady waldegrave's countenance changed 
 what has mamma been teazing you already
with her absurdities i thought you had been at
 dsstiinr
die conwayss i sent a note there to ya this
morning
edith explained to ker that she hidbeen
sent for by lady elizabeth and described the
state in which she found her but lady wiiimer
grave wool scarcely hear her to anend 
 really thisis too tiresome eiid ship impart
twenty surrey you might know maire better
tian to pay any regard to such seines and if
she will be ridiculous it is surely better lliatshe
should be so in her own dressingrocubi ihaa in
the use the whole world nothing will induce
me to permit her to make su an exhibition
it might have passed at the court louis
quatorze when antiquated senses were quite
d la mode but in the present day such an outrage
against good taste is not to be endured 
edith gave a gentle assent as to the impropriety
 the exhibition then as delicately as
she could conveyed lady elizabeth's message 
andadded that surely something sight be done
to deprecate her displeasure and tknciliiite bc
 o after the thing is over it will be tijn
destiny ss
enough to do that rested her ladyship carelessly

 but lady elizabeth declares she is determined
to go abroad immediately unless yoii
make some concession to her said edith
 that is perhaps the very best thing she can
do replied lady waldegrave in the same tone
 indifference
 but if she goes now she leaves you in anger
ah florinda can you bear to live under a
parent's displeasure will you not rather sacrifice
the amusement which is the cause this
strife relinquish your theatrical representation
and recall your mother to your house 
 how ridiculous exclaimed lady landgrave
angrily i can scarcely suppose you
serious in making such a proposal and i really
have no leisure at present for persiflage
 indeed i am serious said edith gravely
 pshaw that must be all makebelieve i
know you wtuld make a good actress so pray
put off your bonnet and t will introduce you to
the ballroom where my corps de ballet are now
practising now do dispense with all the lack
 destimr
adaisical missis can't and wonts and in
deeds and so forth and i shall take them all fef
granted for my moments are very precious
edith saw that all hopes touching a heart wf
seared by selfishness and folly were vain si
therefore relinquished the attempt and calmly
but firmly assured lady waldegrave it would
be in vain to urge her to take a part in any
theatrical representation lady waldegrave
coloured with displeasure as she said yet you
can obstinately refuse to gratify me in so trifling
a matter while you expect i should sacrifice mown
amusement and that my friends for the
unreasonable whim another 
 it is cutis that makes the differences said
edith gently
rather our opinion what our duties are
replied lady waldegrave i consider it my
duty to make my house agreeable to my friends
and to prevent mamma from making herself
ridiculous i also think it my duty to learn my
part lord herbert said she addressing the
intended lover the piece
destiny 
 and it is mine to see that you get it by
heart is it not said he with a smile
edith rose to take leave and as she quitted
the room felt it a relief to return even to lady
elizabeth and her cottage
the unsuccessful result her embassy called
forth a fresh burst indignation from lady
elizabeth which was still farther increased when
upon demanding her car doves and wings
edith was obliged to confess she had wholly
forgotten to enquire into their fate another
messenger was immediately despatched with
orders not to return without them as with the
true spirit a little vindictive mind she seemed
wretched at the idea any one else profiting
by her misfortunes in the prospect disappointing
any such design she became more
reconciled to her own discomfiture and at length
seemed to experience positive pleasure in the
thoughts the consternation that she flattered
herself her sudden flight would occasion
 and now we must talk our arrangements
said she i have ordered my people
to have every thing ready to set oflf tomorrow
 dbsninr
i am sony my dear i must leave you behind
as i really cannot take you comfortably with
me besides girls are rather an incumbrance
ifaroad but when i am settled myself i shall
not forget you i shall endeavour to find tm ben
parti for you and i think i shall succeed but
should i fail in that you know you sirealways
the resource a convent where yml will have
the very best society so much better than liyiiig
with bourgeois relations in the mean tiflmi yoa
must remain with me till i take my departure
for i have a thousand matters to arrange
destiny 
chapter xxxi
as lady elizabeth's night was day and her
day night edith had the undisturbed enjoyment
i the morning to herself she therefore availed
herself the opportunity collecting the drawings
and papers which she had previously left at
the cottage and was so employed when mr
combe was announced her writingcase
and portefeuille were open before her and part
 their contents were scattered promiscuously
on the table at which she was seated she rose
to receive him but there was something mutual
constraint and embarrassment in the meeting
after the usual commonplace salutations
and enquiries had been exchanged mr melcombe
said as if to deprecate her coldness
 i fear i have been guilty an intnisdon at
this early hour but if i have you must forgive
me
vol iii
 destiny
why should yon fear and why must i forgive
you t enquired edith with a smile
 because when there is much to hope there
is always something to fear
there is little room for either in this case
replied edith slightly 
 it is only indifference that would excuse
hope or fear said he looking earnestly at ber
 from any thing so indifferent in its nature
as a morning visit they surely may be exclaimed
answered edith though i believe we are all
apt to expend our hopes and fears even in the
issue to be or not to be at homes
 the issue even so trying an event
may however be important he paused then
added but even if i should have trespassed
i think you will forgive me when i tell you the
offence is not likely to be soon repeated and
when next we meet i trust i shall be in different
circumstances from those in which you
have hitherto known me
his voice betrayed his emotion and edith
was immediately struck with the thought that
he alluded to his marriage with the object bf his
f 
bestint 
early affection a strange sensation oppressed
her it might be that the difference her awn
fate struck her forcibly when contrasted with
the more favoured destiny another yet was
he indeed true to his early vows or had she
been unconsciously supplanting another her
heart shrunk within her at the dread surmise
alternately her cheek glowed with shame at
the idea that she was the selfdeluded sport 
an imaginary attachment and turned pale at the
thought that perfidy and falsehood could dwell
in such a mind all this was the work a
moment but she remained silent for some minutes
 then making an effort to regain her selfpossession
she said it is seldom that after a
long separation people meet under the same
circumstances the change in yours i trust
will be a happy one
 yes the diane that will restore an unknown
exile to his family and country must be a happy
one said he in a voice faltering with emotion
 that will entitle him to do what as a
friendless unknown adventurer he dares not
to seekrthe regard one long and truly and
fondly loved
 destiny
there was no mistaking the tone and the look
which accompanied the words these declared the
secrets a heart too noble for dissimulation
yet edith strove to repel the thought that she
could be the object his love ahd while deep
blush mantled her cheek she said is she then
not aware the constancy your attachment p
 iqlu i hope she is replied he and that
even in absence and under doubts and suspi
cions she will believe that a time will come
when all will be cleared up would she be
wrong in granting me this much hope 
 i cannot tell said edith faintly and she
would have withdrawn the hand he had taken
ah do not say so cried he earnestly ashe
still retained it
 i cannot judge for another said edith in
increasing confusion
no not for another for yourself 
and she so long and truly loved said
edith in tones scarcely audible
 it is she whom i now ask only to believe
that one day i may aspire to her regardwhen
the mystery which now excludes me from her
destiny 
sympathy is disclosed is this asking too match 
he said in deep agitation
 no said edith in a low faltering voice
 that is enough he exclaimed as a glow
 pleasure lighted up his countenance in
the midst dear approving friends then you
will acknowledge me 
on the table which stood before them some
drawings lay scattered and as edith in confusion
turned her eyes from the deep earnest gazcf
which was fixed upon her they fell upon a view
 inch orran by sunset the parting gift 
lucy beneath were written these words from
ossian 
my soul is fnu other times 
the joy my youth returns
there said she in emotion is the dear
home where ere long i hope to be
ok and tones and
words that told the lost the dead came
thronging upon her in a strange confusion mingling
with the present the living stronger
and stronger the visions crowded on her brain
she felt as if reason was forsaking her with
the paleness death on her brow and eyes which
seemed as if bursting from their sockets she
started up and exclaimed who oh in
mercy tell me who her gaze was fixed on
him with an expression fearful scrutiny but
 stint
ker pale lip were unable to utter more her
lines agitation was almost equal to er own 
words seemed to be struggling fmr utterances
wulcl yet by a mighty effort he restrained thni
at lengthy in a voice deep yet subdued emotions
he said edith i have not deceived you
can you trust me 
 oh you know not what you are doing p
she exclaimed as she withdrew her hands wildly
from his you know not the dark the wild
the impossible things i fitncy and she gasped
as she spoke and drew shuddering away
 edith dearest edith believe only believe
that i am true and that nothing is impossible

 what not that the seas should give up their
dead cried she frantically
 not their dead but edith do not oh
do hot tempt me thus to break a vow rashly
perhaps impiously taken but which i hold sacred
in a little while a few short months the time
will come dearest most beloved my first 
my only love say that you will yet trust me 
and then and then let us part 
destiny 
for some minutes edith could not speak but
at length restored to composure by the angruib
which clouded his brow she fidndy articulated
i i do 
at inch orran then let us meet there
let me find you there let me claim you
edith faintly breathed a single word a name
which had ever lain cherished in her heart
yours and only yours dearest edith by
whatever name to all else dead forgotten 
oh not forgotten cried edith bursting
into tears still still loved and mourned 
edith i conjure you tempt me not make
not the error my youth to bring down perjury
and dishonour upon me now you have said you
would trust me may i not trust you 
in a moment edith conquered her tremors 
her tears were arrested in their course she did
not speak but the look with which she gave him
her hand needed not words to attest her resolution
melcombe pressed it to his lips and tore
himself away

how like a dream a vision the night fid
this brief and passing scene appear to edith
again and again she asked herself gould ft be
that the lost the lamented had thus as itirene
started into life that the loved companion 
her childish days was now the chosen her matured
affections and these affections had they
been lightly transferred could affectioiffi once
so blighted as hers had been ever again revive
and own a second spring was it indeed love
that she now owned and felt oh how different
iron that which had cast its dazzling and
delusive glare over her young imagination and
tinged so many the radiant years yontli
with colours fair tis true but fading as the tints
 the rainbow
love had formerly been a sentimenta fiilse
naltow exclusive sentknentliared only by tb
object which inspired it now it was a noble
generous diffusive principle which glowed in
her heart and sought to impart a portion its
own blessedness around she had loved reginald
as she could have loved any thing that fancy
had painted to her as feir and eisoinating she
had invested him with every noble and generous
attribute which the young and imaginative so
lavishly bestow on those they love but the
illusion had long since been dispelled never
again to gather over her heart again she loved
but by a light which could not deceive by that
divine light which taught her not to love the
mere perishing idol life's passing hour but
the immortal being with whose soul her own
might joy to claim kindred throughout eternity
and the dear ones who still mourned his losssoh
theirs would be rapture almost to agony 
but she dared not allow her thoughts to dwell
on such a theme
it was long ere her spirits were sufficiently
tranquillized to admit her returning to the frivolous
being with whom she was still associated

the day was far advanced ere she made
her appearance if possible in increased ill humour
as she dawdled over her defender ia
jinirfhette suddenly the sound horses feet at
full speed was heard advancing and as edith
raised her eyes she caught a glimpse one

the apartment as monsieur lamotte altered
like hastened to find the servant and lean from
himself what had actually taken place but the
man seemed too much stunned and surprised to
be able to give a clear account what had happened
what he did relate however was sufficiently
tragical and appalling sir regimen
had fought that morning with lord herbert
and been brought home severely wounded the
report his death had circulated among his creditors
and executions wereulready in the house
lady waldegrave was in fits and left almost
alone the party having dispersed
such was the amount the intelligence wiui
which edith returned to the breakfasttable
 this is too shocking much too shocking v
exclaimed lady elizabeth in ose her hysterical
tremors m that which she had witnessed
not many hours before then all had beeii
sunshine and gaiety and melody now the
day chill aa dviu e yelt lawdtyand
beauteous flower beds were already deqp 
d ridden down we ldu i m
 tbe house the broad might steps was strewed
with every description furniture and value

exotics had been overturned or broken in pieces
and their fragments lajk mingled with the che

hardenedlooking men were pushing and
swearing at one another as they each laid daim
to some article value and their loud execrate
tons and tumultuous din were still worse than
the silent mementos ruin which lay scattered
around the hall lately filled with the fairest
works italy now presented a similar scene 
devastation the publie rooms were fast 
 lady waldegrave's suite had already
be despoiled its treasures shuddering bt
this painful spectacle edith after some delay
got one the housemaids to conduct her to
lady waldegrave as she passed along she
met sane the surgeons coming from sir begins
bald's apartment and she was relieved to bear
 ininr
horn him that tke wound was not considered
dangerous that the ball which had entered die
fleshy part the shoulder had been safely eac
enacted the only danger now to be dreaded
was from the agitation mind occasioned by
the distressing scenes that were passing and
which it was impossible wholly to conceal from
his knowledge with a heart lightened half
its cares for the wretched finite one who had
been so dear to her edith followed her guide
shuddering with horner at the scenes ferocious
pillage she every where encountered at lengthy
in a chamber in the attics she found the refuge
 the hapless mistress all this splendid ruin 
lady waldegrave was extended on the bed
perfectly calm as if from exhaustion but with
misery and despair impressed on every feature
on edith's entrance she half opened her eyes
but immediately dosed them as if determined
neither to notice nor be noticed edith however
approached the bed and taking the hand
which lay almost powerless by her pressed it in
hers still lady waldegrave remained immovable

dtiinr s
edith was silent for some minutes aiengtk
she said i hare come on lady elizabeth's
account as well as my own she charged me t
express to you her sorrow on this occasioned
lady waldegrave made no reply she will
come to you i am sure if you wish itf rei
some edith but she received no answer in
the meantime if i can be any service td
you 
 oh those horrid sounds exclaimed lady
waldegrave shrieking and burying her face in
her pillow as a volley abuse and imprecations
ascended from beneath her window will no
one save me from this and wild hysterical
sobs shook her frame
 i fear it is impossible said edith sooth
gfy distressing as it is do try to bear it 
 is diere nobody to assist me nobody to
drive away these people these robbers they
have seized even my jewels ie exclaimed
casting her eyes up to heaven as if in appeal
this is indeed a trial painful for you to
endure said edidi in the same gentle tone 
 but distressing as it is there is still comfort in
sm destiny
ike midst it what a consolation to know ilt
sir reginald's wound is not dangerous uusf
waldemar waved her head with a gesture iib
impatience ah florinda think what it might
have been to himself what he might have inflicted
on another and thank god it is no'wome
 he could hare done nothing worse than he
has done exclaimed she passionately he
has been the ruin my happiness mj fot
tone my reputation this very name is lily
abhorrence 
edith's blood ran cold oh florinda id
mercy do not talk thus remember he is your
husband the father your child 
 and has been the ruin myself and my
child by his madness but do not mention h
edith feared there was guilt no less than folly
in the case or at least imprudence bordering 
upon guilt and she said in a filtering voice
 i am ignorant the cause this unhappy
reneoritre 
lady waldegrave's colour rose then iii
well you should remain so but no that cannot
be ywi will hear a thousand lies and you wiu
destiny 
piedbtaps beueye them all as some other mj
ficicds have done and like them you will deceit
fie ia the time need v
 nv said edith happen what may i will
not desei you in your present situation
again lady waldegrave's colour deepened
while with a rising at her throat she said
vwhat not even if you should be told that
my husband fought to avenge his honour 
edith became pale as death and for some
minutes she was unable to articulate at length
in a low voice deep emotion she said not
even then could i forsake you in the hour ojf
need
fou a moment lady waldegrave appeared
slightly touched then in increasing confusion
she went on the world had chosen to give
n lord herbert as a lover i need not tell you
who know me and had opportunities judging 
for yourself that it was a mere idle or malicious
rumour such as are circulated in thousands
every day and which nobody pays any regard
tq but having drank too much wine or lost too
moth money or in short i cannot tel how r
 destiny
but in a moment delirium sir reginald thought
proper to become jealous and to insult lord
herbert the consequence was it was necessary
they should go out this morning judge then
whether i have not cause resentment 
 i cannot judge said edith faintly nod
only can judge but if you are innocent
can you doubt it interrupted lady waldegrade
indignantly
 at least there must have been imprudence
to justify the suspicion guilt said editfa
 i am no hypocrite i never studied appearances

 then since conscious your innocence
you can more easily forgive sir reginald if the
imprudence has been his said edith
you know not what i have to forgive
cried lady waldegntve passionately when
brought home even in presence my servants
he ordered me from his sight can i forgive
such an insult as that 
forgive all as you hope to be fojiycsn
said edit
 do not talk to me any more this horrid
destiny 
affair for heavens sake but tell me what i shall
do how i shall get away from these dreadful
scenes
sir reginald cannot be removed said
edith surely then you will not leave the
house while he is in it 
to what purpose should i remain cried
lady waldegrave impatiently
 to be near him replied edith
what after having suffered so great an
indignity 
 yes assuredly he must have suffered he
is still suffering much on your account his state
must still be precarious
pshaw nonsense the wound is a mere
nothing dr smith told me so himself
 but the agitation his mind may render it
dangerous should it prove so as who can tell 
and if in the prospect danger he should wish
to see you once more to exchange forgiveness 
ah florinda could you ever forgive yourself if
you had forsaken your husband's dying bed 
but how is it possible for me to remain in
this wretched state she exclaimed giving way
to m tioknt bunt lielfiflli scmrow m she emu
her eyes around the room
 tills apartment is quite comfortable said
edith and if you will allow me i will share
it with you while you remain but oh do not
think quitting the house while your husband is
in it if as you say your reputation is at stake
surely even on that account you are better here
than you could be ebenriiere
tliatoonsideration seemed to handsome welglit
and at length edith prevailed she therelbrc
sent back the carriage to lady elizabeth wmi a
note to prepare her for what she had to encounters
and a request that she would lose no timem 
coming to her daughter then with all ike ardour
and sweetness christian charity she devoted
herself to the task she had undertaken stip 
porting the wretched being thus thrown upcm her 
compassion

although lady waldegrave had expressed
a wish that her mother should come to her yet
no sooner did she hear her arrival than it was
apparent it had only been for the sake appear
areas she had desired her presence yer
ifays sake do not suffer mamma to talk to
me ied she to edith it will kill me if
shf skies i cannot be tortured with questions
ijiallgo distracted if she talk what has
past
but the duel its causes and consequences
had made slight impression on lady elizabeth's
mind in comparison the execution and its
effects these together with her own injuries
and distresses affected her so much that sometime
elapsed before she was sufficiently com
vol in q
 distant
posed to be conducted to her daughter for
some time sobs and broken exclamations irene
all the conversation
i know not whereto go said lady walden
despairingly
 how foolish my dear to talk so canst you
goto town
 and find things worse if possible than even
heres replied lady wamegrave in the sametone

 i knew it would do
t dbbnirr
yoa good aod that i should feel more comfortable
 for you know there are suck absurd things
said upon these occasions my maid told me
this morning the talk in the neighboorlicmkl was
that you had actually gone off with lord herbert
diocking and foolish that sir rald had
pursued you and fought and in short i can't
tell you what ridiculous things are sud but it
is quite a comfort to me to see you so well
although you do look pale but surely those
odiottf people will be obliged to replace everything
 and d propos they can have no right
whatever to my car and doves and i assure you
those wings cost me a great deal money how
kind in lady hey wood to take poor dudley out
 the way 
in this manner she continued to babble on till
she took her departure with a promise reining
the following day but in the interim she
had caught cold by her visit to woodlands she
said which kept her at home and lady landgrave
was seized with a nervous feverish attack
which confined her to bed slighted sid neglected
by the few attendants who remained it
jstiny i
wbs edith's part to nurse and tend her which
she did day and night with the most unremitting
ware and tenderness
florinda received many pretty little pink and
ihie bits from dear friends in town who were
dying to hear her and some even left cards 
enquiry in the course their morning's airing 
but not one came to offer personal aid or sympathy
lady elizabeth seemed to think she had
amply discharged her maternal duties by a single
visit for the next account her was that she
shad set off for paris where she said she would
expect to hear from dear florinda before proceeding
to rome where it was absolutely necessary
she should winter
admiral and lady arabella conway had been
kindly attentive and done all in their power to
promote the comfort the wretched pair titus
thrown for the present on the resources their
friends they were not ignorant the rumours
that were afloat concerning the cause the
duel and without pretending to form a judgment
on way or other they had from the first
 agreed with edith on the propriety lady
 stint
waldegrave remaining where she was ske
teemed now on the brink a precipice and a
uncle false step might plunge her in irretrievable
ruin she had also abated much the
ugly tone which she had at first assumed and it
was evident she was willing to submit to at lea
the appearance a reconciliation
during this period sir reginald had been
making rapid progress towards recovery aa was
learned from his medical attendants for ndier
by word or deed had he taken the slightest notice
 lady waldegrave the timc was now come
however when some explanation must takeplaee
he had been able for the first time to be moved
into the study adjoining his dressingroom and
haying stood that trial he bad declared his determination
 being remoy ed to town the following
day on receiving this information florinda
appeared overwhelmed with surprise and mortification
it was evident from this that itwas sir
reginald's intention to abandon hero leave
her destitute friendless almost penniless 
with a stain upon her reputation which tibi desertion
would render for eyer indelible la the
destiny 
tumult her feelings she wrote to him but her
letter was returned in a blank cover unopened
when the first burst passionate indignation at
this insult had subsided she besought edith to
see him and learn from himself what his intentions
were to represent to him the sacrifice she
had made in refusing to quit the house while he
remained in it and finally that it was the opinion
 her family and friends that no separation
ought to take place at present no office could
be more revolting to edith's feelings than the
one she was thus called on to undertakeand
by whom by her who had so cruelly supplanted
her in those affections which had once
been her all was it indeed possible she was
called upon to go a supplicant for favour to her
now deserted rival but edith's pure and generous
heart felt no base triumph at the thought 
no unhallowed gleam pleasure shone in her sad
but pitying eyes as she beheld the wretchedness
 one who had wrought her so much woe 
florinda's tears and entreaties prevailed over
edith's better judgment and finer feelings and
e sent to request an interview witl sir b
 desnvt
daldl only the parity and die rectitude unintentional
could have justified to herself the step
she was now taking in thus interfering between
those bound by so near and holy a tie a ti
which when once burst asunder can never be
hallowed and blest again i v
it was with such painful and embarrasaagf
feelings that iith entered the apartment whsft
sir reginald lay reclining on a so pale asd
emaciated with the languor sickness and art
row diffused over his form and features he rose
to receive her his wounded arm suspended in m
sling and as he extended his hand to her she
shuddered as she thought how recently that hand
had been uplifted to take away the life am
other both were deeply affected and for some
minutes neither spoke at length making an
effort he said this is a kind visit edith if i
cannot say more his voice tered and
he stopped
 do not say any thing on that subjects
replied edith gently it is enough that you
believe it is kindly meant
sir reginald pointed to an open letter which
destiny 
tumult her feelings lie wrote to urn but her
letter was returned ia a blank cover unopened
when the first burst passionate indignation at
this insult had subsided dbe besought edith to
see him and learn from himself what his intentions
were to represent to him the sacrifice she
had made in refusing to quit the house while he
remained in it said finally that it was the opinion
 her finely and friends that no separation
ought to take place at present no office could
be more revolting to edith's feelings than the
one she was thus called on to undertake and
by whom by her who had so cruelly supplanted
her in those affections which had once
been her all was it indeed possible she was
called upon to go a supplicant for your to her
now deserted rival but edith's pure and generous
heart felt no base triumph at the thought 
no unhallowed gleam pleasure shone in her sad
but pitying eyes as she beheld the wretchedness
 one who had wrought her so much woe 
florinda's tears and entreaties prevailed over
edith's better judgment and finer feelings and
e sent to request an interview witl sir ri
 desnvt
oaldl only the parity and lite rectitude htr
intentions could have justified to herself the shep
she was now taking in thus interfering between
those bound by so near and holy a tie a ti
which when once burst asunder can nerert be
hallowed and blest again rev
it was with such painful and embarrassing
feelings that edith entered the apartment whist
sir reginald lay reclining on a sob pale asd
emaciated with the languor sickness and art
row diffused over his form and features thereto
receive her his wounded arm suspended in 
sling and as he extended his hand to her ah
shuddered as she thought how recently that hand
had been uplifted to take away the life aiir
other both were deeply affected and for some
minutes neither spoke at length making aft
effort he said tbm is a kind visit edith if i
cannot say more his voice faltered and
he stopped 
do not say any thing on that subject
replied edith gently it is enough that you
believe it is kindly meant
sir reginald pointed to an open letter which
lay on the table before him and while wounded
pride seemed to struggle with better feeling he
said do you know from whence this came 
is it from admiral conway 
edith took the paper on which was simply
written a loan from an old friend it ccm
stained bills to the amount five hundred pounds 
and even through the attempted disguise the
hand she recognised with an emotion surprise
and pleasure the writing mr melcombe
 i am certain it is not from admiral conway's
she said but there is a subject greater
interest i would speak to you 
 i am aware all you have done said sir
reginald and i know you can mean nothing
that is not good but added he in increasing
agitation the best intentions may be mistaken
they who mean well mal be misled
edith hesitated to proceed as she perceived
him already prepared to deprecate the introduction
 the subject on which she had come and
she remained silent and irresolute
in a few minutes sir reginald with more iirm
sed mutiny
nid there is onetidgeet ditii and
only one which i would not laye you iwimf to
mamm any other say what you whl
 i will not affect io misunderstand you sir
bcginald said edith there is a subject which
yoa may well deem too delicate to be intended
imml ifeelitisso andunferyiuii iwwvld
be qxired
 i believe yo v replied sir reginald bitterly
 snnt
ten rose to her eyes she felt she could say
no more
sir ronald made another effort to regain his
firmness but his voice still tered when he
gait this is perhaps the only request x cxmid
have refused you but i do refuse it my happiness
has been sacrificed my confidence has been
for ever destroyed and tis in vain to strive to
renew it he paused then resigned in a firm
and decided tone when i go to town
arrangements shall be immediately made for a
final separation all that can be done for her
comfort shall be done on my part now grot
bless you edith will you not say as much forme

 ah reginald said edith as the tears dropt
upon the hand which held hers the blessings
which i would ask for you god are those
which you would reject but i do ask bbm
added she with fervour to bless you with the
knowledge himself they pressed each
other's hands in silences and parted for ever 
there was more indignation than sorrow
in lady waldegrave's emotion when made acdestiny

quaint with her husband's determination the
same day having received a remittance from
sir reginald she set off for paris to join ladyelizabeth

at oakley house to await the arrival the ribless

chapter xxxiv
the autumn was now eu advanced and even
amid the pomp groves and garniture fields
eklith sighed as she thought that glorious
effulgence which at this season more especially
would be lighting up her own mountain land 
 those setting suns not as in softer climes
sinking gently and imperceptibly to rest but
retiring in the full majesty a splendid retinue
 gorgeous clouds and even with their last rays
imparting new beauty to the purple mountain
the green wave and the grey rock and oh 
what thickcoming fancies what visions even
earthly joy were now associated in her mind
with the thoughts her highland home 
the admiral and lady arabella were aware
 the attachment which had informed between
her and melcombe but they felt satisfied when
destiny 
they also learnt that it was when she should be
in the midst her nearest and dearest friends
he was to return to claim her and from their
hands that he was to receive her after repeated
delays the ribleys at length arrived and edith
to the mutual regret herself and her kind
friends bade them adieu and returned once
more to the grove and the mall the delays
had been occasioned by mrs ribley's illness 
she had had several bilious attacks and was still
evidently deut from being convalescent she
nevertheless relaxed nothing her minute observances
but pursued her course small dull
frivolous occupations with unabated rigour
been very near losing kitty my dear 
said mr ribley to edith with a shake the
head sad thing if i had lost kitty my dear
 you are very good mr ribley said his
lady gravely and it did occur to me that
shoidd you have been deprived me probably
your best plan would have been at a proper
period to have paid your addresses to our tried
and excellent friend mrs rose poplin
 dsfitiny
 sure my dear if i didn't flikik the rei
same thing mce little woman is mrs rose
pretty fortune her own iemd sure my deer
if it hadn't been for her the water southey
would have been quite spoiled 
mrs macauley had made many attempts to be
permitted to return to her cottage but in vain all
her efforts to extricate herself from johnnie and 
hit small people were fruitless they had one 
and all them discovered her value and while
she remained within their reach it was evident
she would never be suffered to rest edith had
gone to visit her as often as it was in her power
and had found her the inmate a small crowned
noisy dwelling beset with spoiled sickly children
hanging round her clinging to her leaning
and sitting upon her in all directions the ef
feet all this was beginning to be visible upm
her her neat straight back seemed bending as
if more from the weight children than ixf
years her cheeks were drawn down as if by
the constant stroaking fond hands her bright
sunny eyes looked red and heavy as if from
want sleep and she said she thought die
dkstnrr 
wis getting a little deaf but maybe it turns
only the din the bairns poor doings albof
gedier die had got what mrs johnnie in her
dialect called a puled look edith grieved
to behold the ravages committed upon her dear
old friend by the concentrated affection offa
whole family prevailed so far as to have har
brought to the cottage for a week or two previous
to the time when the ribleys were to
remove to town
 oh my dear said she to edith as the
first day her return she sat in the little garden
basking in the mild rays an autumnal sun
 now dearest edith the time is come when
ijkay claim you as my own tomorrow
shall be at inch orran stomorrow i shall again
jiehold the dear ones i so madly deserted the
qpicealment nine long years will be at an
eod out oh jiow dearly bought has this happy
y been to all with what shame i now
close the wild act boyish romance which has
so long divided us nine years ago i returned
a shipwrecked seaboy to my home but i learnt
that my return would bring only poverty and
ruin n all i loved i saw them seemingly happy
i believed myself forgotten and i resolved
to sacrifice myself to the continuance the
happiness and prosperity osiers i fled far
frsn all i loved in my delirium i even rashly
impiously bound myself by a solemn vow'nevr
 desire
to reveal myself till the period arrived when i
oottld give them a right to all the pooseasioiis
they then enjoyed but wick my return t
that time would have stripped them tis to you
edith i commit my cause to dead for meividi
the dear parents i so cruelly injured by bearing
the holy tie which should have bound me
to them but they will forgive me you will
be the link again to unite us to your hatads
then i commit herself to your discretion i trust
the communication oh how my heart has pined
for this time and how it feels overwhelmed at
die very thought my mother pray for her
pray with her and pray too my firstmy only
love for your
 ronald malcoim
 tomorrow was it indeed so near and
how prepare their hearts for the tide joy wiiieh
was about torush in upon them hen call
upon them to give up the dead which had o
long lain shrouded there and receive in exchange
the living to their arms o no itnras
not possible to prepare them for such transition
destiny j
it was by na slow aad aadnal light tete truth
could be learned one single ray must flash
instantaneous conviction on their souls it was
this consciousness which had hitherto retained
her from all attempts at a gradual disclosure if
the idea once took possession the mind with
nought to feed and sustain it but a baseless hope
and vague surmise it could only serve to fever
and disturb the imagination better it were that
nolmng should be hinted till all could be told
but she must first still the tumult her own
heart that she might find gentle access to those
rf others while yet unable to compose her
spirits sufficiently to venture on the allotted talc
a gently tap at the door was followed by ae
entrance mrs malcolm who struck by the
agitation edith's manner and alarmed at her
protracted absence came to be satisfied if all
were well she looked wiihi earnest enquiry
on edith's eloquent countenance where all was
struggling to reveal itself
 edith said she taking her hand your
sjit seems strangely stirred if it is with joy
youi willsnr shlureiwithine if it is grief
sis distant
or anxiety will you not suffer me to ekare it
with you 
 oh it is something that differs from ail
replied edith with emotion it it joy but
joy so strange so
mrs malcolm looked at her with surprise
 it seems indeed strange that any joy sihouki
with have such an effect upon you
 no oh no you would not say so if you
kaew if you could guess her heart throbbed
violently and her colour went and came
with the quickness lightning
 then will you not tell me my lore what
it is that thus strangely moves you said her
fiend soothingly
after a struggle to repress her feelings di
succeeded she became perfectly calnii but
very pale as she said do you remember
when once we talked happiness i knew
not then what it was but i believed you happy
she stopped
 well my love enquired mrs malcolm
in a tone surprise
 you said you were not resumed edith
in a low suffocated voice that wandering
thoughts wild dreams one d
 
 my ronald said mrs malcolm mournfully
 yes long too long i struggled with
the mingled feelings despondency and hope
and fear
 you believed that he had perished said
fxlith once more regaining her composure
 at the thirteen years could you
wish me to doubt it said mrs malcolm almost
reproachfully
but you did once hope even while you
feared
mrs malcolm sighed but now the hope
and the fear are even as he is no more 
hope never dies it is said rejoined edith
with a beating heart
mrs malcolm waved her head sorrowfully
and a sigh was her only answer
at least it may revive return with god
hall things are possible he can loose the prisoner's
bonds he can set the captive free he
m dtvx
can recall tle dead to life oh he can make
even the seas give up their dead 
struck with the trembling fervour her
tones for a moment mrs malcolm receded the
deep glowing expression edith's countenance 
then as the sudden conviction flashed upon her
she wildly exclaimed my son oh do not
mock me say
edithopened her arms to receive her and
while tears rapture streamed from her eyes
she faintly articulated he lives 
the mother uttered no cry shed no tears 
she stirred not breathed not but every fibre
seemed as if stiffening into stone while with
pale lips and fixed but vacant eye she gazed
wistfully upon edith as though she looked on
some fearful and delusive thing
will you not shed one tear breathe one
word thanks to god said edith soothingly

for what enquired mrs malcolm fearfully
as she laid her trembling hand on edith's
 for ronald who lives and comes to bless
and be blessed by you 
destiny s
at length the mother's tears did flcvr and the
fervent ejaculation broke from her lips then
she called eagerly for her husband for the dear
partner all her joys and sorrows to share in
the blest tidings and edith left them to the
overflow feelings too sacred for aught but the
eye heaven to witness soon the joyful
tidings spread and every where they were received
with rapture for ronald's name and
memory had ever been fondly cherished far and
near lucy her husband and two lovely children
were hastily summoned to complete the
happy group that waited impatiently to welcome
the wanderer's return tomorrow 
the blest tomorrow when when would it
come 
hours crept slowly along hours years 
ages they seemed to those longing hearts whose
only cry was my son my son 
but these hours passed away the day was
drawing to a close and now the evening was
come such an evening as that on which ronald
had torn himself from all he loved calm fair
and holy there sat the mother even as then
 
 destiny
the glorious firmament and the glowing waters
spread out before her but her fervent eye was
fixed with unvarying gaze on the going down 
the sun as though she sought to hasten its tardy
course by marking each lessening ray that
sun whose next rising was to form a new epoch
in her existence and edith was by her watching
the course a still distant boat which was
rowed swiftly along its course was directed to
inch orran with varying colour she marked
its progress nearer and nearer it drew it
reached the point and in an instant with light
step one sprang on shore
us he she exclaimed starting up
tis ronald ronald is come p was the
glad cry which broke from every lip
eager steps the threshold pressing
open arms in haste advancing
joyful looks through blind tears glancing 
the gladsome bounding his aged hound
say he in truth is here our long long lost is found x
but no such manifestations delight came
 the beacon
destiny 
from the mother as lie was clasped in the arms
 her son her joy was too deep for words or
looks or outward tokens and long she remained
unconscious whose were the arms that supported
her whose the warm tears that dropped
upon her pale cheek when at length by
these fond cares recalled to consciousness ah
what a gaze was that which dwelt upon those
dear and cherished features changed they might
be to other eyes but the look the one look 
her own child what can efface that from the
mother's heart still all seemed but as a dream
till with his family and household assembled
round him she heard the father offer up to god
his thanks for the recovery his longlost son 
that the gift was acknowledged with tears 
pious gratitude to him the giver every good
and perfect gift 
the admiral kept his word lady arabella
and he came to inch orran to witness the celebration
 a highland wedding benbowie also
was forthcoming in a waistcoat ten times nitre
conspicuous than ever that was very true
on my conscience that was very true what you
 dbstimt
said the grasdngs said he to mrs macaulay
as dough he had been ruminating on it ever
since ai i've brought a thousand pound fora
tocher to glenro js daughter
 ah benbowie that is like you but deed
you've been rather long thinking it for
providence has been as kind to her as to the
little bee that it feeds from dew and clouds and
now there's the sunshine and the flowers and
she wants for nothing
the marriage ronald and edith was blessed
by the venerable mr stewart and the admit
oral and mrs macauley danced a highland reel
with great spirit in honour it thus when
it was ended she communed with her partner
upon the event oh what curious creatures
we are to think if glenroy was to look up what
would he say to see his dochter the wife ronald
malcolm after all i not a bit but he was
very near casting out with me once for evening
her to such a thing oh should not that make
us humble and trustful when it is shown to us
poor blind craters that it is not in man that
walketh to direct his steps and to se how
destiny 
beautifully it is appointed to us as to the uftatral
creation to have our tribulations and our consolations
if we would but look to the hand that
sends them for as the old hieland distich says
but as you do not understand gaelic i must
give it to you in english
 there is neither knoll nor rising
nor yellow green grassy hillock
that will not for a space time he joyous
and for a while he sad and tearful

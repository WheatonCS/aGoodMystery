very best quality look at the
band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could
afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no
hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world

well that is clear enough certainly but how about the
foresight and the moral retrogression

sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting
his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a
sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his
way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see
that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly
which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other
hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not
entirely lost his self-respect

your reasoning is certainly plausible

the further points that he is middle-aged that his hair is
grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses
lime-cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of
hair-ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all
appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of
lime-cream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while
the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in
the best of training

but his wife you said that she had ceased to love him

this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear
watson with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat and
when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear
that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
affection

but he might be a bachelor

nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
wife remember the card upon the bird's leg

you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce
that the gas is not laid on in his house

one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i
see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt
that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
burning tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never
got tallow-stains from a gas-jet are you satisfied

well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as
you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm
done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a
waste of energy

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew
open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment
with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
astonishment

the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped

eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off
through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon
the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face

see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out
his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but
of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
point in the dark hollow of his hand

sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said
he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you
have got

a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though
it were putty

it's more than a precious stone it is the precious stone

not the countess of morcar's blue carbuncle i ejaculated

precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i
have read the advertisement about it in the times every day
lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be
conjectured but the reward offered of pounds is certainly
not within a twentieth part of the market price

a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire
plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us

that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
recover the gem

it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i
remarked

precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner
a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
jewel-case the evidence against him was so strong that the case
has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the
matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers
glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out
doubled it over and read the following paragraph

hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst
abstracted from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the
valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder
upper-attendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room of the countess
of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had
remained with horner some little time but had finally been
called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared
that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco
casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was
accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the
dressing-table ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was
arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found
either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to
the countess deposed to having heard ryder's cry of dismay on
discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room
where she found matters as described by the last witness
inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest
of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence
in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for
robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate
refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to
the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion
during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was
carried out of court

hum so much for the police-court said holmes thoughtfully
tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the
sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you
see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the
stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry
baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set
ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to
do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie
undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if
this fail i shall have recourse to other methods

what will you say

give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at
the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr
henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at
b baker street that is clear and concise

very but will he see it

well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor
man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson
that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must
have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to
see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency
and have this put in the evening papers

in which sir

oh in the globe star pall mall st james's evening news
standard echo and any others that occur to you

very well sir and this stone

ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say
peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
of the one which your family is now devouring

when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light it's a bonny thing said he just
see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and
focus of crime every good stone is they are the devil's pet
baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found
in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable
in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is
blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has
already a sinister history there have been two murders a
vitriol-throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about
for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal
who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
gallows and the prison i'll lock it up in my strong box now and
drop a line to the countess to say that we have it

do you think that this man horner is innocent

i cannot tell

well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had
anything to do with the matter

it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an
absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he
was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple
test if we have an answer to our advertisement

and you can do nothing until then

nothing

in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall
come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i
should like to see the solution of so tangled a business

very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i
believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i
ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop

i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half-past
six when i found myself in baker street once more as i
approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i
arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to
holmes room

mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair
and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr
baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is
more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have
just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker

yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat

he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a
broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of
grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight
tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his
habits his rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded
from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a
slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the
impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
ill-usage at the hands of fortune

we have retained these things for some days said holmes
because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise

our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not
been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had
no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a
hopeless attempt at recovering them

very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to
eat it

to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his
excitement

yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so
but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is
about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your
purpose equally well

oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of
relief

of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of
your own bird so if you wish 

the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as
relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly
see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i
will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive
upon the sideboard

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
of his shoulders

there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the
way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a
better grown goose

certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly
gained property under his arm there are a few of us who
frequent the alpha inn near the museum we are to be found in
the museum itself during the day you understand this year our
good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which
on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to
receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the
rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a
scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with
a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way

so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the
door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing
whatever about the matter are you hungry watson

not particularly

then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
up this clue while it is still hot

by all means

it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly
in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passers-by blew out
into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out
crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter
wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into
oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at
the alpha inn which is a small public-house at the corner of one
of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open
the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
the ruddy-faced white-aproned landlord

your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese
said he

my geese the man seemed surprised

yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker
who was a member of your goose club

ah yes i see but you see sir them's not our geese

indeed whose then

well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden

indeed i know some of them which was it

breckinridge is his name

ah i don't know him well here's your good health landlord
and prosperity to your house good-night

now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat
as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though
we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we
have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal
servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible
that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we
have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police
and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us
follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and
quick march

we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a
zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest
stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor
a horsey-looking man with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
helping a boy to put up the shutters

good-evening it's a cold night said holmes

the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
companion

sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the
bare slabs of marble

let you have five hundred to-morrow morning

that's no good

well there are some on the stall with the gas-flare

ah but i was recommended to you

who by

the landlord of the alpha

oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen

fine birds they were too now where did you get them from

to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman

now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms
akimbo what are you driving at let's have it straight now

it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the
geese which you supplied to the alpha

well then i shan't tell you so now

oh it is a matter of no importance but i don't know why you
should be so warm over such a trifle

warm you'd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am
when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end
of the business but it's where are the geese and who did you
sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one
would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the
fuss that is made over them

well i have no connection with any other people who have been
making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you won't tell us
the bet is off that is all but i'm always ready to back my
opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the
bird i ate is country bred

well then you've lost your fiver for it's town bred snapped
the salesman

it's nothing of the kind

i say it is

i don't believe it

d'you think you know more about fowls than i who have handled
them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that
went to the alpha were town bred

you'll never persuade me to believe that

will you bet then

it's merely taking your money for i know that i am right but
i'll have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be
obstinate

the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said
he

the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one laying them out together beneath the hanging
lamp

now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i
was out of geese but before i finish you'll find that there is
still one left in my shop you see this little book

well

that's the list of the folk from whom i buy d'you see well
then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers
after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger
now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a
list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just
read it out to me

mrs oakshott brixton road read holmes

quite so now turn that up in the ledger

holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs
oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier

now then what's the last entry

december nd twenty-four geese at s d

quite so there you are and underneath

sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s

what have you to say now

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from
his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the
air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off
he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty noiseless
fashion which was peculiar to him

when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un
protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet
said he i daresay that if i had put pounds down in front of
him that man would not have given me such complete information
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our
quest and the only point which remains to be determined is
whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott to-night or
whether we should reserve it for to-morrow it is clear from what
that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
who are anxious about the matter and i should 

his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a
little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while
breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was
shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure

i've had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you
were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more
with your silly talk i'll set the dog at you you bring mrs
oakshott here and i'll answer her but what have you to do with
it did i buy the geese off you

no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little
man

well then ask mrs oakshott for it

she told me to ask you

well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care i've had
enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and
the inquirer flitted away into the darkness

ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes
come with me and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who
lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook
the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang
round and i could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
colour had been driven from his face

who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering
voice

you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now
i think that i could be of assistance to you

you who are you how could you know anything of the matter

my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other
people don't know

but you can know nothing of this

excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to
trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton
road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr
windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr
henry baker is a member

oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried
the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers
i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter

sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing in that
case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
wind-swept market-place said he but pray tell me before we
go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting

the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he
answered with a sidelong glance

no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always
awkward doing business with an alias

a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then
said he my real name is james ryder

precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray
step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you
everything which you would wish to know

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened half-hopeful eyes as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe
then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in
the sitting-room at baker street nothing had been said during
our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and
the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous
tension within him

here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room
the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold
mr ryder pray take the basket-chair i will just put on my
slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then
you want to know what became of those geese

yes sir

or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in
which you were interested white with a black bar across the
tail

ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell
me where it went to

it came here

here

yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i don't wonder that
you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was
dead the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen
i have it here in my museum

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold
brilliant many-pointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a
drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it

the game's up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or
you'll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair
watson he's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little
more human what a shrimp it is to be sure

for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring
with frightened eyes at his accuser

i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i
could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me
still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the
countess of morcar's

it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a
crackling voice

i see her ladyship's waiting-maid well the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has
been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous
in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the
making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man
horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter
before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
what did you do then you made some small job in my lady's
room you and your confederate cusack and you managed that he
should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled
the jewel-case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man
arrested you then 

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion's knees for god's sake have mercy he shrieked
think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i
never went wrong before i never will again i swear it i'll
swear it on a bible oh don't bring it into court for christ's
sake don't

get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well
to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this
poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing

i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the
charge against him will break down

hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account
of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came
the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies
your only hope of safety

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you
it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been
arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment
the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe
i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sister's
house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton
road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there
every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective
and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down
my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me
what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i
had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went
into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
be best to do

i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and
has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met
me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they
could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to
me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind
to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my
confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money
but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had
gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be
seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly
an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the
best detective that ever lived

my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the
pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she
was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in
it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in
the yard and behind this i drove one of the birds a fine big
one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill
open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass
along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped
and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the
matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttered off among the others

whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she

well said i you said you'd give me one for christmas and i
was feeling which was the fattest

oh says she we've set yours aside for you jem's bird we
call it it's the big white one over yonder there's twenty-six
of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen
for the market

thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you
i'd rather have that one i was handling just now

the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we
fattened it expressly for you

never mind i'll have the other and i'll take it now said i

oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it
you want then

that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the
flock

oh very well kill it and take it with you

well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird
all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was
a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed
until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my
heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i
knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird
rushed back to my sister's and hurried into the back yard there
was not a bird to be seen there

where are they all maggie i cried

gone to the dealer's jem

which dealer's

breckinridge of covent garden

but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same
as the one i chose

yes jem there were two barred-tailed ones and i could never
tell them apart

well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my
feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the
lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they
had gone you heard him yourselves to-night well he has always
answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad
sometimes i think that i am myself and now and now i am myself
a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which
i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into
convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands

there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and
by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger-tips upon the
edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door

get out said he

what sir oh heaven bless you

no more words get out

and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon
the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running
footfalls from the street

after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his
clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their
deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing
but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must
collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just
possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong
again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and
you make him a gaol-bird for life besides it is the season of
forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and
whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you
will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin
another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief
feature



viii the adventure of the speckled band

on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i
have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number
merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did
rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation
which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which
presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occurred in the early days of my
association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them
upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the
time from which i have only been freed during the last month by
the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it
is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i
have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even
more terrible than the truth

it was early in april in the year that i woke one morning to
find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my
bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the
mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven i
blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little
resentment for i was myself regular in my habits

very sorry to knock you up watson said he but it's the
common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she
retorted upon me and i on you

what is it then a fire

no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a
considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she
is waiting now in the sitting-room now when young ladies wander
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock
sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is
something very pressing which they have to communicate should it
prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to
follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should
call you and give you the chance

my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything

i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his
professional investigations and in admiring the rapid
deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a
logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room a
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in
the window rose as we entered

good-morning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock
holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am
glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the
fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot
coffee for i observe that you are shivering

it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low
voice changing her seat as requested

what then

it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as
she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless
frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features
and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot
with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard
sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick
all-comprehensive glances

you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and
patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no
doubt you have come in by train this morning i see

you know me then

no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had
a good drive in a dog-cart along heavy roads before you reached
the station

the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion

there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left
arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you
sit on the left-hand side of the driver

whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said
she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at
twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i
can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues
i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me
and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you
mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you
helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had
your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me
too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be
married with the control of my own income and then at least you
shall not find me ungrateful

holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small
case-book which he consulted

farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was
concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time
watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote
the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to
reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty
to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which
suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us
everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter

alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to
another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to
look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it
as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have
heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold
wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid
the dangers which encompass me

i am all attention madam

my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who
is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in
england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of
surrey

holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he

the family was at one time among the richest in england and the
estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north
and hampshire in the west in the last century however four
successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition
and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground
and the two-hundred-year-old house which is itself crushed under
a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence
there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but
his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to
the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which
enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta
where by his professional skill and his force of character he
established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused
by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he
beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man

when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner
the young widow of major-general stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old
at the time of my mother's re-marriage she had a considerable
sum of money not less than pounds a year and this she
bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him
with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return
to england my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a
railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us
to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the
money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and
there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness

but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of
stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in
his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family and in my stepfather's case it had i believe been
intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of
disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the
police-court until at last he became the terror of the village
and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of
immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger

last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i
could gather together that i was able to avert another public
exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies
and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate
and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents
wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a
passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a
correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon
which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master

you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i
had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with
us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was
but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already
begun to whiten even as mine has

your sister is dead then

she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish
to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i
have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own
age and position we had however an aunt my mother's maiden
sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we
were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there
a half-pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my
stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of
the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event
occurred which has deprived me of my only companion

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his
lids now and glanced across at his visitor

pray be precise as to details said he

it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful
time is seared into my memory the manor-house is as i have
already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting-rooms
being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms
the first is dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third
my own there is no communication between them but they all open
out into the same corridor do i make myself plain

perfectly so

the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that
fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we
knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled
by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom
to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where
she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at
eleven o'clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door
and looked back

tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle
in the dead of the night

never said i

i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in
your sleep

certainly not but why

because during the last few nights i have always about three
in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper
and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came from perhaps
from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would
just ask you whether you had heard it

no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the
plantation

very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you
did not hear it also

ah but i sleep more heavily than you

well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled
back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her
key turn in the lock

indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock
yourselves in at night

always

and why

i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were
locked

quite so pray proceed with your statement

i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending
misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect
were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind
was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale
there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew
that it was my sister's voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a
shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door
i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and
a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had
fallen as i ran down the passage my sister's door was unlocked
and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it
horror-stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by
the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the
opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for
help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground
she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were
dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not
recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was
the band the speckled band there was something else which she
would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the
air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion
seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for
my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown when he reached my sister's side she was
unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for
she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister

one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound could you swear to it

that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is
my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of
the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have
been deceived

was your sister dressed

no she was in her night-dress in her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match and in her left a match-box

showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did
the coroner come to

he investigated the case with great care for dr roylott's
conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable
to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that
the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows
were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded
and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was
also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is
wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain
therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
besides there were no marks of any violence upon her

how about poison

the doctors examined her for it but without success

what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then

it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock
though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine

were there gipsies in the plantation at the time

yes there are nearly always some there

ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a
speckled band

sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not
know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used

holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied

these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your
narrative

two years have passed since then and my life has been until
lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend
whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask
my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the
second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my
stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to
be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs
were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom
wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the
chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in
which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last
night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i
suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the
lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to
go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was
daylight i slipped down got a dog-cart at the crown inn which
is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on
this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
advice

you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me
all

yes all

miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather

why what do you mean

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee five little
livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed
upon the white wrist

you have been cruelly used said holmes

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he
is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own
strength

there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin
upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire

this is a very deep business he said at last there are a
thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide
upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if
we were to come to stoke moran to-day would it be possible for
us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
stepfather

as it happens he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
most important business it is probable that he will be away all
day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a
housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily
get her out of the way

excellent you are not averse to this trip watson

by no means

then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself

i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am
in town but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train so as to
be there in time for your coming

and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some
small business matters to attend to will you not wait and
breakfast

no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have
confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you
again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glided from the room

and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes
leaning back in his chair

it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business

dark enough and sinister enough

yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable
then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
mysterious end

what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the
very peculiar words of the dying woman

i cannot think

when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of
a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor
the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage the dying
allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner
heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of
those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
place i think that there is good ground to think that the
mystery may be cleared along those lines

but what then did the gipsies do

i cannot imagine

i see many objections to any such theory

and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going
to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are
fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of
the devil

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had
framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar
mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a
black top-hat a long frock-coat and a pair of high gaiters
with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his
hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his
breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face
seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and
marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other
of us while his deep-set bile-shot eyes and his high thin
fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
bird of prey

which of you is holmes asked this apparition

my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my
companion quietly

i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran

indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat

i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i
have traced her what has she been saying to you

it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes

what has she been saying to you screamed the old man
furiously

but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my
companion imperturbably

ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step
forward and shaking his hunting-crop i know you you scoundrel
i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler

my friend smiled

holmes the busybody

his smile broadened

holmes the scotland yard jack-in-office

holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most
entertaining said he when you go out close the door for
there is a decided draught

i will go when i have said my say don't you dare to meddle with
my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her
i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped
swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with
his huge brown hands

see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and
hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
room

he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am
not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him
that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke
he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort
straightened it out again

fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation
however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now
watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk
down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may
help us in this matter


it was nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his
excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled
over with notes and figures

i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to
determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the
present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the
total income which at the time of the wife's death was little
short of pounds is now through the fall in agricultural
prices not more than pounds each daughter can claim an
income of pounds in case of marriage it is evident
therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have
had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to
a very serious extent my morning's work has not been wasted
since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson
this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is
aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you
are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be
very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
pocket an eley's no is an excellent argument with gentlemen
who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth-brush
are i think all that we need

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a
perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant
smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange
contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in
the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over
his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the
deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the
shoulder and pointed over the meadows

look there said he

a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the
branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
very old mansion

stoke moran said he

yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked
the driver

there is some building going on there said holmes that is
where we are going

there's the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of
roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the
house you'll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by
the foot-path over the fields there it is where the lady is
walking

and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading
his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest

we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way
to leatherhead

i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile
that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or
on some definite business it may stop his gossip
good-afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as
our word

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for
you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned
out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely
that he will be back before evening

we have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance
said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had
occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened

good heavens she cried he has followed me then

so it appears

he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what
will he say when he returns

he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone
more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself
up from him to-night if he is violent we shall take you away to
your aunt's at harrow now we must make the best use of our
time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
examine

the building was of grey lichen-blotched stone with a high
central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab
thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were
broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly
caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little
better repair but the right-hand block was comparatively modern
and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up
from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the
stone-work had been broken into but there were no signs of any
workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and
down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
outsides of the windows

this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep
the centre one to your sister's and the one next to the main
building to dr roylott's chamber

exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one

pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does
not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
wall

there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from
my room

ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow
wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there
are windows in it of course

yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass
through

as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were
unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness
to go into your room and bar your shutters

miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination
through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the
shutter open but without success there was no slit through
which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his
lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built
firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his
chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some
difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were
bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
the matter

a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third
chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss
stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her
fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a
gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country-houses a
brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow
white-counterpaned bed in another and a dressing-table on the
left-hand side of the window these articles with two small
wicker-work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save
for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and
the panelling of the walls were of brown worm-eaten oak so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down
taking in every detail of the apartment

where does that bell communicate with he asked at last
pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed the
tassel actually lying upon the pillow

it goes to the housekeeper's room

it looks newer than the other things

yes it was only put there a couple of years ago

your sister asked for it i suppose

no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves

indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to
this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining
minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with
the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the
bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug

why it's a dummy said he

won't it ring

no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting
you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
the little opening for the ventilator is

how very absurd i never noticed that before

very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are
one or two very singular points about this room for example
what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
room when with the same trouble he might have communicated
with the outside air

that is also quite modern said the lady

done about the same time as the bell-rope remarked holmes

yes there were several little changes carried out about that
time

they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy
bell-ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your
permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into
the inner apartment

dr grimesby roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter but was as plainly furnished a camp-bed a small
wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an
armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a
round table and a large iron safe were the principal things
which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each
and all of them with the keenest interest

what's in here he asked tapping the safe

my stepfather's business papers

oh you have seen inside then

only once some years ago i remember that it was full of
papers

there isn't a cat in it for example

no what a strange idea

well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which
stood on the top of it

no we don't keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon

ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i
daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
of it with the greatest attention

thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting
his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting

the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself
and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord

what do you make of that watson

it's a common enough lash but i don't know why it should be
tied

that is not quite so common is it ah me it's a wicked world
and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and
with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn

i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we
had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss
stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie

it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect

i shall most certainly do so

the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may
depend upon your compliance

i assure you that i am in your hands

in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in
your room

both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment

yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the
village inn over there

yes that is the crown

very good your windows would be visible from there

certainly

you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a
headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him
retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window
undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then
withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in
spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night

oh yes easily

the rest you will leave in our hands

but what will you do

we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate
the cause of this noise which has disturbed you

i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve

perhaps i have

then for pity's sake tell me what was the cause of my sister's
death

i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak

you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and
if she died from some sudden fright

no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more
tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if
dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
good-bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you
you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
that threaten you

sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and
from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and
of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw
dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside
the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some
slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few
minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms

do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the
gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you
to-night there is a distinct element of danger

can i be of assistance

your presence might be invaluable

then i shall certainly come

it is very kind of you

you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms
than was visible to me

no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine
that you saw all that i did

i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope and what purpose
that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine

you saw the ventilator too

yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a
rat could hardly pass through

i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
stoke moran

my dear holmes

oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her
sister could smell dr roylott's cigar now of course that
suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been
remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry i deduced a ventilator

but what harm can there be in that

well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a
ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the
bed dies does not that strike you

i cannot as yet see any connection

did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed

no

it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened
like that before

i cannot say that i have

the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may
call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull

holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
crime

subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong
he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession
this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall
be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough
before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet
pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
cheerful


about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours
passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of
eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us

that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it
comes from the middle window

as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord
explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a
moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing
in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for
unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way
among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about
to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness

my god i whispered did you see it

holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like
a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low
laugh and put his lips to my ear

it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon

i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there
was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when
after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i
found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed
the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes
round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then
creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered
into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to
distinguish the words

the least sound would be fatal to our plans

i nodded to show that i had heard

we must sit without light he would see it through the
ventilator

i nodded again

do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your
pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of
the bed and you in that chair

i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table

holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon
the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the
stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left
in darkness

how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a
sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my
companion sat open-eyed within a few feet of me in the same
state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut
off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness

from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird and once at
our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that
the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of
an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and
one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for
whatever might befall

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was
succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal
someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern i heard a gentle
sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the
smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audible a very gentle
soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping
continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes
sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull

you see it watson he yelled you see it

but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i
heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my
weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face
was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had
ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder
and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the
village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i
stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it
had died away into the silence from which it rose

what can it mean i gasped

it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps
after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will
enter dr roylott's room

with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his
heels with the cocked pistol in my hand

it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant
beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott
clad in a long grey dressing-gown his bare ankles protruding
beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his
eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the
ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with
brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his
head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion

the band the speckled band whispered holmes

i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began
to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent

it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in
india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence
does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls
into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this
creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to
some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
happened

as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
its horrid perch and carrying it at arm's length threw it into
the iron safe which he closed upon it

such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of
stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a
narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed
her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn
of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back
next day

i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of
the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to
explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an
entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly
reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me
that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
come either from the window or the door my attention was
speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this
ventilator and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed the
discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to
the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me
and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i
was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of
poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such
a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be
an advantage it would be a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who could
distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the
whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning
light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by
the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the
occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but
sooner or later she must fall a victim

i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his
room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary
in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the
safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to
finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic
clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in
order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss
as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the
light and attacked it

with the result of driving it through the ventilator

and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person
it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr
grimesby roylott's death and i cannot say that it is likely to
weigh very heavily upon my conscience



ix the adventure of the engineer's thumb

of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr
sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy
there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his
notice that of mr hatherley's thumb and that of colonel
warburton's madness of these the latter may have afforded a
finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story
has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but
like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when
set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly
served to weaken the effect

it was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the
events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker
street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come
and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i
happened to live at no very great distance from paddington
station i got a few patients from among the officials one of
these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was
never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence

one morning at a little before seven o'clock i was awakened by
the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room i
dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my
old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door
tightly behind him

i've got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his
shoulder he's all right

what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creature which he had caged up in my room

it's a new patient he whispered i thought i'd bring him
round myself then he couldn't slip away there he is all safe
and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the
same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even
giving me time to thank him

i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of
his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all
over with bloodstains he was young not more than
five-and-twenty i should say with a strong masculine face but
he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his
strength of mind to control

i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i
have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by
train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i
might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon
the side-table

i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic
engineer a victoria street rd floor that was the name
style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have
kept you waiting said i sitting down in my library-chair you
are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself
a monotonous occupation

oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and
laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note
leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh

stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out
some water from a caraffe

it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very
weary and pale-looking

i have been making a fool of myself he gasped

not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water
and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks

that's better said he and now doctor perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even
my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four
protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the
thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots

good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have
bled considerably

yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must
have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that
it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig

excellent you should have been a surgeon

it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own
province

this has been done said i examining the wound by a very
heavy and sharp instrument

a thing like a cleaver said he

an accident i presume

by no means

what a murderous attack

very murderous indeed

you horrify me

i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered
it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back
without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time

how is that i asked when i had finished

capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man
i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through

perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently
trying to your nerves

oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police
but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they
believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and
even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so
vague that it is a question whether justice will be done

ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem
which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the
official police

oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i
should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of
course i must use the official police as well would you give me
an introduction to him

i'll do better i'll take you round to him myself

i should be immensely obliged to you

we'll call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to
have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it

yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story

then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an
instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my
wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my
new acquaintance to baker street

sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his
sitting-room in his dressing-gown reading the agony column of the
times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion
ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal
when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach

it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one
mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant

thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has
completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavy-lidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat
opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story
which our visitor detailed to us

you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor
residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a
hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my
work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner 
matheson the well-known firm of greenwich two years ago
having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of
money through my poor father's death i determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria
street

i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so
during two years i have had three consultations and one small
job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me my gross takings amount to pounds s every day from
nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my
little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to
believe that i should never have any practice at all

yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the
office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with
the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at
his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle
size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have
ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his
step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly
dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than
thirty

mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent
you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man
who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
and capable of preserving a secret

i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character

well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just
at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both
an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london

that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if
i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter
that you wished to speak to me

undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to
the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute
secrecy is quite essential absolute secrecy you understand and
of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family

if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so

he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye

do you promise then said he at last

yes i promise

absolute and complete silence before during and after no
reference to the matter at all either in word or writing

i have already given you my word

very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was
empty

that's all right said he coming back i know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master's affairs now we can talk
in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look

a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience

i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time
is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the
words came to my lips

how would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you he asked

most admirably

i say a night's work but an hour's would be nearer the mark i
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as
that

the work appears to be light and the pay munificent

precisely so we shall want you to come to-night by the last
train

where to

to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders
of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a
train from paddington which would bring you there at about


very good

i shall come down in a carriage to meet you

there is a drive then

yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good
seven miles from eyford station

then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there
would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop
the night

yes we could easily give you a shake-down

that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient
hour

we have judged it best that you should come late it is to
recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a
young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the
very heads of your profession still of course if you would
like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do
so

i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they
would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to
accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to
understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
do

quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i
have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from
eavesdroppers

entirely

then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that
fuller's-earth is a valuable product and that it is only found
in one or two places in england

i have heard so

some little time ago i bought a small place a very small
place within ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to
discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a
comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and left both of them
however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were
absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as a gold-mine naturally it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value
but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i
took a few of my friends into the secret however and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been
doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we
erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already
explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the
subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts
came out it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you
promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
going to eyford to-night i hope that i make it all plain

i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not
quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
in excavating fuller's-earth which as i understand is dug out
like gravel from a pit

ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress
the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing
what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully
into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i
trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at
eyford at 

i shall certainly be there

and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long
questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank
grasp he hurried from the room

well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very
much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was
glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked
had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that
this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face
and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
me and i could not think that his explanation of the
fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell
anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate
a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue

at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station
however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i
reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock i was the
only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the
platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed
out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door
of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either
side tapped on the wood-work and away we went as fast as the
horse could go

one horse interjected holmes

yes only one

did you observe the colour

yes i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the
carriage it was a chestnut

tired-looking or fresh

oh fresh and glossy

thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue
your most interesting statement

away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel
lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i
should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the
time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat
at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than
once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me
with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now
and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the
conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang
out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch
which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of
the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that
i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us
and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away

it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath
suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a
long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew
broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she
held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us
i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich
material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
though asking a question and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered
something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the
lamp in his hand

perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a
quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the
centre on which several german books were scattered colonel
stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and
vanished into the darkness

i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my
ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises
on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked
across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of
the country-side but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded
across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise
everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me who were these german people and what were
they doing living in this strange out-of-the-way place and
where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was
all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no
idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns
were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded
after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness
that we were in the country i paced up and down the room
humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
that i was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee

suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman
was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind
her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few
whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back
like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her

i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to
speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no
good for you to do

but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i
cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine

it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass
through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled
and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love
of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too
late

but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i
thought of my fifty-guinea fee of my wearisome journey and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to
go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried
out my commission and without the payment which was my due this
woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout
bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i
cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention
of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up
her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come

the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson

this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the
way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just
now i fear that you have felt the draught

on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i
felt the room to be a little close

he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had
better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i
will take you up to see the machine

i had better put my hat on i suppose

oh no it is in the house

what you dig fuller's-earth in the house

no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that
all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it

we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the
fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house
with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little
low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no
signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster
was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in
green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an
air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the
lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon
my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at
least a fellow-countryman

colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which
he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside
and the colonel ushered me in

we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and
it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns
of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine
goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working
of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right

i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very
thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of
exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and
pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed
a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an
examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause
of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who
followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i
had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity
it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a
large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a
crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a
muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me

what are you doing there he asked

i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
that which he had told me i was admiring your fuller's-earth
said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to
your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used

the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of
my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes

very well said he you shall know all about the machine he
took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key
in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it
was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out

and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my
heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish
of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp
still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining
the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than
myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and
dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let
me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with
my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my
face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to
think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and
yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand
erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
back to my heart

i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the
walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw
a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for
an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
which led away from death the next instant i threw myself
through and lay half-fainting upon the other side the panel had
closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me
how narrow had been my escape

i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and
i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor
while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand
while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend
whose warning i had so foolishly rejected

come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a
moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste
the so-precious time but come

this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to
my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we
were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about
her like one who is at her wit's end then she threw open a door
which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly

it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be
that you can jump it

as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark
rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
butcher's cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom
flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and
wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be
more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i
hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were ill-used
then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance
the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round
him and tried to hold him back

fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise
after the last time you said it should not be again he will be
silent oh he will be silent

you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from
her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me
pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the
window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and
was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was
conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the
garden below

i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i
understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly
however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me
i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and
then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and
that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my
ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the
rose-bushes

how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been
a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was
breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with
dew and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
particulars of my night's adventure and i sprang to my feet with
the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but
to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house
nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a
long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the
very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed
during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream

half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning
train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the
same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i
arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel
lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a
carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was
there a police-station anywhere near there was one about three
miles off

it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined
to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the
police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first
to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do
exactly what you advise

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
placed his cuttings

here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it
appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this
lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged
twenty-six a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten
o'clock at night and has not been heard of since was
dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that
the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy

good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the
girl said

undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game like those out-and-out
pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well
every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
eyford

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together bound from reading to the little berkshire village
there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector
bradstreet of scotland yard a plain-clothes man and myself
bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford
for its centre

there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of
ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere
near that line you said ten miles i think sir

it was an hour's good drive

and you think that they brought you back all that way when you
were unconscious

they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhere

what i cannot understand said i is why they should have
spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden
perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties

i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face
in my life

oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i
have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found

i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly

really now cried the inspector you have formed your
opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is
south for the country is more deserted there

and i say east said my patient

i am for west remarked the plain-clothes man there are
several quiet little villages up there

and i am for north said i because there are no hills there
and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
any

come cried the inspector laughing it's a very pretty
diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do
you give your casting vote to

you are all wrong

but we can't all be

oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the
centre of the circle this is where we shall find them

but the twelve-mile drive gasped hatherley

six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the
horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads

indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet
thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang

none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale
and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
place of silver

we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work
said the inspector they have been turning out half-crowns by
the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could
get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that
showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this
lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough

but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into
eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape

a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way

yes sir said the station-master

when did it break out

i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse
and the whole place is in a blaze

whose house is it

dr becher's

tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very
thin with a long sharp nose

the station-master laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an
englishman and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
better-lined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him
a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as
if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm

the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low
hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under

that's it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is
the gravel-drive and there are the rose-bushes where i lay that
second window is the one that i jumped from

well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon
them there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which
when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls
though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are
a good hundred miles off by now

and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the
sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a
peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within and still more so by discovering a
newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and
they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in
and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an out-house but no coins were to be found which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a
very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two
persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the
silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his
companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
of the way of danger

well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i
have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee and what
have i gained

experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of
value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the
reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
existence



x the adventure of the noble bachelor

the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have
long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have
eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the
gossips away from this four-year-old drama as i have reason to
believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to
the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a
considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
this remarkable episode

it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i
was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and
the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as
a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
with my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another i had
surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and
lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
noble correspondent could be

here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered
your morning letters if i remember right were from a
fish-monger and a tide-waiter

yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he
answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more
interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents

oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all

not social then

no distinctly professional

and from a noble client

one of the highest in england

my dear fellow i congratulate you

i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
case it is just possible however that that also may not be
wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the
papers diligently of late have you not

it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in
the corner i have had nothing else to do

it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i
read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the
latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his
wedding

oh yes with the deepest interest

that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord
st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn
over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter
this is what he says

my dear mr sherlock holmes lord backwater tells me that i
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i
have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is
acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance i will call at four o'clock in
the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that
time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of
paramount importance yours faithfully st simon

it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen
and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes
as he folded up the epistle

he says four o'clock it is three now he will be here in an
hour

then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon
the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client
is he picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham
de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms
azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 
he's forty-one years of age which is mature for marriage was
under-secretary for the colonies in a late administration the
duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs
they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on
the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in
all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something
more solid

i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i
for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as
remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew
that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
intrusion of other matters

oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square
furniture van that is quite cleared up now though indeed it
was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your
newspaper selections

here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal
column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks
back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if
rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert
st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty
doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san
francisco cal usa that is all

terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long
thin legs towards the fire

there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a
call for protection in the marriage market for the present
free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
product one by one the management of the noble houses of great
britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself
for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows has
now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty
doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss
doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child
and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the
future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has
been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years
and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small
estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress
is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a
british peeress

anything else asked holmes yawning

oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post
to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it
would be at st george's hanover square that only half a dozen
intimate friends would be invited and that the party would
return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been
taken by mr aloysius doran two days later that is on
wednesday last there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord
backwater's place near petersfield those are all the notices
which appeared before the disappearance of the bride

before the what asked holmes with a start

the vanishing of the lady

when did she vanish then

at the wedding breakfast

indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite
dramatic in fact

yes it struck me as being a little out of the common

they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during
the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
as this pray let me have the details

i warn you that they are very incomplete

perhaps we may make them less so

such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a
morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is

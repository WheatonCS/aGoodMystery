speak trees have no ears

but the red hurons are not deaf and counsel that is fit for the great
men of a nation would make the young warriors drunk if magua will not
listen the officer of the king knows how to be silent

the savage spoke carelessly to his comrades who were busied after
their awkward manner in preparing the horses for the reception of the
sisters and moved a little to one side whither by a cautious gesture
he induced heyward to follow

now speak he said if the words are such as magua should hear

le renard subtil has proved himself worthy of the honorable name given
to him by his canada fathers commenced heyward i see his wisdom
and all that he has done for us and shall remember it when the hour to
reward him arrives yes renard has proved that he is not only a great
chief in council but one who knows how to deceive his enemies

what has renard done coldly demanded the indian

what has he not seen that the woods were filled with outlying parties
of the enemies and that the serpent could not steal through them
without being seen then did he not lose his path to blind the eyes of
the hurons did he not pretend to go back to his tribe who had treated
him ill and driven him from their wigwams like a dog and when he saw
what he wished to do did we not aid him by making a false face that
the hurons might think the white man believed that his friend was his
enemy is not all this true and when le subtil had shut the eyes and
stopped the ears of his nation by his wisdom did they not forget that
they had once done him wrong and forced him to flee to the mohawks
and did they not leave him on the south side of the river with their
prisoners while they have gone foolishly on the north does not renard
mean to turn like a fox on his footsteps and to carry to the rich and
gray-headed scotchman his daughters yes magua i see it all and i
have already been thinking how so much wisdom and honesty should be
repaid first the chief of william henry will give as a great chief
should for such a service the medal of magua will no longer be of tin
but of beaten gold his horn will run over with powder dollars will be
as plenty in his pouch as pebbles on the shore of horican and the deer
will lick his hand for they will know it to be vain to fly from
the rifle he will carry as for myself i know not how to exceed the
gratitude of the scotchman but i yes i will 

 it has long been a practice with the whites to conciliate
 the important men of the indians by presenting medals which
 are worn in the place of their own rude ornaments those
 given by the english generally bear the impression of the
 reigning king and those given by the americans that of the
 president

what will the young chief who comes from toward the sun give
demanded the huron observing that heyward hesitated in his desire to
end the enumeration of benefits with that which might form the climax of
an indian's wishes

he will make the fire-water from the islands in the salt lake flow
before the wigwam of magua until the heart of the indian shall be
lighter than the feathers of the humming-bird and his breath sweeter
than the wild honeysuckle

le renard had listened gravely as heyward slowly proceeded in this
subtle speech when the young man mentioned the artifice he supposed
the indian to have practised on his own nation the countenance of
the listener was veiled in an expression of cautious gravity at the
allusion to the injury which duncan affected to believe had driven
the huron from his native tribe a gleam of such ungovernable ferocity
flashed from the other's eyes as induced the adventurous speaker to
believe he had struck the proper chord and by the time he reached
the part where he so artfully blended the thirst of vengeance with the
desire of gain he had at least obtained a command of the deepest
attention of the savage the question put by le renard had been calm
and with all the dignity of an indian but it was quite apparent by the
thoughtful expression of the listener's countenance that the answer was
most cunningly devised the huron mused a few moments and then laying
his hand on the rude bandages of his wounded shoulder he said with
some energy

do friends make such marks

would la longue carbine cut one so slight on an enemy

do the delawares crawl upon those they love like snakes twisting
themselves to strike

would le gros serpent have been heard by the ears of one he wished to
be deaf

does the white chief burn his powder in the faces of his brothers

does he ever miss his aim when seriously bent to kill returned
duncan smiling with well acted sincerity

another long and deliberate pause succeeded these sententious questions
and ready replies duncan saw that the indian hesitated in order to
complete his victory he was in the act of recommencing the enumeration
of the rewards when magua made an expressive gesture and said

enough le renard is a wise chief and what he does will be seen
go and keep the mouth shut when magua speaks it will be the time to
answer

heyward perceiving that the eyes of his companion were warily fastened
on the rest of the band fell back immediately in order to avoid
the appearance of any suspicious confederacy with their leader
magua approached the horses and affected to be well pleased with the
diligence and ingenuity of his comrades he then signed to heyward to
assist the sisters into the saddles for he seldom deigned to use the
english tongue unless urged by some motive of more than usual moment

there was no longer any plausible pretext for delay and duncan was
obliged however reluctantly to comply as he performed this office he
whispered his reviving hopes in the ears of the trembling females who
through dread of encountering the savage countenances of their captors
seldom raised their eyes from the ground the mare of david had been
taken with the followers of the large chief in consequence its owner
as well as duncan was compelled to journey on foot the latter did not
however so much regret this circumstance as it might enable him to
retard the speed of the party for he still turned his longing looks in
the direction of fort edward in the vain expectation of catching some
sound from that quarter of the forest which might denote the approach
of succor when all were prepared magua made the signal to proceed
advancing in front to lead the party in person next followed david who
was gradually coming to a true sense of his condition as the effects of
the wound became less and less apparent the sisters rode in his rear
with heyward at their side while the indians flanked the party and
brought up the close of the march with a caution that seemed never to
tire

in this manner they proceeded in uninterrupted silence except when
heyward addressed some solitary word of comfort to the females or david
gave vent to the moanings of his spirit in piteous exclamations which
he intended should express the humility of resignation their direction
lay toward the south and in a course nearly opposite to the road to
william henry notwithstanding this apparent adherence in magua to the
original determination of his conquerors heyward could not believe
his tempting bait was so soon forgotten and he knew the windings of an
indian's path too well to suppose that its apparent course led directly
to its object when artifice was at all necessary mile after mile was
however passed through the boundless woods in this painful manner
without any prospect of a termination to their journey heyward watched
the sun as he darted his meridian rays through the branches of the
trees and pined for the moment when the policy of magua should change
their route to one more favorable to his hopes sometimes he fancied the
wary savage despairing of passing the army of montcalm in safety
was holding his way toward a well-known border settlement where a
distinguished officer of the crown and a favored friend of the six
nations held his large possessions as well as his usual residence to
be delivered into the hands of sir william johnson was far preferable
to being led into the wilds of canada but in order to effect even the
former it would be necessary to traverse the forest for many weary
leagues each step of which was carrying him further from the scene of
the war and consequently from the post not only of honor but of
duty

cora alone remembered the parting injunctions of the scout and whenever
an opportunity offered she stretched forth her arm to bend aside the
twigs that met her hands but the vigilance of the indians rendered this
act of precaution both difficult and dangerous she was often defeated
in her purpose by encountering their watchful eyes when it became
necessary to feign an alarm she did not feel and occupy the limb by
some gesture of feminine apprehension once and once only was she
completely successful when she broke down the bough of a large sumach
and by a sudden thought let her glove fall at the same instant this
sign intended for those that might follow was observed by one of her
conductors who restored the glove broke the remaining branches of the
bush in such a manner that it appeared to proceed from the struggling of
some beast in its branches and then laid his hand on his tomahawk
with a look so significant that it put an effectual end to these stolen
memorials of their passage

as there were horses to leave the prints of their footsteps in both
bands of the indians this interruption cut off any probable hopes of
assistance being conveyed through the means of their trail

heyward would have ventured a remonstrance had there been anything
encouraging in the gloomy reserve of magua but the savage during all
this time seldom turned to look at his followers and never spoke with
the sun for his only guide or aided by such blind marks as are only
known to the sagacity of a native he held his way along the barrens
of pine through occasional little fertile vales across brooks and
rivulets and over undulating hills with the accuracy of instinct
and nearly with the directness of a bird he never seemed to hesitate
whether the path was hardly distinguishable whether it disappeared or
whether it lay beaten and plain before him made no sensible difference
in his speed or certainty it seemed as if fatigue could not affect him
whenever the eyes of the wearied travelers rose from the decayed leaves
over which they trod his dark form was to be seen glancing among the
stems of the trees in front his head immovably fastened in a forward
position with the light plume on his crest fluttering in a current of
air made solely by the swiftness of his own motion

but all this diligence and speed were not without an object after
crossing a low vale through which a gushing brook meandered he
suddenly ascended a hill so steep and difficult of ascent that the
sisters were compelled to alight in order to follow when the summit was
gained they found themselves on a level spot but thinly covered with
trees under one of which magua had thrown his dark form as if willing
and ready to seek that rest which was so much needed by the whole party




chapter 

 cursed be my tribe if i forgive him
 shylock

the indian had selected for this desirable purpose one of those steep
pyramidal hills which bear a strong resemblance to artificial mounds
and which so frequently occur in the valleys of america the one in
question was high and precipitous its top flattened as usual but with
one of its sides more than ordinarily irregular it possessed no other
apparent advantage for a resting place than in its elevation and form
which might render defense easy and surprise nearly impossible as
heyward however no longer expected that rescue which time and distance
now rendered so improbable he regarded these little peculiarities with
an eye devoid of interest devoting himself entirely to the comfort and
condolence of his feebler companions the narragansetts were suffered
to browse on the branches of the trees and shrubs that were thinly
scattered over the summit of the hill while the remains of their
provisions were spread under the shade of a beech that stretched its
horizontal limbs like a canopy above them

notwithstanding the swiftness of their flight one of the indians had
found an opportunity to strike a straggling fawn with an arrow and
had borne the more preferable fragments of the victim patiently on his
shoulders to the stopping place without any aid from the science of
cookery he was immediately employed in common with his fellows in
gorging himself with this digestible sustenance magua alone sat apart
without participating in the revolting meal and apparently buried in
the deepest thought

this abstinence so remarkable in an indian when he possessed the means
of satisfying hunger at length attracted the notice of heyward the
young man willingly believed that the huron deliberated on the most
eligible manner of eluding the vigilance of his associates with a view
to assist his plans by any suggestion of his own and to strengthen the
temptation he left the beech and straggled as if without an object
to the spot where le renard was seated

has not magua kept the sun in his face long enough to escape all danger
from the canadians he asked as though no longer doubtful of the
good intelligence established between them and will not the chief
of william henry be better pleased to see his daughters before another
night may have hardened his heart to their loss to make him less
liberal in his reward

do the pale faces love their children less in the morning than at
night asked the indian coldly

by no means returned heyward anxious to recall his error if he had
made one the white man may and does often forget the burial place of
his fathers he sometimes ceases to remember those he should love and
has promised to cherish but the affection of a parent for his child is
never permitted to die

and is the heart of the white-headed chief soft and will he think of
the babes that his squaws have given him he is hard on his warriors and
his eyes are made of stone

he is severe to the idle and wicked but to the sober and deserving
he is a leader both just and humane i have known many fond and tender
parents but never have i seen a man whose heart was softer toward his
child you have seen the gray-head in front of his warriors magua but
i have seen his eyes swimming in water when he spoke of those children
who are now in your power

heyward paused for he knew not how to construe the remarkable
expression that gleamed across the swarthy features of the attentive
indian at first it seemed as if the remembrance of the promised reward
grew vivid in his mind while he listened to the sources of parental
feeling which were to assure its possession but as duncan proceeded
the expression of joy became so fiercely malignant that it was
impossible not to apprehend it proceeded from some passion more sinister
than avarice

go said the huron suppressing the alarming exhibition in an
instant in a death-like calmness of countenance go to the dark-haired
daughter and say magua waits to speak the father will remember what
the child promises

duncan who interpreted this speech to express a wish for some
additional pledge that the promised gifts should not be withheld slowly
and reluctantly repaired to the place where the sisters were now resting
from their fatigue to communicate its purport to cora

you understand the nature of an indian's wishes he concluded as he
led her toward the place where she was expected and must be prodigal
of your offers of powder and blankets ardent spirits are however the
most prized by such as he nor would it be amiss to add some boon
from your own hand with that grace you so well know how to practise
remember cora that on your presence of mind and ingenuity even your
life as well as that of alice may in some measure depend

heyward and yours

mine is of little moment it is already sold to my king and is a prize
to be seized by any enemy who may possess the power i have no father
to expect me and but few friends to lament a fate which i have courted
with the insatiable longings of youth after distinction but hush we
approach the indian magua the lady with whom you wish to speak is
here

the indian rose slowly from his seat and stood for near a minute silent
and motionless he then signed with his hand for heyward to retire
saying coldly

when the huron talks to the women his tribe shut their ears

duncan still lingering as if refusing to comply cora said with a
calm smile

you hear heyward and delicacy at least should urge you to retire go
to alice and comfort her with our reviving prospects

she waited until he had departed and then turning to the native with
the dignity of her sex in her voice and manner she added what would
le renard say to the daughter of munro

listen said the indian laying his hand firmly upon her arm as if
willing to draw her utmost attention to his words a movement that cora
as firmly but quietly repulsed by extricating the limb from his grasp
magua was born a chief and a warrior among the red hurons of the lakes
he saw the suns of twenty summers make the snows of twenty winters run
off in the streams before he saw a pale face and he was happy then
his canada fathers came into the woods and taught him to drink the
fire-water and he became a rascal the hurons drove him from the graves
of his fathers as they would chase the hunted buffalo he ran down the
shores of the lakes and followed their outlet to the city of cannon
there he hunted and fished till the people chased him again through the
woods into the arms of his enemies the chief who was born a huron was
at last a warrior among the mohawks

something like this i had heard before said cora observing that he
paused to suppress those passions which began to burn with too bright a
flame as he recalled the recollection of his supposed injuries

was it the fault of le renard that his head was not made of rock who
gave him the fire-water who made him a villain twas the pale faces
the people of your own color

and am i answerable that thoughtless and unprincipled men exist whose
shades of countenance may resemble mine cora calmly demanded of the
excited savage

no magua is a man and not a fool such as you never open their lips
to the burning stream the great spirit has given you wisdom

what then have i do to or say in the matter of your misfortunes
not to say of your errors

listen repeated the indian resuming his earnest attitude when
his english and french fathers dug up the hatchet le renard struck the
war-post of the mohawks and went out against his own nation the pale
faces have driven the red-skins from their hunting grounds and now when
they fight a white man leads the way the old chief at horican your
father was the great captain of our war-party he said to the mohawks
do this and do that and he was minded he made a law that if an
indian swallowed the fire-water and came into the cloth wigwams of his
warriors it should not be forgotten magua foolishly opened his
mouth and the hot liquor led him into the cabin of munro what did the
gray-head let his daughter say

he forgot not his words and did justice by punishing the offender
said the undaunted daughter

justice repeated the indian casting an oblique glance of the most
ferocious expression at her unyielding countenance is it justice to
make evil and then punish for it magua was not himself it was the
fire-water that spoke and acted for him but munro did believe it the
huron chief was tied up before all the pale-faced warriors and whipped
like a dog

cora remained silent for she knew not how to palliate this imprudent
severity on the part of her father in a manner to suit the comprehension
of an indian

see continued magua tearing aside the slight calico that very
imperfectly concealed his painted breast here are scars given by
knives and bullets of these a warrior may boast before his nation but
the gray-head has left marks on the back of the huron chief that he must
hide like a squaw under this painted cloth of the whites

i had thought resumed cora that an indian warrior was patient and
that his spirit felt not and knew not the pain his body suffered

when the chippewas tied magua to the stake and cut this gash said
the other laying his finger on a deep scar the huron laughed in their
faces and told them women struck so light his spirit was then in the
clouds but when he felt the blows of munro his spirit lay under the
birch the spirit of a huron is never drunk it remembers forever

but it may be appeased if my father has done you this injustice show
him how an indian can forgive an injury and take back his daughters
you have heard from major heyward 

magua shook his head forbidding the repetition of offers he so much
despised

what would you have continued cora after a most painful pause
while the conviction forced itself on her mind that the too sanguine and
generous duncan had been cruelly deceived by the cunning of the savage

what a huron loves good for good bad for bad

you would then revenge the injury inflicted by munro on his helpless
daughters would it not be more like a man to go before his face and
take the satisfaction of a warrior

the arms of the pale faces are long and their knives sharp returned
the savage with a malignant laugh why should le renard go among the
muskets of his warriors when he holds the spirit of the gray-head in
his hand

name your intention magua said cora struggling with herself to
speak with steady calmness is it to lead us prisoners to the woods or
do you contemplate even some greater evil is there no reward no means
of palliating the injury and of softening your heart at least release
my gentle sister and pour out all your malice on me purchase wealth
by her safety and satisfy your revenge with a single victim the loss
of both his daughters might bring the aged man to his grave and where
would then be the satisfaction of le renard

listen said the indian again the light eyes can go back to the
horican and tell the old chief what has been done if the dark-haired
woman will swear by the great spirit of her fathers to tell no lie

what must i promise demanded cora still maintaining a secret
ascendancy over the fierce native by the collected and feminine dignity
of her presence

when magua left his people his wife was given to another chief he has
now made friends with the hurons and will go back to the graves of his
tribe on the shores of the great lake let the daughter of the english
chief follow and live in his wigwam forever

however revolting a proposal of such a character might prove to
cora she retained notwithstanding her powerful disgust sufficient
self-command to reply without betraying the weakness

and what pleasure would magua find in sharing his cabin with a wife he
did not love one who would be of a nation and color different from his
own it would be better to take the gold of munro and buy the heart of
some huron maid with his gifts

the indian made no reply for near a minute but bent his fierce looks
on the countenance of cora in such wavering glances that her eyes
sank with shame under an impression that for the first time they had
encountered an expression that no chaste female might endure while she
was shrinking within herself in dread of having her ears wounded by
some proposal still more shocking than the last the voice of magua
answered in its tones of deepest malignancy

when the blows scorched the back of the huron he would know where to
find a woman to feel the smart the daughter of munro would draw his
water hoe his corn and cook his venison the body of the gray-head
would sleep among his cannon but his heart would lie within reach of
the knife of le subtil

monster well dost thou deserve thy treacherous name cried cora in
an ungovernable burst of filial indignation none but a fiend could
meditate such a vengeance but thou overratest thy power you shall find
it is in truth the heart of munro you hold and that it will defy your
utmost malice

the indian answered this bold defiance by a ghastly smile that showed
an unaltered purpose while he motioned her away as if to close the
conference forever cora already regretting her precipitation was
obliged to comply for magua instantly left the spot and approached his
gluttonous comrades heyward flew to the side of the agitated female
and demanded the result of a dialogue that he had watched at a distance
with so much interest but unwilling to alarm the fears of alice she
evaded a direct reply betraying only by her anxious looks fastened on
the slightest movements of her captors to the reiterated and earnest
questions of her sister concerning their probable destination she
made no other answer than by pointing toward the dark group with an
agitation she could not control and murmuring as she folded alice to
her bosom

there there read our fortunes in their faces we shall see we shall
see

the action and the choked utterance of cora spoke more impressively
than any words and quickly drew the attention of her companions on that
spot where her own was riveted with an intenseness that nothing but the
importance of the stake could create

when magua reached the cluster of lolling savages who gorged with
their disgusting meal lay stretched on the earth in brutal indulgence
he commenced speaking with the dignity of an indian chief the first
syllables he uttered had the effect to cause his listeners to raise
themselves in attitudes of respectful attention as the huron used
his native language the prisoners notwithstanding the caution of the
natives had kept them within the swing of their tomahawks could only
conjecture the substance of his harangue from the nature of those
significant gestures with which an indian always illustrates his
eloquence

at first the language as well as the action of magua appeared calm
and deliberative when he had succeeded in sufficiently awakening
the attention of his comrades heyward fancied by his pointing so
frequently toward the direction of the great lakes that he spoke of the
land of their fathers and of their distant tribe frequent indications
of applause escaped the listeners who as they uttered the expressive
hugh looked at each other in commendation of the speaker le renard
was too skillful to neglect his advantage he now spoke of the long and
painful route by which they had left those spacious grounds and happy
villages to come and battle against the enemies of their canadian
fathers he enumerated the warriors of the party their several merits
their frequent services to the nation their wounds and the number of
the scalps they had taken whenever he alluded to any present and the
subtle indian neglected none the dark countenance of the flattered
individual gleamed with exultation nor did he even hesitate to assert
the truth of the words by gestures of applause and confirmation then
the voice of the speaker fell and lost the loud animated tones of
triumph with which he had enumerated their deeds of success and victory
he described the cataract of glenn's the impregnable position of its
rocky island with its caverns and its numerous rapids and whirlpools
he named the name of la longue carabine and paused until the forest
beneath them had sent up the last echo of a loud and long yell with
which the hated appellation was received he pointed toward the youthful
military captive and described the death of a favorite warrior who
had been precipitated into the deep ravine by his hand he not only
mentioned the fate of him who hanging between heaven and earth had
presented such a spectacle of horror to the whole band but he acted
anew the terrors of his situation his resolution and his death on the
branches of a sapling and finally he rapidly recounted the manner
in which each of their friends had fallen never failing to touch upon
their courage and their most acknowledged virtues when this recital of
events was ended his voice once more changed and became plaintive and
even musical in its low guttural sounds he now spoke of the wives and
children of the slain their destitution their misery both physical
and moral their distance and at last of their unavenged wrongs then
suddenly lifting his voice to a pitch of terrific energy he concluded
by demanding

are the hurons dogs to bear this who shall say to the wife of menowgua
that the fishes have his scalp and that his nation have not taken
revenge who will dare meet the mother of wassawattimie that scornful
woman with his hands clean what shall be said to the old men when
they ask us for scalps and we have not a hair from a white head to give
them the women will point their fingers at us there is a dark spot on
the names of the hurons and it must be hid in blood his voice was no
longer audible in the burst of rage which now broke into the air as
if the wood instead of containing so small a band was filled with the
nation during the foregoing address the progress of the speaker was too
plainly read by those most interested in his success through the medium
of the countenances of the men he addressed they had answered his
melancholy and mourning by sympathy and sorrow his assertions by
gestures of confirmation and his boasting with the exultation of
savages when he spoke of courage their looks were firm and responsive
when he alluded to their injuries their eyes kindled with fury when
he mentioned the taunts of the women they dropped their heads in shame
but when he pointed out their means of vengeance he struck a chord
which never failed to thrill in the breast of an indian with the first
intimation that it was within their reach the whole band sprang upon
their feet as one man giving utterance to their rage in the most
frantic cries they rushed upon their prisoners in a body with drawn
knives and uplifted tomahawks heyward threw himself between the sisters
and the foremost whom he grappled with a desperate strength that for a
moment checked his violence this unexpected resistance gave magua time
to interpose and with rapid enunciation and animated gesture he drew
the attention of the band again to himself in that language he knew so
well how to assume he diverted his comrades from their instant purpose
and invited them to prolong the misery of their victims his proposal
was received with acclamations and executed with the swiftness of
thought

two powerful warriors cast themselves on heyward while another was
occupied in securing the less active singing-master neither of the
captives however submitted without a desperate though fruitless
struggle even david hurled his assailant to the earth nor was heyward
secured until the victory over his companion enabled the indians to
direct their united force to that object he was then bound and fastened
to the body of the sapling on whose branches magua had acted the
pantomime of the falling huron when the young soldier regained his
recollection he had the painful certainty before his eyes that a
common fate was intended for the whole party on his right was cora in
a durance similar to his own pale and agitated but with an eye whose
steady look still read the proceedings of their enemies on his left
the withes which bound her to a pine performed that office for alice
which her trembling limbs refused and alone kept her fragile form from
sinking her hands were clasped before her in prayer but instead of
looking upward toward that power which alone could rescue them her
unconscious looks wandered to the countenance of duncan with infantile
dependency david had contended and the novelty of the circumstance
held him silent in deliberation on the propriety of the unusual
occurrence

the vengeance of the hurons had now taken a new direction and they
prepared to execute it with that barbarous ingenuity with which they
were familiarized by the practise of centuries some sought knots to
raise the blazing pile one was riving the splinters of pine in order
to pierce the flesh of their captives with the burning fragments and
others bent the tops of two saplings to the earth in order to suspend
heyward by the arms between the recoiling branches but the vengeance of
magua sought a deeper and more malignant enjoyment

while the less refined monsters of the band prepared before the eyes of
those who were to suffer these well-known and vulgar means of torture
he approached cora and pointed out with the most malign expression of
countenance the speedy fate that awaited her

ha he added what says the daughter of munro her head is too good
to find a pillow in the wigwam of le renard will she like it better
when it rolls about this hill a plaything for the wolves her bosom
cannot nurse the children of a huron she will see it spit upon by
indians

what means the monster demanded the astonished heyward

nothing was the firm reply he is a savage a barbarous and ignorant
savage and knows not what he does let us find leisure with our dying
breath to ask for him penitence and pardon

pardon echoed the fierce huron mistaking in his anger the meaning
of her words the memory of an indian is no longer than the arm of the
pale faces his mercy shorter than their justice say shall i send the
yellow hair to her father and will you follow magua to the great lakes
to carry his water and feed him with corn

cora beckoned him away with an emotion of disgust she could not
control

leave me she said with a solemnity that for a moment checked the
barbarity of the indian you mingle bitterness in my prayers you stand
between me and my god

the slight impression produced on the savage was however soon
forgotten and he continued pointing with taunting irony toward alice

look the child weeps she is too young to die send her to munro to
comb his gray hairs and keep life in the heart of the old man

cora could not resist the desire to look upon her youthful sister in
whose eyes she met an imploring glance that betrayed the longings of
nature

what says he dearest cora asked the trembling voice of alice did
he speak of sending me to our father

for many moments the elder sister looked upon the younger with a
countenance that wavered with powerful and contending emotions
at length she spoke though her tones had lost their rich and calm
fullness in an expression of tenderness that seemed maternal

alice she said the huron offers us both life nay more than both
he offers to restore duncan our invaluable duncan as well as you to
our friends to our father to our heart-stricken childless father if
i will bow down this rebellious stubborn pride of mine and consent 

her voice became choked and clasping her hands she looked upward as
if seeking in her agony intelligence from a wisdom that was infinite

say on cried alice to what dearest cora oh that the proffer were
made to me to save you to cheer our aged father to restore duncan
how cheerfully could i die

die repeated cora with a calmer and firmer voice that were easy
perhaps the alternative may not be less so he would have me she
continued her accents sinking under a deep consciousness of the
degradation of the proposal follow him to the wilderness go to the
habitations of the hurons to remain there in short to become his
wife speak then alice child of my affections sister of my love and
you too major heyward aid my weak reason with your counsel is life
to be purchased by such a sacrifice will you alice receive it at my
hands at such a price and you duncan guide me control me between
you for i am wholly yours

would i echoed the indignant and astonished youth cora cora you
jest with our misery name not the horrid alternative again the thought
itself is worse than a thousand deaths

that such would be your answer i well knew exclaimed cora her
cheeks flushing and her dark eyes once more sparkling with the
lingering emotions of a woman what says my alice for her will i
submit without another murmur

although both heyward and cora listened with painful suspense and the
deepest attention no sounds were heard in reply it appeared as if the
delicate and sensitive form of alice would shrink into itself as she
listened to this proposal her arms had fallen lengthwise before her
the fingers moving in slight convulsions her head dropped upon her
bosom and her whole person seemed suspended against the tree looking
like some beautiful emblem of the wounded delicacy of her sex devoid of
animation and yet keenly conscious in a few moments however her head
began to move slowly in a sign of deep unconquerable disapprobation

no no no better that we die as we have lived together

then die shouted magua hurling his tomahawk with violence at the
unresisting speaker and gnashing his teeth with a rage that could no
longer be bridled at this sudden exhibition of firmness in the one he
believed the weakest of the party the axe cleaved the air in front of
heyward and cutting some of the flowing ringlets of alice quivered
in the tree above her head the sight maddened duncan to desperation
collecting all his energies in one effort he snapped the twigs which
bound him and rushed upon another savage who was preparing with loud
yells and a more deliberate aim to repeat the blow they encountered
grappled and fell to the earth together the naked body of his
antagonist afforded heyward no means of holding his adversary who
glided from his grasp and rose again with one knee on his chest
pressing him down with the weight of a giant duncan already saw the
knife gleaming in the air when a whistling sound swept past him and
was rather accompanied than followed by the sharp crack of a rifle he
felt his breast relieved from the load it had endured he saw the savage
expression of his adversary's countenance change to a look of vacant
wildness when the indian fell dead on the faded leaves by his side




chapter 

 clo i am gone sire
 and anon sire i'll be with you again
 twelfth night

the hurons stood aghast at this sudden visitation of death on one of
their band but as they regarded the fatal accuracy of an aim which had
dared to immolate an enemy at so much hazard to a friend the name
of la longue carabine burst simultaneously from every lip and was
succeeded by a wild and a sort of plaintive howl the cry was answered
by a loud shout from a little thicket where the incautious party had
piled their arms and at the next moment hawkeye too eager to load
the rifle he had regained was seen advancing upon them brandishing the
clubbed weapon and cutting the air with wide and powerful sweeps bold
and rapid as was the progress of the scout it was exceeded by that of
a light and vigorous form which bounding past him leaped with
incredible activity and daring into the very center of the hurons
where it stood whirling a tomahawk and flourishing a glittering knife
with fearful menaces in front of cora quicker than the thoughts could
follow those unexpected and audacious movements an image armed in the
emblematic panoply of death glided before their eyes and assumed a
threatening attitude at the other's side the savage tormentors recoiled
before these warlike intruders and uttered as they appeared in such
quick succession the often repeated and peculiar exclamations of
surprise followed by the well-known and dreaded appellations of

le cerf agile le gros serpent

but the wary and vigilant leader of the hurons was not so easily
disconcerted casting his keen eyes around the little plain he
comprehended the nature of the assault at a glance and encouraging his
followers by his voice as well as by his example he unsheathed his
long and dangerous knife and rushed with a loud whoop upon the expected
chingachgook it was the signal for a general combat neither party had
firearms and the contest was to be decided in the deadliest manner
hand to hand with weapons of offense and none of defense

uncas answered the whoop and leaping on an enemy with a single
well-directed blow of his tomahawk cleft him to the brain heyward
tore the weapon of magua from the sapling and rushed eagerly toward
the fray as the combatants were now equal in number each singled an
opponent from the adverse band the rush and blows passed with the fury
of a whirlwind and the swiftness of lightning hawkeye soon got another
enemy within reach of his arm and with one sweep of his formidable
weapon he beat down the slight and inartificial defenses of his
antagonist crushing him to the earth with the blow heyward ventured
to hurl the tomahawk he had seized too ardent to await the moment
of closing it struck the indian he had selected on the forehead
and checked for an instant his onward rush encouraged by this slight
advantage the impetuous young man continued his onset and sprang upon
his enemy with naked hands a single instant was enough to assure him
of the rashness of the measure for he immediately found himself fully
engaged with all his activity and courage in endeavoring to ward the
desperate thrusts made with the knife of the huron unable longer to
foil an enemy so alert and vigilant he threw his arms about him and
succeeded in pinning the limbs of the other to his side with an iron
grasp but one that was far too exhausting to himself to continue long
in this extremity he heard a voice near him shouting

extarminate the varlets no quarter to an accursed mingo

at the next moment the breech of hawkeye's rifle fell on the naked head
of his adversary whose muscles appeared to wither under the shock as
he sank from the arms of duncan flexible and motionless

when uncas had brained his first antagonist he turned like a hungry
lion to seek another the fifth and only huron disengaged at the first
onset had paused a moment and then seeing that all around him were
employed in the deadly strife he had sought with hellish vengeance
to complete the baffled work of revenge raising a shout of triumph he
sprang toward the defenseless cora sending his keen axe as the dreadful
precursor of his approach the tomahawk grazed her shoulder and cutting
the withes which bound her to the tree left the maiden at liberty to
fly she eluded the grasp of the savage and reckless of her own
safety threw herself on the bosom of alice striving with convulsed
and ill-directed fingers to tear asunder the twigs which confined the
person of her sister any other than a monster would have relented at
such an act of generous devotion to the best and purest affection but
the breast of the huron was a stranger to sympathy seizing cora by the
rich tresses which fell in confusion about her form he tore her from
her frantic hold and bowed her down with brutal violence to her knees
the savage drew the flowing curls through his hand and raising them
on high with an outstretched arm he passed the knife around the
exquisitely molded head of his victim with a taunting and exulting
laugh but he purchased this moment of fierce gratification with the
loss of the fatal opportunity it was just then the sight caught the eye
of uncas bounding from his footsteps he appeared for an instant darting
through the air and descending in a ball he fell on the chest of his
enemy driving him many yards from the spot headlong and prostrate the
violence of the exertion cast the young mohican at his side they arose
together fought and bled each in his turn but the conflict was soon
decided the tomahawk of heyward and the rifle of hawkeye descended
on the skull of the huron at the same moment that the knife of uncas
reached his heart

the battle was now entirely terminated with the exception of the
protracted struggle between le renard subtil and le gros serpent
well did these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved those
significant names which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars
when they engaged some little time was lost in eluding the quick and
vigorous thrusts which had been aimed at their lives suddenly darting
on each other they closed and came to the earth twisted together like
twining serpents in pliant and subtle folds at the moment when the
victors found themselves unoccupied the spot where these experienced
and desperate combatants lay could only be distinguished by a cloud of
dust and leaves which moved from the center of the little plain toward
its boundary as if raised by the passage of a whirlwind urged by the
different motives of filial affection friendship and gratitude heyward
and his companions rushed with one accord to the place encircling the
little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors in vain did uncas
dart around the cloud with a wish to strike his knife into the heart
of his father's foe the threatening rifle of hawkeye was raised and
suspended in vain while duncan endeavored to seize the limbs of the
huron with hands that appeared to have lost their power covered as they
were with dust and blood the swift evolutions of the combatants seemed
to incorporate their bodies into one the death-like looking figure of
the mohican and the dark form of the huron gleamed before their eyes
in such quick and confused succession that the friends of the former
knew not where to plant the succoring blow it is true there were short
and fleeting moments when the fiery eyes of magua were seen glittering
like the fabled organs of the basilisk through the dusty wreath by which
he was enveloped and he read by those short and deadly glances the fate
of the combat in the presence of his enemies ere however any hostile
hand could descend on his devoted head its place was filled by the
scowling visage of chingachgook in this manner the scene of the combat
was removed from the center of the little plain to its verge the
mohican now found an opportunity to make a powerful thrust with his
knife magua suddenly relinquished his grasp and fell backward without
motion and seemingly without life his adversary leaped on his feet
making the arches of the forest ring with the sounds of triumph

well done for the delawares victory to the mohicans cried hawkeye
once more elevating the butt of the long and fatal rifle a finishing
blow from a man without a cross will never tell against his honor nor
rob him of his right to the scalp

but at the very moment when the dangerous weapon was in the act of
descending the subtle huron rolled swiftly from beneath the danger
over the edge of the precipice and falling on his feet was seen
leaping with a single bound into the center of a thicket of low
bushes which clung along its sides the delawares who had believed
their enemy dead uttered their exclamation of surprise and were
following with speed and clamor like hounds in open view of the deer
when a shrill and peculiar cry from the scout instantly changed their
purpose and recalled them to the summit of the hill

twas like himself cried the inveterate forester whose prejudices
contributed so largely to veil his natural sense of justice in all
matters which concerned the mingoes a lying and deceitful varlet as
he is an honest delaware now being fairly vanquished would have lain
still and been knocked on the head but these knavish maquas cling to
life like so many cats-o-the-mountain let him go let him go tis but
one man and he without rifle or bow many a long mile from his french
commerades and like a rattler that lost his fangs he can do no further
mischief until such time as he and we too may leave the prints of our
moccasins over a long reach of sandy plain see uncas he added in
delaware your father is flaying the scalps already it may be well to
go round and feel the vagabonds that are left or we may have another of
them loping through the woods and screeching like a jay that has been
winged

so saying the honest but implacable scout made the circuit of the dead
into whose senseless bosoms he thrust his long knife with as much
coolness as though they had been so many brute carcasses he had
however been anticipated by the elder mohican who had already torn the
emblems of victory from the unresisting heads of the slain

but uncas denying his habits we had almost said his nature flew with
instinctive delicacy accompanied by heyward to the assistance of the
females and quickly releasing alice placed her in the arms of cora we
shall not attempt to describe the gratitude to the almighty disposer
of events which glowed in the bosoms of the sisters who were thus
unexpectedly restored to life and to each other their thanksgivings
were deep and silent the offerings of their gentle spirits burning
brightest and purest on the secret altars of their hearts and their
renovated and more earthly feelings exhibiting themselves in long and
fervent though speechless caresses as alice rose from her knees where
she had sunk by the side of cora she threw herself on the bosom of the
latter and sobbed aloud the name of their aged father while her soft
dove-like eyes sparkled with the rays of hope

we are saved we are saved she murmured to return to the arms of
our dear dear father and his heart will not be broken with grief and
you too cora my sister my more than sister my mother you too
are spared and duncan she added looking round upon the youth with a
smile of ineffable innocence even our own brave and noble duncan has
escaped without a hurt

to these ardent and nearly innocent words cora made no other answer than
by straining the youthful speaker to her heart as she bent over her
in melting tenderness the manhood of heyward felt no shame in dropping
tears over this spectacle of affectionate rapture and uncas stood
fresh and blood-stained from the combat a calm and apparently an
unmoved looker-on it is true but with eyes that had already lost their
fierceness and were beaming with a sympathy that elevated him far
above the intelligence and advanced him probably centuries before the
practises of his nation

during this display of emotions so natural in their situation hawkeye
whose vigilant distrust had satisfied itself that the hurons who
disfigured the heavenly scene no longer possessed the power to
interrupt its harmony approached david and liberated him from the
bonds he had until that moment endured with the most exemplary
patience

there exclaimed the scout casting the last withe behind him you
are once more master of your own limbs though you seem not to use them
with much greater judgment than that in which they were first fashioned
if advice from one who is not older than yourself but who having
lived most of his time in the wilderness may be said to have experience
beyond his years will give no offense you are welcome to my thoughts
and these are to part with the little tooting instrument in your jacket
to the first fool you meet with and buy some we'pon with the money if
it be only the barrel of a horseman's pistol by industry and care you
might thus come to some prefarment for by this time i should think
your eyes would plainly tell you that a carrion crow is a better bird
than a mocking-thresher the one will at least remove foul sights
from before the face of man while the other is only good to brew
disturbances in the woods by cheating the ears of all that hear them

arms and the clarion for the battle but the song of thanksgiving
to the victory answered the liberated david friend he added
thrusting forth his lean delicate hand toward hawkeye in kindness
while his eyes twinkled and grew moist i thank thee that the hairs
of my head still grow where they were first rooted by providence for
though those of other men may be more glossy and curling i have ever
found mine own well suited to the brain they shelter that i did not
join myself to the battle was less owing to disinclination than to the
bonds of the heathen valiant and skillful hast thou proved thyself in
the conflict and i hereby thank thee before proceeding to discharge
other and more important duties because thou hast proved thyself well
worthy of a christian's praise

the thing is but a trifle and what you may often see if you tarry long
among us returned the scout a good deal softened toward the man of
song by this unequivocal expression of gratitude i have got back my
old companion killdeer he added striking his hand on the breech of
his rifle and that in itself is a victory these iroquois are cunning
but they outwitted themselves when they placed their firearms out of
reach and had uncas or his father been gifted with only their common
indian patience we should have come in upon the knaves with three
bullets instead of one and that would have made a finish of the whole
pack yon loping varlet as well as his commerades but twas all
fore-ordered and for the best

thou sayest well returned david and hast caught the true spirit
of christianity he that is to be saved will be saved and he that is
predestined to be damned will be damned this is the doctrine of truth
and most consoling and refreshing it is to the true believer

the scout who by this time was seated examining into the state of his
rifle with a species of parental assiduity now looked up at the other
in a displeasure that he did not affect to conceal roughly interrupting
further speech

doctrine or no doctrine said the sturdy woodsman tis the belief of
knaves and the curse of an honest man i can credit that yonder huron
was to fall by my hand for with my own eyes i have seen it but nothing
short of being a witness will cause me to think he has met with any
reward or that chingachgook there will be condemned at the final day

you have no warranty for such an audacious doctrine nor any covenant
to support it cried david who was deeply tinctured with the subtle
distinctions which in his time and more especially in his province
had been drawn around the beautiful simplicity of revelation by
endeavoring to penetrate the awful mystery of the divine nature
supplying faith by self-sufficiency and by consequence involving those
who reasoned from such human dogmas in absurdities and doubt your
temple is reared on the sands and the first tempest will wash away its
foundation i demand your authorities for such an uncharitable assertion
like other advocates of a system david was not always accurate in his
use of terms name chapter and verse in which of the holy books do you
find language to support you

book repeated hawkeye with singular and ill-concealed disdain do
you take me for a whimpering boy at the apronstring of one of your old
gals and this good rifle on my knee for the feather of a goose's
wing my ox's horn for a bottle of ink and my leathern pouch for a
cross-barred handkercher to carry my dinner book what have such as i
who am a warrior of the wilderness though a man without a cross to
do with books i never read but in one and the words that are written
there are too simple and too plain to need much schooling though i may
boast that of forty long and hard-working years

what call you the volume said david misconceiving the other's
meaning

tis open before your eyes returned the scout and he who owns it
is not a niggard of its use i have heard it said that there are men who
read in books to convince themselves there is a god i know not but man
may so deform his works in the settlement as to leave that which is so
clear in the wilderness a matter of doubt among traders and priests if
any such there be and he will follow me from sun to sun through the
windings of the forest he shall see enough to teach him that he is a
fool and that the greatest of his folly lies in striving to rise to the
level of one he can never equal be it in goodness or be it in power

the instant david discovered that he battled with a disputant who
imbibed his faith from the lights of nature eschewing all subtleties
of doctrine he willingly abandoned a controversy from which he believed
neither profit nor credit was to be derived while the scout was
speaking he had also seated himself and producing the ready little
volume and the iron-rimmed spectacles he prepared to discharge a
duty which nothing but the unexpected assault he had received in his
orthodoxy could have so long suspended he was in truth a minstrel of
the western continent of a much later day certainly than those gifted
bards who formerly sang the profane renown of baron and prince but
after the spirit of his own age and country and he was now prepared
to exercise the cunning of his craft in celebration of or rather in
thanksgiving for the recent victory he waited patiently for hawkeye to
cease then lifting his eyes together with his voice he said aloud

i invite you friends to join in praise for this signal deliverance
from the hands of barbarians and infidels to the comfortable and solemn
tones of the tune called northampton

he next named the page and verse where the rhymes selected were to be
found and applied the pitch-pipe to his lips with the decent gravity
that he had been wont to use in the temple this time he was however
without any accompaniment for the sisters were just then pouring out
those tender effusions of affection which have been already alluded
to nothing deterred by the smallness of his audience which in
truth consisted only of the discontented scout he raised his voice
commencing and ending the sacred song without accident or interruption
of any kind

hawkeye listened while he coolly adjusted his flint and reloaded his
rifle but the sounds wanting the extraneous assistance of scene and
sympathy failed to awaken his slumbering emotions never minstrel
or by whatever more suitable name david should be known drew upon his
talents in the presence of more insensible auditors though considering
the singleness and sincerity of his motive it is probable that no bard
of profane song ever uttered notes that ascended so near to that throne
where all homage and praise is due the scout shook his head and
muttering some unintelligible words among which throat and iroquois
were alone audible he walked away to collect and to examine into the
state of the captured arsenal of the hurons in this office he was now
joined by chingachgook who found his own as well as the rifle of his
son among the arms even heyward and david were furnished with weapons
nor was ammunition wanting to render them all effectual

when the foresters had made their selection and distributed their
prizes the scout announced that the hour had arrived when it was
necessary to move by this time the song of gamut had ceased and the
sisters had learned to still the exhibition of their emotions aided by
duncan and the younger mohican the two latter descended the precipitous
sides of that hill which they had so lately ascended under so very
different auspices and whose summit had so nearly proved the scene of
their massacre at the foot they found the narragansetts browsing the
herbage of the bushes and having mounted they followed the movements
of a guide who in the most deadly straits had so often proved himself
their friend the journey was however short hawkeye leaving the
blind path that the hurons had followed turned short to his right
and entering the thicket he crossed a babbling brook and halted in a
narrow dell under the shade of a few water elms their distance from
the base of the fatal hill was but a few rods and the steeds had been
serviceable only in crossing the shallow stream

the scout and the indians appeared to be familiar with the sequestered
place where they now were for leaning their rifle against the trees
they commenced throwing aside the dried leaves and opening the blue
clay out of which a clear and sparkling spring of bright glancing
water quickly bubbled the white man then looked about him as though
seeking for some object which was not to be found as readily as he
expected

them careless imps the mohawks with their tuscarora and onondaga
brethren have been here slaking their thirst he muttered and the
vagabonds have thrown away the gourd this is the way with benefits
when they are bestowed on such disremembering hounds here has the lord
laid his hand in the midst of the howling wilderness for their good
and raised a fountain of water from the bowels of the arth that might
laugh at the richest shop of apothecary's ware in all the colonies and
see the knaves have trodden in the clay and deformed the cleanliness
of the place as though they were brute beasts instead of human men

uncas silently extended toward him the desired gourd which the spleen
of hawkeye had hitherto prevented him from observing on a branch of
an elm filling it with water he retired a short distance to a place
where the ground was more firm and dry here he coolly seated himself
and after taking a long and apparently a grateful draught he
commenced a very strict examination of the fragments of food left by the
hurons which had hung in a wallet on his arm

thank you lad he continued returning the empty gourd to uncas
now we will see how these rampaging hurons lived when outlying in
ambushments look at this the varlets know the better pieces of the
deer and one would think they might carve and roast a saddle equal to
the best cook in the land but everything is raw for the iroquois are
thorough savages uncas take my steel and kindle a fire a mouthful of
a tender broil will give natur a helping hand after so long a trail

heyward perceiving that their guides now set about their repast in
sober earnest assisted the ladies to alight and placed himself at
their side not unwilling to enjoy a few moments of grateful rest after
the bloody scene he had just gone through while the culinary process
was in hand curiosity induced him to inquire into the circumstances
which had led to their timely and unexpected rescue

how is it that we see you so soon my generous friend he asked and
without aid from the garrison of edward

had we gone to the bend in the river we might have been in time
to rake the leaves over your bodies but too late to have saved your
scalps coolly answered the scout no no instead of throwing away
strength and opportunity by crossing to the fort we lay by under the
bank of the hudson waiting to watch the movements of the hurons

you were then witnesses of all that passed

not of all for indian sight is too keen to be easily cheated and we
kept close a difficult matter it was too to keep this mohican boy
snug in the ambushment ah uncas uncas your behavior was more like
that of a curious woman than of a warrior on his scent

uncas permitted his eyes to turn for an instant on the sturdy
countenance of the speaker but he neither spoke nor gave any indication
of repentance on the contrary heyward thought the manner of the young
mohican was disdainful if not a little fierce and that he suppressed
passions that were ready to explode as much in compliment to the
listeners as from the deference he usually paid to his white associate

you saw our capture heyward next demanded

we heard it was the significant answer an indian yell is plain
language to men who have passed their days in the woods but when you
landed we were driven to crawl like sarpents beneath the leaves and
then we lost sight of you entirely until we placed eyes on you again
trussed to the trees and ready bound for an indian massacre

our rescue was the deed of providence it was nearly a miracle that you
did not mistake the path for the hurons divided and each band had its
horses

ay there we were thrown off the scent and might indeed have lost
the trail had it not been for uncas we took the path however that
led into the wilderness for we judged and judged rightly that the
savages would hold that course with their prisoners but when we had
followed it for many miles without finding a single twig broken as i
had advised my mind misgave me especially as all the footsteps had the
prints of moccasins

our captors had the precaution to see us shod like themselves said
duncan raising a foot and exhibiting the buckskin he wore

aye twas judgmatical and like themselves though we were too expart
to be thrown from a trail by so common an invention

to what then are we indebted for our safety

to what as a white man who has no taint of indian blood i should be
ashamed to own to the judgment of the young mohican in matters which
i should know better than he but which i can now hardly believe to be
true though my own eyes tell me it is so

tis extraordinary will you not name the reason

uncas was bold enough to say that the beasts ridden by the gentle
ones continued hawkeye glancing his eyes not without curious
interest on the fillies of the ladies planted the legs of one side on
the ground at the same time which is contrary to the movements of all
trotting four-footed animals of my knowledge except the bear and yet
here are horses that always journey in this manner as my own eyes have
seen and as their trail has shown for twenty long miles

tis the merit of the animal they come from the shores of
narrangansett bay in the small province of providence plantations
and are celebrated for their hardihood and the ease of this peculiar
movement though other horses are not unfrequently trained to the same

it may be it may be said hawkeye who had listened with singular
attention to this explanation though i am a man who has the full blood
of the whites my judgment in deer and beaver is greater than in beasts
of burden major effingham has many noble chargers but i have never
seen one travel after such a sidling gait

true for he would value the animals for very different properties
still is this a breed highly esteemed and as you witness much honored
with the burdens it is often destined to bear

the mohicans had suspended their operations about the glimmering fire
to listen and when duncan had done they looked at each other
significantly the father uttering the never-failing exclamation of
surprise the scout ruminated like a man digesting his newly-acquired
knowledge and once more stole a glance at the horses

i dare to say there are even stranger sights to be seen in the
settlements he said at length natur is sadly abused by man when
he once gets the mastery but go sidling or go straight uncas had seen
the movement and their trail led us on to the broken bush the outer
branch near the prints of one of the horses was bent upward as a lady
breaks a flower from its stem but all the rest were ragged and broken
down as if the strong hand of a man had been tearing them so i
concluded that the cunning varments had seen the twig bent and had torn
the rest to make us believe a buck had been feeling the boughs with his
antlers

i do believe your sagacity did not deceive you for some such thing
occurred

that was easy to see added the scout in no degree conscious of
having exhibited any extraordinary sagacity and a very different
matter it was from a waddling horse it then struck me the mingoes
would push for this spring for the knaves well know the vartue of its
waters

is it then so famous demanded heyward examining with a more
curious eye the secluded dell with its bubbling fountain surrounded
as it was by earth of a deep dingy brown

few red-skins who travel south and east of the great lakes but have
heard of its qualities will you taste for yourself

heyward took the gourd and after swallowing a little of the water
threw it aside with grimaces of discontent the scout laughed in his
silent but heartfelt manner and shook his head with vast satisfaction

ah you want the flavor that one gets by habit the time was when i
liked it as little as yourself but i have come to my taste and i now
crave it as a deer does the licks your high-spiced wines are not
better liked than a red-skin relishes this water especially when his
natur is ailing but uncas has made his fire and it is time we think
of eating for our journey is long and all before us

 many of the animals of the american forests resort to
 those spots where salt springs are found these are called
 licks or salt licks in the language of the country
 from the circumstance that the quadruped is often obliged to
 lick the earth in order to obtain the saline particles
 these licks are great places of resort with the hunters who
 waylay their game near the paths that lead to them

interrupting the dialogue by this abrupt transition the scout had
instant recourse to the fragments of food which had escaped the voracity
of the hurons a very summary process completed the simple cookery when
he and the mohicans commenced their humble meal with the silence and
characteristic diligence of men who ate in order to enable themselves to
endure great and unremitting toil

when this necessary and happily grateful duty had been performed
each of the foresters stooped and took a long and parting draught at
that solitary and silent spring around which and its sister fountains
within fifty years the wealth beauty and talents of a hemisphere were
to assemble in throngs in pursuit of health and pleasure then hawkeye
announced his determination to proceed the sisters resumed their
saddles duncan and david grapsed their rifles and followed on
footsteps the scout leading the advance and the mohicans bringing up
the rear the whole party moved swiftly through the narrow path toward
the north leaving the healing waters to mingle unheeded with the
adjacent brooks and the bodies of the dead to fester on the neighboring
mount without the rites of sepulture a fate but too common to the
warriors of the woods to excite either commiseration or comment

 the scene of the foregoing incidents is on the spot where
 the village of ballston now stands one of the two principal
 watering places of america




chapter 

 i'll seek a readier path
 parnell

the route taken by hawkeye lay across those sandy plains relived by
occasional valleys and swells of land which had been traversed by their
party on the morning of the same day with the baffled magua for their
guide the sun had now fallen low toward the distant mountains and
as their journey lay through the interminable forest the heat was no
longer oppressive their progress in consequence was proportionate
and long before the twilight gathered about them they had made good
many toilsome miles on their return

the hunter like the savage whose place he filled seemed to select
among the blind signs of their wild route with a species of instinct
seldom abating his speed and never pausing to deliberate a rapid and
oblique glance at the moss on the trees with an occasional upward gaze
toward the setting sun or a steady but passing look at the direction of
the numerous water courses through which he waded were sufficient
to determine his path and remove his greatest difficulties in the
meantime the forest began to change its hues losing that lively green
which had embellished its arches in the graver light which is the usual
precursor of the close of day

while the eyes of the sisters were endeavoring to catch glimpses through
the trees of the flood of golden glory which formed a glittering halo
around the sun tinging here and there with ruby streaks or bordering
with narrow edgings of shining yellow a mass of clouds that lay piled
at no great distance above the western hills hawkeye turned suddenly
and pointing upward toward the gorgeous heavens he spoke

yonder is the signal given to man to seek his food and natural rest
he said better and wiser would it be if he could understand the signs
of nature and take a lesson from the fowls of the air and the beasts of
the field our night however will soon be over for with the moon
we must be up and moving again i remember to have fou't the maquas
hereaways in the first war in which i ever drew blood from man and we
threw up a work of blocks to keep the ravenous varmints from handling
our scalps if my marks do not fail me we shall find the place a few
rods further to our left

without waiting for an assent or indeed for any reply the sturdy
hunter moved boldly into a dense thicket of young chestnuts shoving
aside the branches of the exuberant shoots which nearly covered the
ground like a man who expected at each step to discover some object
he had formerly known the recollection of the scout did not deceive
him after penetrating through the brush matted as it was with briars
for a few hundred feet he entered an open space that surrounded a low
green hillock which was crowned by the decayed blockhouse in question
this rude and neglected building was one of those deserted works which
having been thrown up on an emergency had been abandoned with the
disappearance of danger and was now quietly crumbling in the solitude
of the forest neglected and nearly forgotten like the circumstances
which had caused it to be reared such memorials of the passage and
struggles of man are yet frequent throughout the broad barrier of
wilderness which once separated the hostile provinces and form a
species of ruins that are intimately associated with the recollections
of colonial history and which are in appropriate keeping with the
gloomy character of the surrounding scenery the roof of bark had long
since fallen and mingled with the soil but the huge logs of pine
which had been hastily thrown together still preserved their relative
positions though one angle of the work had given way under the
pressure and threatened a speedy downfall to the remainder of the
rustic edifice while heyward and his companions hesitated to approach
a building so decayed hawkeye and the indians entered within the low
walls not only without fear but with obvious interest while the
former surveyed the ruins both internally and externally with the
curiosity of one whose recollections were reviving at each moment
chingachgook related to his son in the language of the delawares and
with the pride of a conqueror the brief history of the skirmish which
had been fought in his youth in that secluded spot a strain of
melancholy however blended with his triumph rendering his voice as
usual soft and musical

in the meantime the sisters gladly dismounted and prepared to enjoy
their halt in the coolness of the evening and in a security which they
believed nothing but the beasts of the forest could invade

would not our resting-place have been more retired my worthy friend
demanded the more vigilant duncan perceiving that the scout had already
finished his short survey had we chosen a spot less known and one
more rarely visited than this

few live who know the blockhouse was ever raised was the slow and
musing answer tis not often that books are made and narratives
written of such a scrimmage as was here fou't atween the mohicans and
the mohawks in a war of their own waging i was then a younker and
went out with the delawares because i know'd they were a scandalized
and wronged race forty days and forty nights did the imps crave our
blood around this pile of logs which i designed and partly reared
being as you'll remember no indian myself but a man without a cross
the delawares lent themselves to the work and we made it good ten to
twenty until our numbers were nearly equal and then we sallied out
upon the hounds and not a man of them ever got back to tell the fate
of his party yes yes i was then young and new to the sight of blood
and not relishing the thought that creatures who had spirits like myself
should lay on the naked ground to be torn asunder by beasts or to
bleach in the rains i buried the dead with my own hands under that
very little hillock where you have placed yourselves and no bad seat
does it make neither though it be raised by the bones of mortal men

heyward and the sisters arose on the instant from the grassy
sepulcher nor could the two latter notwithstanding the terrific scenes
they had so recently passed through entirely suppress an emotion of
natural horror when they found themselves in such familiar contact with
the grave of the dead mohawks the gray light the gloomy little area
of dark grass surrounded by its border of brush beyond which the pines
rose in breathing silence apparently into the very clouds and the
deathlike stillness of the vast forest were all in unison to deepen
such a sensation they are gone and they are harmless continued
hawkeye waving his hand with a melancholy smile at their manifest
alarm they'll never shout the war-whoop nor strike a blow with the
tomahawk again and of all those who aided in placing them where they
lie chingachgook and i only are living the brothers and family of the
mohican formed our war party and you see before you all that are now
left of his race

the eyes of the listeners involuntarily sought the forms of the indians
with a compassionate interest in their desolate fortune their dark
persons were still to be seen within the shadows of the blockhouse
the son listening to the relation of his father with that sort of
intenseness which would be created by a narrative that redounded so much
to the honor of those whose names he had long revered for their courage
and savage virtues

i had thought the delawares a pacific people said duncan and that
they never waged war in person trusting the defense of their hands to
those very mohawks that you slew

tis true in part returned the scout and yet at the bottom tis
a wicked lie such a treaty was made in ages gone by through the
deviltries of the dutchers who wished to disarm the natives that had
the best right to the country where they had settled themselves the
mohicans though a part of the same nation having to deal with the
english never entered into the silly bargain but kept to their
manhood as in truth did the delawares when their eyes were open to
their folly you see before you a chief of the great mohican sagamores
once his family could chase their deer over tracts of country wider than
that which belongs to the albany patteroon without crossing brook or
hill that was not their own but what is left of their descendant he
may find his six feet of earth when god chooses and keep it in peace
perhaps if he has a friend who will take the pains to sink his head so
low that the plowshares cannot reach it

enough said heyward apprehensive that the subject might lead to
a discussion that would interrupt the harmony so necessary to the
preservation of his fair companions we have journeyed far and few
among us are blessed with forms like that of yours which seems to know
neither fatigue nor weakness

the sinews and bones of a man carry me through it all said the
hunter surveying his muscular limbs with a simplicity that betrayed
the honest pleasure the compliment afforded him there are larger and
heavier men to be found in the settlements but you might travel many
days in a city before you could meet one able to walk fifty miles
without stopping to take breath or who has kept the hounds within
hearing during a chase of hours however as flesh and blood are not
always the same it is quite reasonable to suppose that the gentle ones
are willing to rest after all they have seen and done this day uncas
clear out the spring while your father and i make a cover for their
tender heads of these chestnut shoots and a bed of grass and leaves

the dialogue ceased while the hunter and his companions busied
themselves in preparations for the comfort and protection of those they
guided a spring which many long years before had induced the natives
to select the place for their temporary fortification was soon cleared
of leaves and a fountain of crystal gushed from the bed diffusing
its waters over the verdant hillock a corner of the building was then
roofed in such a manner as to exclude the heavy dew of the climate
and piles of sweet shrubs and dried leaves were laid beneath it for the
sisters to repose on

while the diligent woodsmen were employed in this manner cora and
alice partook of that refreshment which duty required much more than
inclination prompted them to accept they then retired within the
walls and first offering up their thanksgivings for past mercies and
petitioning for a continuance of the divine favor throughout the coming
night they laid their tender forms on the fragrant couch and in spite
of recollections and forebodings soon sank into those slumbers which
nature so imperiously demanded and which were sweetened by hopes
for the morrow duncan had prepared himself to pass the night in
watchfulness near them just without the ruin but the scout perceiving
his intention pointed toward chingachgook as he coolly disposed his
own person on the grass and said

the eyes of a white man are too heavy and too blind for such a watch as
this the mohican will be our sentinel therefore let us sleep

i proved myself a sluggard on my post during the past night said
heyward and have less need of repose than you who did more credit
to the character of a soldier let all the party seek their rest then
while i hold the guard

if we lay among the white tents of the sixtieth and in front of an
enemy like the french i could not ask for a better watchman returned
the scout but in the darkness and among the signs of the wilderness
your judgment would be like the folly of a child and your vigilance
thrown away do then like uncas and myself sleep and sleep in
safety

heyward perceived in truth that the younger indian had thrown his form
on the side of the hillock while they were talking like one who sought
to make the most of the time allotted to rest and that his example had
been followed by david whose voice literally clove to his jaws with
the fever of his wound heightened as it was by their toilsome march
unwilling to prolong a useless discussion the young man affected to
comply by posting his back against the logs of the blockhouse in a
half recumbent posture though resolutely determined in his own mind
not to close an eye until he had delivered his precious charge into the
arms of munro himself hawkeye believing he had prevailed soon fell
asleep and a silence as deep as the solitude in which they had found
it pervaded the retired spot

for many minutes duncan succeeded in keeping his senses on the alert
and alive to every moaning sound that arose from the forest his vision
became more acute as the shades of evening settled on the place and
even after the stars were glimmering above his head he was able to
distinguish the recumbent forms of his companions as they lay stretched
on the grass and to note the person of chingachgook who sat upright
and motionless as one of the trees which formed the dark barrier on
every side he still heard the gentle breathings of the sisters who lay
within a few feet of him and not a leaf was ruffled by the passing
air of which his ear did not detect the whispering sound at length
however the mournful notes of a whip-poor-will became blended with the
moanings of an owl his heavy eyes occasionally sought the bright rays
of the stars and he then fancied he saw them through the fallen lids
at instants of momentary wakefulness he mistook a bush for his associate
sentinel his head next sank upon his shoulder which in its turn
sought the support of the ground and finally his whole person became
relaxed and pliant and the young man sank into a deep sleep dreaming
that he was a knight of ancient chivalry holding his midnight vigils
before the tent of a recaptured princess whose favor he did not despair
of gaining by such a proof of devotion and watchfulness

how long the tired duncan lay in this insensible state he never
knew himself but his slumbering visions had been long lost in total
forgetfulness when he was awakened by a light tap on the shoulder
aroused by this signal slight as it was he sprang upon his feet with
a confused recollection of the self-imposed duty he had assumed with the
commencement of the night

who comes he demanded feeling for his sword at the place where it
was usually suspended speak friend or enemy

friend replied the low voice of chingachgook who pointing upward
at the luminary which was shedding its mild light through the opening
in the trees directly in their bivouac immediately added in his rude
english moon comes and white man's fort far far off time to move
when sleep shuts both eyes of the frenchman

you say true call up your friends and bridle the horses while i
prepare my own companions for the march

we are awake duncan said the soft silvery tones of alice within the
building and ready to travel very fast after so refreshing a sleep
but you have watched through the tedious night in our behalf after
having endured so much fatigue the livelong day

say rather i would have watched but my treacherous eyes betrayed me
twice have i proved myself unfit for the trust i bear

nay duncan deny it not interrupted the smiling alice issuing
from the shadows of the building into the light of the moon in all the
loveliness of her freshened beauty i know you to be a heedless one
when self is the object of your care and but too vigilant in favor of
others can we not tarry here a little longer while you find the rest
you need cheerfully most cheerfully will cora and i keep the vigils
while you and all these brave men endeavor to snatch a little sleep

if shame could cure me of my drowsiness i should never close an eye
again said the uneasy youth gazing at the ingenuous countenance
of alice where however in its sweet solicitude he read nothing to
confirm his half-awakened suspicion it is but too true that after
leading you into danger by my heedlessness i have not even the merit of
guarding your pillows as should become a soldier

no one but duncan himself should accuse duncan of such a weakness go
then and sleep believe me neither of us weak girls as we are will
betray our watch

the young man was relieved from the awkwardness of making any further
protestations of his own demerits by an exclamation from chingachgook
and the attitude of riveted attention assumed by his son

the mohicans hear an enemy whispered hawkeye who by this time in
common with the whole party was awake and stirring they scent danger
in the wind

god forbid exclaimed heyward surely we have had enough of
bloodshed

while he spoke however the young soldier seized his rifle and
advancing toward the front prepared to atone for his venial remissness
by freely exposing his life in defense of those he attended

tis some creature of the forest prowling around us in quest of food
he said in a whisper as soon as the low and apparently distant
sounds which had startled the mohicans reached his own ears

hist returned the attentive scout tis man even i can now tell
his tread poor as my senses are when compared to an indian's that
scampering huron has fallen in with one of montcalm's outlying parties
and they have struck upon our trail i shouldn't like myself to spill
more human blood in this spot he added looking around with anxiety in
his features at the dim objects by which he was surrounded but what
must be must lead the horses into the blockhouse uncas and friends
do you follow to the same shelter poor and old as it is it offers a
cover and has rung with the crack of a rifle afore to-night

he was instantly obeyed the mohicans leading the narrangansetts
within the ruin whither the whole party repaired with the most guarded
silence

the sound of approaching footsteps were now too distinctly audible to
leave any doubts as to the nature of the interruption they were soon
mingled with voices calling to each other in an indian dialect which
the hunter in a whisper affirmed to heyward was the language of the
hurons when the party reached the point where the horses had entered
the thicket which surrounded the blockhouse they were evidently at
fault having lost those marks which until that moment had directed
their pursuit

it would seem by the voices that twenty men were soon collected at that
one spot mingling their different opinions and advice in noisy clamor

the knaves know our weakness whispered hawkeye who stood by the side
of heyward in deep shade looking through an opening in the logs or
they wouldn't indulge their idleness in such a squaw's march listen to
the reptiles each man among them seems to have two tongues and but a
single leg

duncan brave as he was in the combat could not in such a moment of
painful suspense make any reply to the cool and characteristic remark
of the scout he only grasped his rifle more firmly and fastened his
eyes upon the narrow opening through which he gazed upon the moonlight
view with increasing anxiety the deeper tones of one who spoke as
having authority were next heard amid a silence that denoted the
respect with which his orders or rather advice was received after
which by the rustling of leaves and crackling of dried twigs it
was apparent the savages were separating in pursuit of the lost trail
fortunately for the pursued the light of the moon while it shed a
flood of mild luster upon the little area around the ruin was not
sufficiently strong to penetrate the deep arches of the forest where
the objects still lay in deceptive shadow the search proved fruitless
for so short and sudden had been the passage from the faint path the
travelers had journeyed into the thicket that every trace of their
footsteps was lost in the obscurity of the woods

it was not long however before the restless savages were heard beating
the brush and gradually approaching the inner edge of that dense border
of young chestnuts which encircled the little area

they are coming muttered heyward endeavoring to thrust his rifle
through the chink in the logs let us fire on their approach

keep everything in the shade returned the scout the snapping of
a flint or even the smell of a single karnel of the brimstone would
bring the hungry varlets upon us in a body should it please god that we
must give battle for the scalps trust to the experience of men who
know the ways of the savages and who are not often backward when the
war-whoop is howled

duncan cast his eyes behind him and saw that the trembling sisters were
cowering in the far corner of the building while the mohicans stood in
the shadow like two upright posts ready and apparently willing to
strike when the blow should be needed curbing his impatience he again
looked out upon the area and awaited the result in silence at that
instant the thicket opened and a tall and armed huron advanced a few
paces into the open space as he gazed upon the silent blockhouse the
moon fell upon his swarthy countenance and betrayed its surprise and
curiosity he made the exclamation which usually accompanies the former
emotion in an indian and calling in a low voice soon drew a companion
to his side

these children of the woods stood together for several moments pointing
at the crumbling edifice and conversing in the unintelligible language
of their tribe they then approached though with slow and cautious
steps pausing every instant to look at the building like startled deer
whose curiosity struggled powerfully with their awakened apprehensions
for the mastery the foot of one of them suddenly rested on the mound
and he stopped to examine its nature at this moment heyward observed
that the scout loosened his knife in its sheath and lowered the muzzle
of his rifle imitating these movements the young man prepared himself
for the struggle which now seemed inevitable

the savages were so near that the least motion in one of the horses or
even a breath louder than common would have betrayed the fugitives but
in discovering the character of the mound the attention of the hurons
appeared directed to a different object they spoke together and
the sounds of their voices were low and solemn as if influenced by a
reverence that was deeply blended with awe then they drew warily back
keeping their eyes riveted on the ruin as if they expected to see
the apparitions of the dead issue from its silent walls until having
reached the boundary of the area they moved slowly into the thicket and
disappeared

hawkeye dropped the breech of his rifle to the earth and drawing a
long free breath exclaimed in an audible whisper

ay they respect the dead and it has this time saved their own lives
and it may be the lives of better men too

heyward lent his attention for a single moment to his companion but
without replying he again turned toward those who just then interested
him more he heard the two hurons leave the bushes and it was soon
plain that all the pursuers were gathered about them in deep attention
to their report after a few minutes of earnest and solemn dialogue
altogether different from the noisy clamor with which they had first
collected about the spot the sounds grew fainter and more distant and
finally were lost in the depths of the forest

hawkeye waited until a signal from the listening chingachgook assured
him that every sound from the retiring party was completely swallowed by
the distance when he motioned to heyward to lead forth the horses and
to assist the sisters into their saddles the instant this was done
they issued through the broken gateway and stealing out by a direction
opposite to the one by which they entered they quitted the spot the
sisters casting furtive glances at the silent grave and crumbling ruin
as they left the soft light of the moon to bury themselves in the gloom
of the woods




chapter 

 guard qui est la
 puc paisans pauvres gens de france
 king henry vi

during the rapid movement from the blockhouse and until the party was
deeply buried in the forest each individual was too much interested in
the escape to hazard a word even in whispers the scout resumed his
post in advance though his steps after he had thrown a safe distance
between himself and his enemies were more deliberate than in their
previous march in consequence of his utter ignorance of the localities
of the surrounding woods more than once he halted to consult with his
confederates the mohicans pointing upward at the moon and examining
the barks of the trees with care in these brief pauses heyward and the
sisters listened with senses rendered doubly acute by the danger to
detect any symptoms which might announce the proximity of their foes
at such moments it seemed as if a vast range of country lay buried in
eternal sleep not the least sound arising from the forest unless it
was the distant and scarcely audible rippling of a water-course birds
beasts and man appeared to slumber alike if indeed any of the
latter were to be found in that wide tract of wilderness but the sounds
of the rivulet feeble and murmuring as they were relieved the guides
at once from no trifling embarrassment and toward it they immediately
held their way

when the banks of the little stream were gained hawkeye made another
halt and taking the moccasins from his feet he invited heyward and
gamut to follow his example he then entered the water and for near an
hour they traveled in the bed of the brook leaving no trail the
moon had already sunk into an immense pile of black clouds which lay
impending above the western horizon when they issued from the low and
devious water-course to rise again to the light and level of the sandy
but wooded plain here the scout seemed to be once more at home for he
held on this way with the certainty and diligence of a man who moved in
the security of his own knowledge the path soon became more uneven and
the travelers could plainly perceive that the mountains drew nigher to
them on each hand and that they were in truth about entering one of
their gorges suddenly hawkeye made a pause and waiting until he
was joined by the whole party he spoke though in tones so low and
cautious that they added to the solemnity of his words in the quiet
and darkness of the place

it is easy to know the pathways and to find the licks and
water-courses of the wilderness he said but who that saw this spot
could venture to say that a mighty army was at rest among yonder silent
trees and barren mountains

we are then at no great distance from william henry said heyward
advancing nigher to the scout

it is yet a long and weary path and when and where to strike it is
now our greatest difficulty see he said pointing through the trees
toward a spot where a little basin of water reflected the stars from its
placid bosom here is the bloody pond and i am on ground that i have
not only often traveled but over which i have fou't the enemy from the
rising to the setting sun

ha that sheet of dull and dreary water then is the sepulcher of the
brave men who fell in the contest i have heard it named but never have
i stood on its banks before

three battles did we make with the dutch-frenchman in a day
continued hawkeye pursuing the train of his own thoughts rather than
replying to the remark of duncan he met us hard by in our outward
march to ambush his advance and scattered us like driven deer through
the defile to the shores of horican then we rallied behind our fallen
trees and made head against him under sir william who was made sir
william for that very deed and well did we pay him for the disgrace
of the morning hundreds of frenchmen saw the sun that day for the last
time and even their leader dieskau himself fell into our hands so
cut and torn with the lead that he has gone back to his own country
unfit for further acts in war

 baron dieskau a german in the service of france a few
 years previously to the period of the tale this officer was
 defeated by sir william johnson of johnstown new york on
 the shores of lake george

twas a noble repulse exclaimed heyward in the heat of his youthful
ardor the fame of it reached us early in our southern army

ay but it did not end there i was sent by major effingham at sir
william's own bidding to outflank the french and carry the tidings
of their disaster across the portage to the fort on the hudson just
hereaway where you see the trees rise into a mountain swell i met a
party coming down to our aid and i led them where the enemy were taking
their meal little dreaming that they had not finished the bloody work
of the day

and you surprised them

if death can be a surprise to men who are thinking only of the cravings
of their appetites we gave them but little breathing time for they had
borne hard upon us in the fight of the morning and there were few in
our party who had not lost friend or relative by their hands

when all was over the dead and some say the dying were cast into
that little pond these eyes have seen its waters colored with blood as
natural water never yet flowed from the bowels of the arth

it was a convenient and i trust will prove a peaceful grave for a
soldier you have then seen much service on this frontier

ay said the scout erecting his tall person with an air of military
pride there are not many echoes among these hills that haven't rung
with the crack of my rifle nor is there the space of a square mile
atwixt horican and the river that killdeer hasn't dropped a living
body on be it an enemy or be it a brute beast as for the grave there
being as quiet as you mention it is another matter there are them
in the camp who say and think man to lie still should not be buried
while the breath is in the body and certain it is that in the hurry of
that evening the doctors had but little time to say who was living and
who was dead hist see you nothing walking on the shore of the pond

tis not probable that any are as houseless as ourselves in this dreary
forest

such as he may care but little for house or shelter and night dew can
never wet a body that passes its days in the water returned the scout
grasping the shoulder of heyward with such convulsive strength as to
make the young soldier painfully sensible how much superstitious terror
had got the mastery of a man usually so dauntless

by heaven there is a human form and it approaches stand to your
arms my friends for we know not whom we encounter

qui vive demanded a stern quick voice which sounded like a
challenge from another world issuing out of that solitary and solemn
place

what says it whispered the scout it speaks neither indian nor
english

qui vive repeated the same voice which was quickly followed by the
rattling of arms and a menacing attitude

france cried heyward advancing from the shadow of the trees to the
shore of the pond within a few yards of the sentinel

d'ou venez-vous ou allez-vous d'aussi bonne heure demanded the
grenadier in the language and with the accent of a man from old france

je viens de la decouverte et je vais me coucher

etes-vous officier du roi

sans doute mon camarade me prends-tu pour un provincial je suis
capitaine de chasseurs heyward well knew that the other was of a
regiment in the line j'ai ici avec moi les filles du commandant
de la fortification aha tu en as entendu parler je les ai fait
prisonnieres pres de l'autre fort et je les conduis au general

ma foi mesdames j'en suis fâche pour vous exclaimed the young
soldier touching his cap with grace mais fortune de guerre vous
trouverez notre general un brave homme et bien poli avec les dames

c'est le caractere des gens de guerre said cora with admirable
self-possession adieu mon ami je vous souhaiterais un devoir plus
agreable a remplir

the soldier made a low and humble acknowledgment for her civility and
heyward adding a bonne nuit mon camarade they moved deliberately
forward leaving the sentinel pacing the banks of the silent pond
little suspecting an enemy of so much effrontery and humming to himself
those words which were recalled to his mind by the sight of women and
perhaps by recollections of his own distant and beautiful france vive
le vin vive l'amour etc etc

tis well you understood the knave whispered the scout when they had
gained a little distance from the place and letting his rifle fall into
the hollow of his arm again i soon saw that he was one of them uneasy
frenchers and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his
wishes kind or a place might have been found for his bones among those
of his countrymen

he was interrupted by a long and heavy groan which arose from the little
basin as though in truth the spirits of the departed lingered about
their watery sepulcher

surely it was of flesh continued the scout no spirit could handle
its arms so steadily

it was of flesh but whether the poor fellow still belongs to this
world may well be doubted said heyward glancing his eyes around him
and missing chingachgook from their little band another groan more
faint than the former was succeeded by a heavy and sullen plunge into
the water and all was still again as if the borders of the dreary pool
had never been awakened from the silence of creation while they yet
hesitated in uncertainty the form of the indian was seen gliding out of
the thicket as the chief rejoined them with one hand he attached the
reeking scalp of the unfortunate young frenchman to his girdle and with
the other he replaced the knife and tomahawk that had drunk his blood
he then took his wonted station with the air of a man who believed he
had done a deed of merit

the scout dropped one end of his rifle to the earth and leaning his
hands on the other he stood musing in profound silence then shaking
his head in a mournful manner he muttered

twould have been a cruel and an unhuman act for a white-skin but tis
the gift and natur of an indian and i suppose it should not be denied
i could wish though it had befallen an accursed mingo rather than
that gay young boy from the old countries

enough said heyward apprehensive the unconscious sisters might
comprehend the nature of the detention and conquering his disgust by a
train of reflections very much like that of the hunter tis done and
though better it were left undone cannot be amended you see we are
too obviously within the sentinels of the enemy what course do you
propose to follow

yes said hawkeye rousing himself again tis as you say too late
to harbor further thoughts about it ay the french have gathered around
the fort in good earnest and we have a delicate needle to thread in
passing them

and but little time to do it in added heyward glancing his eyes
upwards toward the bank of vapor that concealed the setting moon

and little time to do it in repeated the scout the thing may be
done in two fashions by the help of providence without which it may
not be done at all

name them quickly for time presses

one would be to dismount the gentle ones and let their beasts range
the plain by sending the mohicans in front we might then cut a lane
through their sentries and enter the fort over the dead bodies

it will not do it will not do interrupted the generous heyward
a soldier might force his way in this manner but never with such a
convoy

twould be indeed a bloody path for such tender feet to wade in
returned the equally reluctant scout but i thought it befitting my
manhood to name it we must then turn in our trail and get without the
line of their lookouts when we will bend short to the west and enter
the mountains where i can hide you so that all the devil's hounds in
montcalm's pay would be thrown off the scent for months to come

let it be done and that instantly

further words were unnecessary for hawkeye merely uttering the mandate
to follow moved along the route by which they had just entered their
present critical and even dangerous situation their progress like
their late dialogue was guarded and without noise for none knew at
what moment a passing patrol or a crouching picket of the enemy might
rise upon their path as they held their silent way along the margin
of the pond again heyward and the scout stole furtive glances at its
appalling dreariness they looked in vain for the form they had so
recently seen stalking along in silent shores while a low and regular
wash of the little waves by announcing that the waters were not yet
subsided furnished a frightful memorial of the deed of blood they had
just witnessed like all that passing and gloomy scene the low basin
however quickly melted in the darkness and became blended with the
mass of black objects in the rear of the travelers

hawkeye soon deviated from the line of their retreat and striking off
towards the mountains which form the western boundary of the narrow
plain he led his followers with swift steps deep within the shadows
that were cast from their high and broken summits the route was now
painful lying over ground ragged with rocks and intersected with
ravines and their progress proportionately slow bleak and black
hills lay on every side of them compensating in some degree for the
additional toil of the march by the sense of security they imparted at
length the party began slowly to rise a steep and rugged ascent by a
path that curiously wound among rocks and trees avoiding the one and
supported by the other in a manner that showed it had been devised by
men long practised in the arts of the wilderness as they gradually rose
from the level of the valleys the thick darkness which usually precedes
the approach of day began to disperse and objects were seen in the
plain and palpable colors with which they had been gifted by nature
when they issued from the stunted woods which clung to the barren sides
of the mountain upon a flat and mossy rock that formed its summit they
met the morning as it came blushing above the green pines of a hill
that lay on the opposite side of the valley of the horican

the scout now told the sisters to dismount and taking the bridles from
the mouths and the saddles off the backs of the jaded beasts he turned
them loose to glean a scanty subsistence among the shrubs and meager
herbage of that elevated region

go he said and seek your food where natur gives it to you and
beware that you become not food to ravenous wolves yourselves among
these hills

have we no further need of them demanded heyward

see and judge with your own eyes said the scout advancing toward
the eastern brow of the mountain whither he beckoned for the whole
party to follow if it was as easy to look into the heart of man as
it is to spy out the nakedness of montcalm's camp from this spot
hypocrites would grow scarce and the cunning of a mingo might prove a
losing game compared to the honesty of a delaware

when the travelers reached the verge of the precipices they saw at
a glance the truth of the scout's declaration and the admirable
foresight with which he had led them to their commanding station

the mountain on which they stood elevated perhaps a thousand feet in
the air was a high cone that rose a little in advance of that range
which stretches for miles along the western shores of the lake until
meeting its sisters miles beyond the water it ran off toward the
canadas in confused and broken masses of rock thinly sprinkled with
evergreens immediately at the feet of the party the southern shore
of the horican swept in a broad semicircle from mountain to mountain
marking a wide strand that soon rose into an uneven and somewhat
elevated plain to the north stretched the limpid and as it appeared
from that dizzy height the narrow sheet of the holy lake indented
with numberless bays embellished by fantastic headlands and dotted
with countless islands at the distance of a few leagues the bed of the
water became lost among mountains or was wrapped in the masses of vapor
that came slowly rolling along their bosom before a light morning air
but a narrow opening between the crests of the hills pointed out the
passage by which they found their way still further north to spread
their pure and ample sheets again before pouring out their tribute
into the distant champlain to the south stretched the defile or rather
broken plain so often mentioned for several miles in this direction
the mountains appeared reluctant to yield their dominion but within
reach of the eye they diverged and finally melted into the level and
sandy lands across which we have accompanied our adventurers in their
double journey along both ranges of hills which bounded the opposite
sides of the lake and valley clouds of light vapor were rising in
spiral wreaths from the uninhabited woods looking like the smoke of
hidden cottages or rolled lazily down the declivities to mingle with
the fogs of the lower land a single solitary snow-white cloud floated
above the valley and marked the spot beneath which lay the silent pool
of the bloody pond

directly on the shore of the lake and nearer to its western than to its
eastern margin lay the extensive earthen ramparts and low buildings
of william henry two of the sweeping bastions appeared to rest on
the water which washed their bases while a deep ditch and extensive
morasses guarded its other sides and angles the land had been cleared
of wood for a reasonable distance around the work but every other part
of the scene lay in the green livery of nature except where the limpid
water mellowed the view or the bold rocks thrust their black and naked
heads above the undulating outline of the mountain ranges in its front
might be seen the scattered sentinels who held a weary watch against
their numerous foes and within the walls themselves the travelers
looked down upon men still drowsy with a night of vigilance toward the
southeast but in immediate contact with the fort was an entrenched
camp posted on a rocky eminence that would have been far more eligible
for the work itself in which hawkeye pointed out the presence of
those auxiliary regiments that had so recently left the hudson in their
company from the woods a little further to the south rose numerous
dark and lurid smokes that were easily to be distinguished from the
purer exhalations of the springs and which the scout also showed to
heyward as evidences that the enemy lay in force in that direction

but the spectacle which most concerned the young soldier was on the
western bank of the lake though quite near to its southern termination
on a strip of land which appeared from his stand too narrow to contain
such an army but which in truth extended many hundreds of yards from
the shores of the horican to the base of the mountain were to be seen
the white tents and military engines of an encampment of ten thousand
men batteries were already thrown up in their front and even while the
spectators above them were looking down with such different emotions
on a scene which lay like a map beneath their feet the roar of
artillery rose from the valley and passed off in thundering echoes
along the eastern hills

morning is just touching them below said the deliberate and musing
scout and the watchers have a mind to wake up the sleepers by the
sound of cannon we are a few hours too late montcalm has already
filled the woods with his accursed iroquois

the place is indeed invested returned duncan but is there no
expedient by which we may enter capture in the works would be far
preferable to falling again into the hands of roving indians

see exclaimed the scout unconsciously directing the attention of
cora to the quarters of her own father how that shot has made the
stones fly from the side of the commandant's house ay these frenchers
will pull it to pieces faster than it was put together solid and thick
though it be

heyward i sicken at the sight of danger that i cannot share said
the undaunted but anxious daughter let us go to montcalm and demand
admission he dare not deny a child the boon

you would scarce find the tent of the frenchman with the hair on your
head said the blunt scout if i had but one of the thousand boats
which lie empty along that shore it might be done ha here will soon
be an end of the firing for yonder comes a fog that will turn day to
night and make an indian arrow more dangerous than a molded cannon
now if you are equal to the work and will follow i will make a push
for i long to get down into that camp if it be only to scatter some
mingo dogs that i see lurking in the skirts of yonder thicket of birch

we are equal said cora firmly on such an errand we will follow to
any danger

the scout turned to her with a smile of honest and cordial approbation
as he answered

i would i had a thousand men of brawny limbs and quick eyes that
feared death as little as you i'd send them jabbering frenchers back
into their den again afore the week was ended howling like so many
fettered hounds or hungry wolves but sir he added turning from her
to the rest of the party the fog comes rolling down so fast we shall
have but just the time to meet it on the plain and use it as a cover
remember if any accident should befall me to keep the air blowing on
your left cheeks or rather follow the mohicans they'd scent their
way be it in day or be it at night

he then waved his hand for them to follow and threw himself down the
steep declivity with free but careful footsteps heyward assisted
the sisters to descend and in a few minutes they were all far down a
mountain whose sides they had climbed with so much toil and pain

the direction taken by hawkeye soon brought the travelers to the level
of the plain nearly opposite to a sally-port in the western curtain of
the fort which lay itself at the distance of about half a mile from
the point where he halted to allow duncan to come up with his charge
in their eagerness and favored by the nature of the ground they had
anticipated the fog which was rolling heavily down the lake and it
became necessary to pause until the mists had wrapped the camp of the
enemy in their fleecy mantle the mohicans profited by the delay to
steal out of the woods and to make a survey of surrounding objects
they were followed at a little distance by the scout with a view to
profit early by their report and to obtain some faint knowledge for
himself of the more immediate localities

in a very few moments he returned his face reddened with vexation
while he muttered his disappointment in words of no very gentle import

here has the cunning frenchman been posting a picket directly in our
path he said red-skins and whites and we shall be as likely to fall
into their midst as to pass them in the fog

cannot we make a circuit to avoid the danger asked heyward and come
into our path again when it is passed

who that once bends from the line of his march in a fog can tell when
or how to find it again the mists of horican are not like the curls
from a peace-pipe or the smoke which settles above a mosquito fire

he was yet speaking when a crashing sound was heard and a cannon-ball
entered the thicket striking the body of a sapling and rebounding to
the earth its force being much expended by previous resistance
the indians followed instantly like busy attendants on the terrible
messenger and uncas commenced speaking earnestly and with much action
in the delaware tongue

it may be so lad muttered the scout when he had ended for
desperate fevers are not to be treated like a toothache come then the
fog is shutting in

stop cried heyward first explain your expectations

tis soon done and a small hope it is but it is better than nothing
this shot that you see added the scout kicking the harmless iron with
his foot has plowed the arth in its road from the fort and we shall
hunt for the furrow it has made when all other signs may fail no more
words but follow or the fog may leave us in the middle of our path a
mark for both armies to shoot at

heyward perceiving that in fact a crisis had arrived when acts were
more required than words placed himself between the sisters and drew
them swiftly forward keeping the dim figure of their leader in his eye
it was soon apparent that hawkeye had not magnified the power of the
fog for before they had proceeded twenty yards it was difficult for
the different individuals of the party to distinguish each other in the
vapor

they had made their little circuit to the left and were already
inclining again toward the right having as heyward thought got over
nearly half the distance to the friendly works when his ears were
saluted with the fierce summons apparently within twenty feet of them
of

qui va la

push on whispered the scout once more bending to the left

push on repeated heyward when the summons was renewed by a dozen
voices each of which seemed charged with menace

c'est moi cried duncan dragging rather than leading those he
supported swiftly onward

bete qui moi

ami de la france

tu m'as plus l'air d'un ennemi de la france arrete ou pardieu je te
ferai ami du diable non feu camarades feu

the order was instantly obeyed and the fog was stirred by the explosion
of fifty muskets happily the aim was bad and the bullets cut the
air in a direction a little different from that taken by the fugitives
though still so nigh them that to the unpractised ears of david and the
two females it appeared as if they whistled within a few inches of the
organs the outcry was renewed and the order not only to fire again
but to pursue was too plainly audible when heyward briefly explained
the meaning of the words they heard hawkeye halted and spoke with quick
decision and great firmness

let us deliver our fire he said they will believe it a sortie and
give way or they will wait for reinforcements

the scheme was well conceived but failed in its effects the instant
the french heard the pieces it seemed as if the plain was alive with
men muskets rattling along its whole extent from the shores of the
lake to the furthest boundary of the woods

we shall draw their entire army upon us and bring on a general
assault said duncan lead on my friend for your own life and ours

the scout seemed willing to comply but in the hurry of the moment and
in the change of position he had lost the direction in vain he turned
either cheek toward the light air they felt equally cool in this
dilemma uncas lighted on the furrow of the cannon ball where it had
cut the ground in three adjacent ant-hills

give me the range said hawkeye bending to catch a glimpse of the
direction and then instantly moving onward

cries oaths voices calling to each other and the reports of muskets
were now quick and incessant and apparently on every side of them
suddenly a strong glare of light flashed across the scene the fog
rolled upward in thick wreaths and several cannons belched across the
plain and the roar was thrown heavily back from the bellowing echoes of
the mountain

tis from the fort exclaimed hawkeye turning short on his tracks
and we like stricken fools were rushing to the woods under the very
knives of the maquas

the instant their mistake was rectified the whole party retraced the
error with the utmost diligence duncan willingly relinquished the
support of cora to the arm of uncas and cora as readily accepted the
welcome assistance men hot and angry in pursuit were evidently on
their footsteps and each instant threatened their capture if not their
destruction

point de quartier aux coquins cried an eager pursuer who seemed to
direct the operations of the enemy

stand firm and be ready my gallant sixtieths suddenly exclaimed
a voice above them wait to see the enemy fire low and sweep the
glacis

father father exclaimed a piercing cry from out the mist it is i
alice thy own elsie spare oh save your daughters

hold shouted the former speaker in the awful tones of parental
agony the sound reaching even to the woods and rolling back in solemn
echo tis she god has restored me to my children throw open the
sally-port to the field sixtieths to the field pull not a trigger
lest ye kill my lambs drive off these dogs of france with your steel

duncan heard the grating of the rusty hinges and darting to the spot
directed by the sound he met a long line of dark red warriors passing
swiftly toward the glacis he knew them for his own battalion of the
royal americans and flying to their head soon swept every trace of his
pursuers from before the works

for an instant cora and alice had stood trembling and bewildered by
this unexpected desertion but before either had leisure for speech or
even thought an officer of gigantic frame whose locks were bleached
with years and service but whose air of military grandeur had been
rather softened than destroyed by time rushed out of the body of mist
and folded them to his bosom while large scalding tears rolled down his
pale and wrinkled cheeks and he exclaimed in the peculiar accent of
scotland

for this i thank thee lord let danger come as it will thy servant is
now prepared




chapter 

 then go we in to know his embassy
 which i could with ready guess declare
 before the frenchmen speak a word of it
 king henry v

a few succeeding days were passed amid the privations the uproar
and the dangers of the siege which was vigorously pressed by a
power against whose approaches munro possessed no competent means of
resistance it appeared as if webb with his army which lay slumbering
on the banks of the hudson had utterly forgotten the strait to which
his countrymen were reduced montcalm had filled the woods of the
portage with his savages every yell and whoop from whom rang through
the british encampment chilling the hearts of men who were already but
too much disposed to magnify the danger

not so however with the besieged animated by the words and
stimulated by the examples of their leaders they had found their
courage and maintained their ancient reputation with a zeal that did
justice to the stern character of their commander as if satisfied with
the toil of marching through the wilderness to encounter his enemy the
french general though of approved skill had neglected to seize the
adjacent mountains whence the besieged might have been exterminated
with impunity and which in the more modern warfare of the country
would not have been neglected for a single hour this sort of contempt
for eminences or rather dread of the labor of ascending them might
have been termed the besetting weakness of the warfare of the period it
originated in the simplicity of the indian contests in which from the
nature of the combats and the density of the forests fortresses were
rare and artillery next to useless the carelessness engendered by
these usages descended even to the war of the revolution and lost the
states the important fortress of ticonderoga opening a way for the army
of burgoyne into what was then the bosom of the country we look back at
this ignorance or infatuation whichever it may be called with wonder
knowing that the neglect of an eminence whose difficulties like those
of mount defiance have been so greatly exaggerated would at the
present time prove fatal to the reputation of the engineer who had
planned the works at their base or to that of the general whose lot it
was to defend them

the tourist the valetudinarian or the amateur of the beauties of
nature who in the train of his four-in-hand now rolls through the
scenes we have attempted to describe in quest of information health
or pleasure or floats steadily toward his object on those artificial
waters which have sprung up under the administration of a statesman who
has dared to stake his political character on the hazardous issue is
not to suppose that his ancestors traversed those hills or struggled
with the same currents with equal facility the transportation of a
single heavy gun was often considered equal to a victory gained if
happily the difficulties of the passage had not so far separated it
from its necessary concomitant the ammunition as to render it no more
than a useless tube of unwieldy iron

 evidently the late de witt clinton who died governor of
 new york in 

the evils of this state of things pressed heavily on the fortunes of the
resolute scotsman who now defended william henry though his adversary
neglected the hills he had planted his batteries with judgment on the
plain and caused them to be served with vigor and skill against
this assault the besieged could only oppose the imperfect and hasty
preparations of a fortress in the wilderness

it was in the afternoon of the fifth day of the siege and the fourth of
his own service in it that major heyward profited by a parley that
had just been beaten by repairing to the ramparts of one of the water
bastions to breathe the cool air from the lake and to take a survey
of the progress of the siege he was alone if the solitary sentinel who
paced the mound be excepted for the artillerists had hastened also to
profit by the temporary suspension of their arduous duties the evening
was delightfully calm and the light air from the limpid water fresh and
soothing it seemed as if with the termination of the roar of artillery
and the plunging of shot nature had also seized the moment to assume
her mildest and most captivating form the sun poured down his parting
glory on the scene without the oppression of those fierce rays that
belong to the climate and the season the mountains looked green
and fresh and lovely tempered with the milder light or softened in
shadow as thin vapors floated between them and the sun the numerous
islands rested on the bosom of the horican some low and sunken as if
embedded in the waters and others appearing to hover about the element
in little hillocks of green velvet among which the fishermen of the
beleaguering army peacefully rowed their skiffs or floated at rest on
the glassy mirror in quiet pursuit of their employment

the scene was at once animated and still all that pertained to nature
was sweet or simply grand while those parts which depended on the
temper and movements of man were lively and playful

two little spotless flags were abroad the one on a salient angle of the
fort and the other on the advanced battery of the besiegers emblems of
the truth which existed not only to the acts but it would seem also
to the enmity of the combatants

behind these again swung heavily opening and closing in silken folds
the rival standards of england and france

a hundred gay and thoughtless young frenchmen were drawing a net to the
pebbly beach within dangerous proximity to the sullen but silent cannon
of the fort while the eastern mountain was sending back the loud shouts
and gay merriment that attended their sport some were rushing eagerly
to enjoy the aquatic games of the lake and others were already toiling
their way up the neighboring hills with the restless curiosity of their
nation to all these sports and pursuits those of the enemy who watched
the besieged and the besieged themselves were however merely the
idle though sympathizing spectators here and there a picket had
indeed raised a song or mingled in a dance which had drawn the
dusky savages around them from their lairs in the forest in short
everything wore rather the appearance of a day of pleasure than of
an hour stolen from the dangers and toil of a bloody and vindictive
warfare

duncan had stood in a musing attitude contemplating this scene a few
minutes when his eyes were directed to the glacis in front of the
sally-port already mentioned by the sounds of approaching footsteps he
walked to an angle of the bastion and beheld the scout advancing
under the custody of a french officer to the body of the fort the
countenance of hawkeye was haggard and careworn and his air dejected
as though he felt the deepest degradation at having fallen into the
power of his enemies he was without his favorite weapon and his arms
were even bound behind him with thongs made of the skin of a deer the
arrival of flags to cover the messengers of summons had occurred so
often of late that when heyward first threw his careless glance on this
group he expected to see another of the officers of the enemy charged
with a similar office but the instant he recognized the tall person and
still sturdy though downcast features of his friend the woodsman he
started with surprise and turned to descend from the bastion into the
bosom of the work

the sounds of other voices however caught his attention and for a
moment caused him to forget his purpose at the inner angle of the mound
he met the sisters walking along the parapet in search like himself
of air and relief from confinement they had not met from that painful
moment when he deserted them on the plain only to assure their safety
he had parted from them worn with care and jaded with fatigue he now
saw them refreshed and blooming though timid and anxious under such an
inducement it will cause no surprise that the young man lost sight for
a time of other objects in order to address them he was however
anticipated by the voice of the ingenuous and youthful alice

ah thou tyrant thou recreant knight he who abandons his damsels
in the very lists she cried here have we been days nay ages
expecting you at our feet imploring mercy and forgetfulness of your
craven backsliding or i should rather say backrunning for verily you
fled in the manner that no stricken deer as our worthy friend the scout
would say could equal

you know that alice means our thanks and our blessings added the
graver and more thoughtful cora in truth we have a little wonder why
you should so rigidly absent yourself from a place where the gratitude
of the daughters might receive the support of a parent's thanks

your father himself could tell you that though absent from your
presence i have not been altogether forgetful of your safety returned
the young man the mastery of yonder village of huts pointing to the
neighboring entrenched camp has been keenly disputed and he who holds
it is sure to be possessed of this fort and that which it contains my
days and nights have all been passed there since we separated because
i thought that duty called me thither but he added with an air of
chagrin which he endeavored though unsuccessfully to conceal had
i been aware that what i then believed a soldier's conduct could be so
construed shame would have been added to the list of reasons

heyward duncan exclaimed alice bending forward to read his
half-averted countenance until a lock of her golden hair rested on her
flushed cheek and nearly concealed the tear that had started to her
eye did i think this idle tongue of mine had pained you i would
silence it forever cora can say if cora would how justly we have
prized your services and how deep i had almost said how fervent is
our gratitude

and will cora attest the truth of this cried duncan suffering the
cloud to be chased from his countenance by a smile of open pleasure
what says our graver sister will she find an excuse for the neglect of
the knight in the duty of a soldier

cora made no immediate answer but turned her face toward the water as
if looking on the sheet of the horican when she did bend her dark eyes
on the young man they were yet filled with an expression of anguish
that at once drove every thought but that of kind solicitude from his
mind

you are not well dearest miss munro he exclaimed we have trifled
while you are in suffering

tis nothing she answered refusing his support with feminine
reserve that i cannot see the sunny side of the picture of life like
this artless but ardent enthusiast she added laying her hand lightly
but affectionately on the arm of her sister is the penalty of
experience and perhaps the misfortune of my nature see she
continued as if determined to shake off infirmity in a sense of duty
look around you major heyward and tell me what a prospect is this for
the daughter of a soldier whose greatest happiness is his honor and his
military renown

neither ought nor shall be tarnished by circumstances over which he has
had no control duncan warmly replied but your words recall me to my
own duty i go now to your gallant father to hear his determination
in matters of the last moment to the defense god bless you in every
fortune noble cora i may and must call you she frankly gave him her
hand though her lip quivered and her cheeks gradually became of ashly
paleness in every fortune i know you will be an ornament and honor
to your sex alice adieu his voice changed from admiration to
tenderness adieu alice we shall soon meet again as conquerors i
trust and amid rejoicings

without waiting for an answer from either the young man threw himself
down the grassy steps of the bastion and moving rapidly across the
parade he was quickly in the presence of their father munro was pacing
his narrow apartment with a disturbed air and gigantic strides as duncan
entered

you have anticipated my wishes major heyward he said i was about
to request this favor

i am sorry to see sir that the messenger i so warmly recommended has
returned in custody of the french i hope there is no reason to distrust
his fidelity

the fidelity of the long rifle is well known to me returned munro
and is above suspicion though his usual good fortune seems at last
to have failed montcalm has got him and with the accursed politeness
of his nation he has sent him in with a doleful tale of knowing how
i valued the fellow he could not think of retaining him a jesuitical
way that major duncan heyward of telling a man of his misfortunes

but the general and his succor

did ye look to the south as ye entered and could ye not see them
said the old soldier laughing bitterly

hoot hoot you're an impatient boy sir and cannot give the gentlemen
leisure for their march

they are coming then the scout has said as much

when and by what path for the dunce has omitted to tell me this
there is a letter it would seem too and that is the only agreeable
part of the matter for the customary attentions of your marquis of
montcalm i warrant me duncan that he of lothian would buy a dozen
such marquisates but if the news of the letter were bad the gentility
of this french monsieur would certainly compel him to let us know it

he keeps the letter then while he releases the messenger

ay that does he and all for the sake of what you call your
bonhommie i would venture if the truth was known the fellow's
grandfather taught the noble science of dancing

but what says the scout he has eyes and ears and a tongue what
verbal report does he make

oh sir he is not wanting in natural organs and he is free to tell
all that he has seen and heard the whole amount is this there is a
fort of his majesty's on the banks of the hudson called edward in
honor of his gracious highness of york you'll know and it is well
filled with armed men as such a work should be

but was there no movement no signs of any intention to advance to our
relief

there were the morning and evening parades and when one of the
provincial loons you'll know duncan you're half a scotsman
yourself when one of them dropped his powder over his porretch if it
touched the coals it just burned then suddenly changing his bitter
ironical manner to one more grave and thoughtful he continued and
yet there might and must be something in that letter which it would be
well to know

our decision should be speedy said duncan gladly availing himself
of this change of humor to press the more important objects of their
interview i cannot conceal from you sir that the camp will not be
much longer tenable and i am sorry to add that things appear no better
in the fort more than half the guns are bursted

and how should it be otherwise some were fished from the bottom of
the lake some have been rusting in woods since the discovery of
the country and some were never guns at all mere privateersmen's
playthings do you think sir you can have woolwich warren in the midst
of a wilderness three thousand miles from great britain

the walls are crumbling about our ears and provisions begin to fail
us continued heyward without regarding the new burst of indignation
even the men show signs of discontent and alarm

major heyward said munro turning to his youthful associate with
the dignity of his years and superior rank i should have served his
majesty for half a century and earned these gray hairs in vain were
i ignorant of all you say and of the pressing nature of our
circumstances still there is everything due to the honor of the king's
arms and something to ourselves while there is hope of succor this
fortress will i defend though it be to be done with pebbles gathered
on the lake shore it is a sight of the letter therefore that we want
that we may know the intentions of the man the earl of loudon has left
among us as his substitute

and can i be of service in the matter

sir you can the marquis of montcalm has in addition to his other
civilities invited me to a personal interview between the works and his
own camp in order as he says to impart some additional information
now i think it would not be wise to show any undue solicitude to meet
him and i would employ you an officer of rank as my substitute for
it would but ill comport with the honor of scotland to let it be said
one of her gentlemen was outdone in civility by a native of any other
country on earth

without assuming the supererogatory task of entering into a discussion
of the comparative merits of national courtesy duncan cheerfully
assented to supply the place of the veteran in the approaching
interview a long and confidential communication now succeeded during
which the young man received some additional insight into his duty
from the experience and native acuteness of his commander and then the
former took his leave

as duncan could only act as the representative of the commandant of the
fort the ceremonies which should have accompanied a meeting between the
heads of the adverse forces were of course dispensed with the truce
still existed and with a roll and beat of the drum and covered by a
little white flag duncan left the sally-port within ten minutes after
his instructions were ended he was received by the french officer in
advance with the usual formalities and immediately accompanied to a
distant marquee of the renowned soldier who led the forces of france

the general of the enemy received the youthful messenger surrounded by
his principal officers and by a swarthy band of the native chiefs
who had followed him to the field with the warriors of their several
tribes heyward paused short when in glancing his eyes rapidly over
the dark group of the latter he beheld the malignant countenance of
magua regarding him with the calm but sullen attention which marked the
expression of that subtle savage a slight exclamation of surprise even
burst from the lips of the young man but instantly recollecting
his errand and the presence in which he stood he suppressed every
appearance of emotion and turned to the hostile leader who had already
advanced a step to receive him

the marquis of montcalm was at the period of which we write in the
flower of his age and it may be added in the zenith of his fortunes
but even in that enviable situation he was affable and distinguished
as much for his attention to the forms of courtesy as for that
chivalrous courage which only two short years afterward induced him
to throw away his life on the plains of abraham duncan in turning his
eyes from the malign expression of magua suffered them to rest with
pleasure on the smiling and polished features and the noble military
air of the french general

monsieur said the latter j'ai beaucoup de plaisir a bah ou est
cet interprete

je crois monsieur qu'il ne sear pas necessaire heyward modestly
replied je parle un peu francais

ah j'en suis bien aise said montcalm taking duncan familiarly by
the arm and leading him deep into the marquee a little out of earshot
je deteste ces fripons-la on ne sait jamais sur quel pie on est avec
eux eh bien monsieur he continued still speaking in french though
i should have been proud of receiving your commandant i am very happy
that he has seen proper to employ an officer so distinguished and who
i am sure is so amiable as yourself

duncan bowed low pleased with the compliment in spite of a most heroic
determination to suffer no artifice to allure him into forgetfulness of
the interest of his prince and montcalm after a pause of a moment as
if to collect his thoughts proceeded

your commandant is a brave man and well qualified to repel my
assault mais monsieur is it not time to begin to take more counsel
of humanity and less of your courage the one as strongly characterizes
the hero as the other

we consider the qualities as inseparable returned duncan smiling
but while we find in the vigor of your excellency every motive to
stimulate the one we can as yet see no particular call for the
exercise of the other

montcalm in his turn slightly bowed but it was with the air of a
man too practised to remember the language of flattery after musing a
moment he added

it is possible my glasses have deceived me and that your works resist
our cannon better than i had supposed you know our force

our accounts vary said duncan carelessly the highest however has
not exceeded twenty thousand men

the frenchman bit his lip and fastened his eyes keenly on the other as
if to read his thoughts then with a readiness peculiar to himself he
continued as if assenting to the truth of an enumeration which quite
doubled his army

it is a poor compliment to the vigilance of us soldiers monsieur
that do what we will we never can conceal our numbers if it were
to be done at all one would believe it might succeed in these woods
though you think it too soon to listen to the calls of humanity he
added smiling archly i may be permitted to believe that gallantry
is not forgotten by one so young as yourself the daughters of the
commandant i learn have passed into the fort since it was invested

it is true monsieur but so far from weakening our efforts they
set us an example of courage in their own fortitude were nothing
but resolution necessary to repel so accomplished a soldier as m de
montcalm i would gladly trust the defense of william henry to the elder
of those ladies

we have a wise ordinance in our salique laws which says the crown
of france shall never degrade the lance to the distaff said montcalm
dryly and with a little hauteur but instantly adding with his former
frank and easy air as all the nobler qualities are hereditary i can
easily credit you though as i said before courage has its limits and
humanity must not be forgotten i trust monsieur you come authorized
to treat for the surrender of the place

has your excellency found our defense so feeble as to believe the
measure necessary

i should be sorry to have the defense protracted in such a manner as to
irritate my red friends there continued montcalm glancing his eyes
at the group of grave and attentive indians without attending to the
other's questions i find it difficult even now to limit them to the
usages of war

heyward was silent for a painful recollection of the dangers he had so
recently escaped came over his mind and recalled the images of those
defenseless beings who had shared in all his sufferings

ces messieurs-la said montcalm following up the advantage which he
conceived he had gained are most formidable when baffled and it is
unnecessary to tell you with what difficulty they are restrained in
their anger eh bien monsieur shall we speak of the terms

i fear your excellency has been deceived as to the strength of william
henry and the resources of its garrison

i have not sat down before quebec but an earthen work that is
defended by twenty-three hundred gallant men was the laconic reply

our mounds are earthen certainly nor are they seated on the rocks of
cape diamond but they stand on that shore which proved so destructive
to dieskau and his army there is also a powerful force within a few
hours march of us which we account upon as a part of our means

some six or eight thousand men returned montcalm with much apparent
indifference whom their leader wisely judges to be safer in their
works than in the field

it was now heyward's turn to bite his lip with vexation as the other so
coolly alluded to a force which the young man knew to be overrated both
mused a little while in silence when montcalm renewed the conversation
in a way that showed he believed the visit of his guest was solely to
propose terms of capitulation on the other hand heyward began to
throw sundry inducements in the way of the french general to betray the
discoveries he had made through the intercepted letter the artifice
of neither however succeeded and after a protracted and fruitless
interview duncan took his leave favorably impressed with an opinion of
the courtesy and talents of the enemy's captain but as ignorant of what
he came to learn as when he arrived montcalm followed him as far as the
entrance of the marquee renewing his invitations to the commandant of
the fort to give him an immediate meeting in the open ground between the
two armies

there they separated and duncan returned to the advanced post of the
french accompanied as before whence he instantly proceeded to the
fort and to the quarters of his own commander




chapter 

 edg before you fight the battle ope this letter
 lear

major heyward found munro attended only by his daughters alice sat upon
his knee parting the gray hairs on the forehead of the old man with
her delicate fingers and whenever he affected to frown on her trifling
appeasing his assumed anger by pressing her ruby lips fondly on his
wrinkled brow cora was seated nigh them a calm and amused looker-on
regarding the wayward movements of her more youthful sister with that
species of maternal fondness which characterized her love for alice not
only the dangers through which they had passed but those which still
impended above them appeared to be momentarily forgotten in the
soothing indulgence of such a family meeting it seemed as if they had
profited by the short truce to devote an instant to the purest and best
affection the daughters forgetting their fears and the veteran his
cares in the security of the moment of this scene duncan who in
his eagerness to report his arrival had entered unannounced stood
many moments an unobserved and a delighted spectator but the quick and
dancing eyes of alice soon caught a glimpse of his figure reflected
from a glass and she sprang blushing from her father's knee exclaiming
aloud

major heyward

what of the lad demanded her father i have sent him to crack a
little with the frenchman ha sir you are young and you're nimble
away with you ye baggage as if there were not troubles enough for a
soldier without having his camp filled with such prattling hussies as
yourself

alice laughingly followed her sister who instantly led the way from an
apartment where she perceived their presence was no longer desirable
munro instead of demanding the result of the young man's mission paced
the room for a few moments with his hands behind his back and his
head inclined toward the floor like a man lost in thought at length he
raised his eyes glistening with a father's fondness and exclaimed

they are a pair of excellent girls heyward and such as any one may
boast of

you are not now to learn my opinion of your daughters colonel munro

true lad true interrupted the impatient old man you were about
opening your mind more fully on that matter the day you got in but i
did not think it becoming in an old soldier to be talking of nuptial
blessings and wedding jokes when the enemies of his king were likely
to be unbidden guests at the feast but i was wrong duncan boy i was
wrong there and i am now ready to hear what you have to say

notwithstanding the pleasure your assurance gives me dear sir i have
just now a message from montcalm 

let the frenchman and all his host go to the devil sir exclaimed the
hasty veteran he is not yet master of william henry nor shall he
ever be provided webb proves himself the man he should no sir thank
heaven we are not yet in such a strait that it can be said munro is too
much pressed to discharge the little domestic duties of his own family
your mother was the only child of my bosom friend duncan and i'll just
give you a hearing though all the knights of st louis were in a body
at the sally-port with the french saint at their head crying to speak
a word under favor a pretty degree of knighthood sir is that which
can be bought with sugar hogsheads and then your twopenny marquisates
the thistle is the order for dignity and antiquity the veritable
nemo me impune lacessit of chivalry ye had ancestors in that degree
duncan and they were an ornament to the nobles of scotland

heyward who perceived that his superior took a malicious pleasure in
exhibiting his contempt for the message of the french general was
fain to humor a spleen that he knew would be short-lived he therefore
replied with as much indifference as he could assume on such a subject

my request as you know sir went so far as to presume to the honor of
being your son

ay boy you found words to make yourself very plainly comprehended
but let me ask ye sir have you been as intelligible to the girl

on my honor no exclaimed duncan warmly there would have been an
abuse of a confided trust had i taken advantage of my situation for
such a purpose

your notions are those of a gentleman major heyward and well enough
in their place but cora munro is a maiden too discreet and of a mind
too elevated and improved to need the guardianship even of a father

cora

ay cora we are talking of your pretensions to miss munro are we not
sir

i i i was not conscious of having mentioned her name said duncan
stammering

and to marry whom then did you wish my consent major heyward
demanded the old soldier erecting himself in the dignity of offended
feeling

you have another and not less lovely child

alice exclaimed the father in an astonishment equal to that with
which duncan had just repeated the name of her sister

such was the direction of my wishes sir

the young man awaited in silence the result of the extraordinary
effect produced by a communication which as it now appeared was so
unexpected for several minutes munro paced the chamber with long
and rapid strides his rigid features working convulsively and every
faculty seemingly absorbed in the musings of his own mind at length he
paused directly in front of heyward and riveting his eyes upon those of
the other he said with a lip that quivered violently

duncan heyward i have loved you for the sake of him whose blood is
in your veins i have loved you for your own good qualities and i have
loved you because i thought you would contribute to the happiness of my
child but all this love would turn to hatred were i assured that what
i so much apprehend is true

god forbid that any act or thought of mine should lead to such a
change exclaimed the young man whose eye never quailed under the
penetrating look it encountered without adverting to the impossibility
of the other's comprehending those feelings which were hid in his
own bosom munro suffered himself to be appeased by the unaltered
countenance he met and with a voice sensibly softened he continued

you would be my son duncan and you're ignorant of the history of the
man you wish to call your father sit ye down young man and i will
open to you the wounds of a seared heart in as few words as may be
suitable

by this time the message of montcalm was as much forgotten by him who
bore it as by the man for whose ears it was intended each drew a chair
and while the veteran communed a few moments with his own thoughts
apparently in sadness the youth suppressed his impatience in a look and
attitude of respectful attention at length the former spoke

you'll know already major heyward that my family was both ancient
and honorable commenced the scotsman though it might not altogether
be endowed with that amount of wealth that should correspond with its
degree i was maybe such an one as yourself when i plighted my faith
to alice graham the only child of a neighboring laird of some estate
but the connection was disagreeable to her father on more accounts than
my poverty i did therefore what an honest man should restored the
maiden her troth and departed the country in the service of my king
i had seen many regions and had shed much blood in different lands
before duty called me to the islands of the west indies there it was
my lot to form a connection with one who in time became my wife and the
mother of cora she was the daughter of a gentleman of those isles by
a lady whose misfortune it was if you will said the old man proudly
to be descended remotely from that unfortunate class who are so
basely enslaved to administer to the wants of a luxurious people ay
sir that is a curse entailed on scotland by her unnatural union with a
foreign and trading people but could i find a man among them who would
dare to reflect on my child he should feel the weight of a father's
anger ha major heyward you are yourself born at the south where
these unfortunate beings are considered of a race inferior to your own

tis most unfortunately true sir said duncan unable any longer to
prevent his eyes from sinking to the floor in embarrassment

and you cast it on my child as a reproach you scorn to mingle the
blood of the heywards with one so degraded lovely and virtuous though
she be fiercely demanded the jealous parent

heaven protect me from a prejudice so unworthy of my reason returned
duncan at the same time conscious of such a feeling and that as deeply
rooted as if it had been ingrafted in his nature the sweetness the
beauty the witchery of your younger daughter colonel munro might
explain my motives without imputing to me this injustice

ye are right sir returned the old man again changing his tones to
those of gentleness or rather softness the girl is the image of what
her mother was at her years and before she had become acquainted
with grief when death deprived me of my wife i returned to scotland
enriched by the marriage and would you think it duncan the suffering
angel had remained in the heartless state of celibacy twenty long years
and that for the sake of a man who could forget her she did more
sir she overlooked my want of faith and all difficulties being now
removed she took me for her husband

and became the mother of alice exclaimed duncan with an eagerness
that might have proved dangerous at a moment when the thoughts of munro
were less occupied that at present

she did indeed said the old man and dearly did she pay for the
blessing she bestowed but she is a saint in heaven sir and it ill
becomes one whose foot rests on the grave to mourn a lot so blessed i
had her but a single year though a short term of happiness for one who
had seen her youth fade in hopeless pining

there was something so commanding in the distress of the old man that
heyward did not dare to venture a syllable of consolation munro sat
utterly unconscious of the other's presence his features exposed and
working with the anguish of his regrets while heavy tears fell from
his eyes and rolled unheeded from his cheeks to the floor at length
he moved and as if suddenly recovering his recollection when he arose
and taking a single turn across the room he approached his companion
with an air of military grandeur and demanded

have you not major heyward some communication that i should hear from
the marquis de montcalm

duncan started in his turn and immediately commenced in an embarrassed
voice the half-forgotten message it is unnecessary to dwell upon the
evasive though polite manner with which the french general had
eluded every attempt of heyward to worm from him the purport of the
communication he had proposed making or on the decided though still
polished message by which he now gave his enemy to understand that
unless he chose to receive it in person he should not receive it at
all as munro listened to the detail of duncan the excited feelings of
the father gradually gave way before the obligations of his station
and when the other was done he saw before him nothing but the veteran
swelling with the wounded feelings of a soldier

you have said enough major heyward exclaimed the angry old man
enough to make a volume of commentary on french civility here has
this gentleman invited me to a conference and when i send him a capable
substitute for ye're all that duncan though your years are but few
he answers me with a riddle

he may have thought less favorably of the substitute my dear sir and
you will remember that the invitation which he now repeats was to the
commandant of the works and not to his second

well sir is not a substitute clothed with all the power and dignity
of him who grants the commission he wishes to confer with munro faith
sir i have much inclination to indulge the man if it should only be to
let him behold the firm countenance we maintain in spite of his numbers
and his summons there might be not bad policy in such a stroke young
man

duncan who believed it of the last importance that they should speedily
come to the contents of the letter borne by the scout gladly encouraged
this idea

without doubt he could gather no confidence by witnessing our
indifference he said

you never said truer word i could wish sir that he would visit the
works in open day and in the form of a storming party that is the
least failing method of proving the countenance of an enemy and would
be far preferable to the battering system he has chosen the beauty and
manliness of warfare has been much deformed major heyward by the arts
of your monsieur vauban our ancestors were far above such scientific
cowardice

it may be very true sir but we are now obliged to repel art by art
what is your pleasure in the matter of the interview

i will meet the frenchman and that without fear or delay promptly
sir as becomes a servant of my royal master go major heyward and
give them a flourish of the music and send out a messenger to let them
know who is coming we will follow with a small guard for such respect
is due to one who holds the honor of his king in keeping and hark'ee
duncan he added in a half whisper though they were alone it may be
prudent to have some aid at hand in case there should be treachery at
the bottom of it all

the young man availed himself of this order to quit the apartment and
as the day was fast coming to a close he hastened without delay to
make the necessary arrangements a very few minutes only were necessary
to parade a few files and to dispatch an orderly with a flag to
announce the approach of the commandant of the fort when duncan had
done both these he led the guard to the sally-port near which he
found his superior ready waiting his appearance as soon as the usual
ceremonials of a military departure were observed the veteran and his
more youthful companion left the fortress attended by the escort

they had proceeded only a hundred yards from the works when the little
array which attended the french general to the conference was seen
issuing from the hollow way which formed the bed of a brook that ran
between the batteries of the besiegers and the fort from the moment
that munro left his own works to appear in front of his enemy's his
air had been grand and his step and countenance highly military the
instant he caught a glimpse of the white plume that waved in the hat
of montcalm his eye lighted and age no longer appeared to possess any
influence over his vast and still muscular person

speak to the boys to be watchful sir he said in an undertone to
duncan and to look well to their flints and steel for one is never
safe with a servant of these louis's at the same time we shall show
them the front of men in deep security ye'll understand me major
heyward

he was interrupted by the clamor of a drum from the approaching
frenchmen which was immediately answered when each party pushed an
orderly in advance bearing a white flag and the wary scotsman halted
with his guard close at his back as soon as this slight salutation
had passed montcalm moved toward them with a quick but graceful step
baring his head to the veteran and dropping his spotless plume nearly
to the earth in courtesy if the air of munro was more commanding and
manly it wanted both the ease and insinuating polish of that of the
frenchman neither spoke for a few moments each regarding the other
with curious and interested eyes then as became his superior rank and
the nature of the interview montcalm broke the silence after uttering
the usual words of greeting he turned to duncan and continued with a
smile of recognition speaking always in french

i am rejoiced monsieur that you have given us the pleasure of your
company on this occasion there will be no necessity to employ an
ordinary interpreter for in your hands i feel the same security as if
i spoke your language myself

duncan acknowledged the compliment when montcalm turning to his guard
which in imitation of that of their enemies pressed close upon him
continued

en arriere mes enfants il fait chaud -retirez-vous un peu

before major heyward would imitate this proof of confidence he glanced
his eyes around the plain and beheld with uneasiness the numerous dusky
groups of savages who looked out from the margin of the surrounding
woods curious spectators of the interview

monsieur de montcalm will readily acknowledge the difference in our
situation he said with some embarrassment pointing at the same
time toward those dangerous foes who were to be seen in almost every
direction were we to dismiss our guard we should stand here at the
mercy of our enemies

monsieur you have the plighted faith of un gentilhomme francais
for your safety returned montcalm laying his hand impressively on his
heart it should suffice

it shall fall back duncan added to the officer who led the escort
fall back sir beyond hearing and wait for orders

munro witnessed this movement with manifest uneasiness nor did he fail
to demand an instant explanation

is it not our interest sir to betray distrust retorted duncan
monsieur de montcalm pledges his word for our safety and i have
ordered the men to withdraw a little in order to prove how much we
depend on his assurance

it may be all right sir but i have no overweening reliance on the
faith of these marquesses or marquis as they call themselves their
patents of nobility are too common to be certain that they bear the seal
of true honor

you forget dear sir that we confer with an officer distinguished
alike in europe and america for his deeds from a soldier of his
reputation we can have nothing to apprehend

the old man made a gesture of resignation though his rigid features
still betrayed his obstinate adherence to a distrust which he derived
from a sort of hereditary contempt of his enemy rather than from any
present signs which might warrant so uncharitable a feeling montcalm
waited patiently until this little dialogue in demi-voice was ended
when he drew nigher and opened the subject of their conference

i have solicited this interview from your superior monsieur he said
because i believe he will allow himself to be persuaded that he has
already done everything which is necessary for the honor of his prince
and will now listen to the admonitions of humanity i will forever bear
testimony that his resistance has been gallant and was continued as
long as there was hope

when this opening was translated to munro he answered with dignity but
with sufficient courtesy

however i may prize such testimony from monsieur montcalm it will be
more valuable when it shall be better merited

the french general smiled as duncan gave him the purport of this reply
and observed

what is now so freely accorded to approved courage may be refused to
useless obstinacy monsieur would wish to see my camp and witness for
himself our numbers and the impossibility of his resisting them with
success

i know that the king of france is well served returned the unmoved
scotsman as soon as duncan ended his translation but my own royal
master has as many and as faithful troops

though not at hand fortunately for us said montcalm without
waiting in his ardor for the interpreter there is a destiny in war
to which a brave man knows how to submit with the same courage that he
faces his foes

had i been conscious that monsieur montcalm was master of the english
i should have spared myself the trouble of so awkward a translation
said the vexed duncan dryly remembering instantly his recent by-play
with munro

your pardon monsieur rejoined the frenchman suffering a slight
color to appear on his dark cheek there is a vast difference between
understanding and speaking a foreign tongue you will therefore please
to assist me still then after a short pause he added these hills
afford us every opportunity of reconnoitering your works messieurs and
i am possibly as well acquainted with their weak condition as you can be
yourselves

ask the french general if his glasses can reach to the hudson said
munro proudly and if he knows when and where to expect the army of
webb

let general webb be his own interpreter returned the politic
montcalm suddenly extending an open letter toward munro as he spoke
you will there learn monsieur that his movements are not likely to
prove embarrassing to my army

the veteran seized the offered paper without waiting for duncan to
translate the speech and with an eagerness that betrayed how important
he deemed its contents as his eye passed hastily over the words his
countenance changed from its look of military pride to one of deep
chagrin his lip began to quiver and suffering the paper to fall from
his hand his head dropped upon his chest like that of a man whose
hopes were withered at a single blow duncan caught the letter from the
ground and without apology for the liberty he took he read at a glance
its cruel purport their common superior so far from encouraging them
to resist advised a speedy surrender urging in the plainest language
as a reason the utter impossibility of his sending a single man to
their rescue

here is no deception exclaimed duncan examining the billet both
inside and out this is the signature of webb and must be the captured
letter

the man has betrayed me munro at length bitterly exclaimed he has
brought dishonor to the door of one where disgrace was never before
known to dwell and shame has he heaped heavily on my gray hairs

say not so cried duncan we are yet masters of the fort and of our
honor let us then sell our lives at such a rate as shall make our
enemies believe the purchase too dear

boy i thank thee exclaimed the old man rousing himself from his
stupor you have for once reminded munro of his duty we will go
back and dig our graves behind those ramparts

messieurs said montcalm advancing toward them a step in generous
interest you little know louis de st veran if you believe him capable
of profiting by this letter to humble brave men or to build up a
dishonest reputation for himself listen to my terms before you leave
me

what says the frenchman demanded the veteran sternly does he make
a merit of having captured a scout with a note from headquarters sir
he had better raise this siege to go and sit down before edward if he
wishes to frighten his enemy with words

duncan explained the other's meaning

monsieur de montcalm we will hear you the veteran added more
calmly as duncan ended

to retain the fort is now impossible said his liberal enemy it is
necessary to the interests of my master that it should be destroyed but
as for yourselves and your brave comrades there is no privilege dear to
a soldier that shall be denied

our colors demanded heyward

carry them to england and show them to your king

our arms

keep them none can use them better

our march the surrender of the place

shall all be done in a way most honorable to yourselves

duncan now turned to explain these proposals to his commander who heard
him with amazement and a sensibility that was deeply touched by so
unusual and unexpected generosity

go you duncan he said go with this marquess as indeed marquess
he should be go to his marquee and arrange it all i have lived to
see two things in my old age that never did i expect to behold an
englishman afraid to support a friend and a frenchman too honest to
profit by his advantage

so saying the veteran again dropped his head to his chest and returned
slowly toward the fort exhibiting by the dejection of his air to the
anxious garrison a harbinger of evil tidings

from the shock of this unexpected blow the haughty feelings of munro
never recovered but from that moment there commenced a change in his
determined character which accompanied him to a speedy grave duncan
remained to settle the terms of the capitulation he was seen
to re-enter the works during the first watches of the night and
immediately after a private conference with the commandant to
leave them again it was then openly announced that hostilities must
cease munro having signed a treaty by which the place was to be yielded
to the enemy with the morning the garrison to retain their arms
the colors and their baggage and consequently according to military
opinion their honor




chapter 

 weave we the woof
 the thread is spun
 the web is wove
 the work is done gray

the hostile armies which lay in the wilds of the horican passed the
night of the ninth of august much in the manner they would had
they encountered on the fairest field of europe while the conquered
were still sullen and dejected the victors triumphed but there
are limits alike to grief and joy and long before the watches of the
morning came the stillness of those boundless woods was only broken by a
gay call from some exulting young frenchman of the advanced pickets or
a menacing challenge from the fort which sternly forbade the approach
of any hostile footsteps before the stipulated moment even these
occasional threatening sounds ceased to be heard in that dull hour which
precedes the day at which period a listener might have sought in vain
any evidence of the presence of those armed powers that then slumbered
on the shores of the holy lake

it was during these moments of deep silence that the canvas which
concealed the entrance to a spacious marquee in the french encampment
was shoved aside and a man issued from beneath the drapery into the
open air he was enveloped in a cloak that might have been intended as
a protection from the chilling damps of the woods but which served
equally well as a mantle to conceal his person he was permitted to pass
the grenadier who watched over the slumbers of the french commander
without interruption the man making the usual salute which betokens
military deference as the other passed swiftly through the little
city of tents in the direction of william henry whenever this unknown
individual encountered one of the numberless sentinels who crossed his
path his answer was prompt and as it appeared satisfactory for he
was uniformly allowed to proceed without further interrogation

with the exception of such repeated but brief interruptions he
had moved silently from the center of the camp to its most advanced
outposts when he drew nigh the soldier who held his watch nearest to
the works of the enemy as he approached he was received with the usual
challenge

qui vive

france was the reply

le mot d'ordre

la victorie said the other drawing so nigh as to be heard in a loud
whisper

c'est bien returned the sentinel throwing his musket from the charge
to his shoulder vous promenez bien matin monsieur

il est necessaire d'etre vigilant mon enfant the other observed
dropping a fold of his cloak and looking the soldier close in the
face as he passed him still continuing his way toward the british
fortification the man started his arms rattled heavily as he threw
them forward in the lowest and most respectful salute and when he had
again recovered his piece he turned to walk his post muttering between
his teeth

il faut etre vigilant en verite je crois que nous avons la un
caporal qui ne dort jamais

the officer proceeded without affecting to hear the words which escaped
the sentinel in his surprise nor did he again pause until he had
reached the low strand and in a somewhat dangerous vicinity to the
western water bastion of the fort the light of an obscure moon was just
sufficient to render objects though dim perceptible in their outlines
he therefore took the precaution to place himself against the trunk of
a tree where he leaned for many minutes and seemed to contemplate the
dark and silent mounds of the english works in profound attention his
gaze at the ramparts was not that of a curious or idle spectator
but his looks wandered from point to point denoting his knowledge of
military usages and betraying that his search was not unaccompanied
by distrust at length he appeared satisfied and having cast his eyes
impatiently upward toward the summit of the eastern mountain as if
anticipating the approach of the morning he was in the act of turning
on his footsteps when a light sound on the nearest angle of the bastion
caught his ear and induced him to remain

just then a figure was seen to approach the edge of the rampart where
it stood apparently contemplating in its turn the distant tents of the
french encampment its head was then turned toward the east as though
equally anxious for the appearance of light when the form leaned
against the mound and seemed to gaze upon the glassy expanse of the
waters which like a submarine firmament glittered with its thousand
mimic stars the melancholy air the hour together with the vast frame
of the man who thus leaned musing against the english ramparts
left no doubt as to his person in the mind of the observant spectator
delicacy no less than prudence now urged him to retire and he had
moved cautiously round the body of the tree for that purpose when
another sound drew his attention and once more arrested his footsteps
it was a low and almost inaudible movement of the water and was
succeeded by a grating of pebbles one against the other in a moment
he saw a dark form rise as it were out of the lake and steal without
further noise to the land within a few feet of the place where he
himself stood a rifle next slowly rose between his eyes and the watery
mirror but before it could be discharged his own hand was on the lock

hugh exclaimed the savage whose treacherous aim was so singularly
and so unexpectedly interrupted

without making any reply the french officer laid his hand on the
shoulder of the indian and led him in profound silence to a distance
from the spot where their subsequent dialogue might have proved
dangerous and where it seemed that one of them at least sought a
victim then throwing open his cloak so as to expose his uniform and
the cross of st louis which was suspended at his breast montcalm
sternly demanded

what means this does not my son know that the hatchet is buried
between the english and his canadian father

what can the hurons do returned the savage speaking also though
imperfectly in the french language

not a warrior has a scalp and the pale faces make friends

ha le renard subtil methinks this is an excess of zeal for a friend
who was so late an enemy how many suns have set since le renard struck
the war-post of the english

where is that sun demanded the sullen savage behind the hill and
it is dark and cold but when he comes again it will be bright and
warm le subtil is the sun of his tribe there have been clouds and
many mountains between him and his nation but now he shines and it is a
clear sky

that le renard has power with his people i well know said montcalm
for yesterday he hunted for their scalps and to-day they hear him at
the council-fire

magua is a great chief

let him prove it by teaching his nation how to conduct themselves
toward our new friends

why did the chief of the canadas bring his young men into the woods
and fire his cannon at the earthen house demanded the subtle indian

to subdue it my master owns the land and your father was ordered to
drive off these english squatters they have consented to go and now he
calls them enemies no longer

tis well magua took the hatchet to color it with blood it is now
bright when it is red it shall be buried

but magua is pledged not to sully the lilies of france the enemies of
the great king across the salt lake are his enemies his friends the
friends of the hurons

friends repeated the indian in scorn let his father give magua a
hand

montcalm who felt that his influence over the warlike tribes he had
gathered was to be maintained by concession rather than by power
complied reluctantly with the other's request the savage placed the
fingers of the french commander on a deep scar in his bosom and then
exultingly demanded

does my father know that

what warrior does not tis where a leaden bullet has cut

and this continued the indian who had turned his naked back to the
other his body being without its usual calico mantle

this my son has been sadly injured here who has done this

magua slept hard in the english wigwams and the sticks have left their
mark returned the savage with a hollow laugh which did not conceal
the fierce temper that nearly choked him then recollecting himself
with sudden and native dignity he added go teach your young men it
is peace le renard subtil knows how to speak to a huron warrior

without deigning to bestow further words or to wait for any answer
the savage cast his rifle into the hollow of his arm and moved silently
through the encampment toward the woods where his own tribe was known to
lie every few yards as he proceeded he was challenged by the sentinels
but he stalked sullenly onward utterly disregarding the summons of the
soldiers who only spared his life because they knew the air and tread
no less than the obstinate daring of an indian

montcalm lingered long and melancholy on the strand where he had
been left by his companion brooding deeply on the temper which his
ungovernable ally had just discovered already had his fair fame been
tarnished by one horrid scene and in circumstances fearfully resembling
those under which he now found himself as he mused he became keenly
sensible of the deep responsibility they assume who disregard the means
to attain the end and of all the danger of setting in motion an engine
which it exceeds human power to control then shaking off a train of
reflections that he accounted a weakness in such a moment of triumph
he retraced his steps toward his tent giving the order as he passed to
make the signal that should arouse the army from its slumbers

the first tap of the french drums was echoed from the bosom of the fort
and presently the valley was filled with the strains of martial music
rising long thrilling and lively above the rattling accompaniment the
horns of the victors sounded merry and cheerful flourishes until the
last laggard of the camp was at his post but the instant the british
fifes had blown their shrill signal they became mute in the meantime
the day had dawned and when the line of the french army was ready to
receive its general the rays of a brilliant sun were glancing along the
glittering array then that success which was already so well known
was officially announced the favored band who were selected to guard
the gates of the fort were detailed and defiled before their chief the
signal of their approach was given and all the usual preparations for
a change of masters were ordered and executed directly under the guns of
the contested works

a very different scene presented itself within the lines of the
anglo-american army as soon as the warning signal was given it
exhibited all the signs of a hurried and forced departure the sullen
soldiers shouldered their empty tubes and fell into their places
like men whose blood had been heated by the past contest and who only
desired the opportunity to revenge an indignity which was still wounding
to their pride concealed as it was under the observances of military
etiquette

women and children ran from place to place some bearing the scanty
remnants of their baggage and others searching in the ranks for those
countenances they looked up to for protection

munro appeared among his silent troops firm but dejected it was evident
that the unexpected blow had struck deep into his heart though he
struggled to sustain his misfortune with the port of a man

duncan was touched at the quiet and impressive exhibition of his grief
he had discharged his own duty and he now pressed to the side of the
old man to know in what particular he might serve him

my daughters was the brief but expressive reply

good heavens are not arrangements already made for their convenience

to-day i am only a soldier major heyward said the veteran all that
you see here claim alike to be my children

duncan had heard enough without losing one of those moments which had
now become so precious he flew toward the quarters of munro in quest
of the sisters he found them on the threshold of the low edifice
already prepared to depart and surrounded by a clamorous and weeping
assemblage of their own sex that had gathered about the place with a
sort of instinctive consciousness that it was the point most likely to
be protected though the cheeks of cora were pale and her countenance
anxious she had lost none of her firmness but the eyes of alice were
inflamed and betrayed how long and bitterly she had wept they both
however received the young man with undisguised pleasure the former
for a novelty being the first to speak

the fort is lost she said with a melancholy smile though our good
name i trust remains

tis brighter than ever but dearest miss munro it is time to think
less of others and to make some provision for yourself military
usage pride that pride on which you so much value yourself demands
that your father and i should for a little while continue with the
troops then where to seek a proper protector for you against the
confusion and chances of such a scene

none is necessary returned cora who will dare to injure or insult
the daughter of such a father at a time like this

i would not leave you alone continued the youth looking about him
in a hurried manner for the command of the best regiment in the pay of
the king remember our alice is not gifted with all your firmness and
god only knows the terror she might endure

you may be right cora replied smiling again but far more sadly than
before listen chance has already sent us a friend when he is most
needed

duncan did listen and on the instant comprehended her meaning the low
and serious sounds of the sacred music so well known to the eastern
provinces caught his ear and instantly drew him to an apartment in
an adjacent building which had already been deserted by its customary
tenants there he found david pouring out his pious feelings through
the only medium in which he ever indulged duncan waited until by the
cessation of the movement of the hand he believed the strain was ended
when by touching his shoulder he drew the attention of the other to
himself and in a few words explained his wishes

even so replied the single-minded disciple of the king of israel
when the young man had ended i have found much that is comely and
melodious in the maidens and it is fitting that we who have consorted
in so much peril should abide together in peace i will attend them
when i have completed my morning praise to which nothing is now wanting
but the doxology wilt thou bear a part friend the meter is common
and the tune southwell

then extending the little volume and giving the pitch of the air anew
with considerate attention david recommenced and finished his strains
with a fixedness of manner that it was not easy to interrupt heyward
was fain to wait until the verse was ended when seeing david relieving
himself from the spectacles and replacing the book he continued

it will be your duty to see that none dare to approach the ladies with
any rude intention or to offer insult or taunt at the misfortune of
their brave father in this task you will be seconded by the domestics
of their household

even so

it is possible that the indians and stragglers of the enemy may
intrude in which case you will remind them of the terms of the
capitulation and threaten to report their conduct to montcalm a word
will suffice

if not i have that here which shall returned david exhibiting
his book with an air in which meekness and confidence were singularly
blended here are words which uttered or rather thundered with proper
emphasis and in measured time shall quiet the most unruly temper

why rage the heathen furiously

enough said heyward interrupting the burst of his musical
invocation we understand each other it is time that we should now
assume our respective duties

gamut cheerfully assented and together they sought the females cora
received her new and somewhat extraordinary protector courteously at
least and even the pallid features of alice lighted again with some of
their native archness as she thanked heyward for his care duncan
took occasion to assure them he had done the best that circumstances
permitted and as he believed quite enough for the security of
their feelings of danger there was none he then spoke gladly of his
intention to rejoin them the moment he had led the advance a few miles
toward the hudson and immediately took his leave

by this time the signal for departure had been given and the head of
the english column was in motion the sisters started at the sound and
glancing their eyes around they saw the white uniforms of the french
grenadiers who had already taken possession of the gates of the fort
at that moment an enormous cloud seemed to pass suddenly above their
heads and looking upward they discovered that they stood beneath the
wide folds of the standard of france

let us go said cora this is no longer a fit place for the children
of an english officer

alice clung to the arm of her sister and together they left the parade
accompanied by the moving throng that surrounded them

as they passed the gates the french officers who had learned their
rank bowed often and low forbearing however to intrude those
attentions which they saw with peculiar tact might not be agreeable
as every vehicle and each beast of burden was occupied by the sick and
wounded cora had decided to endure the fatigues of a foot march rather
than interfere with their comforts indeed many a maimed and feeble
soldier was compelled to drag his exhausted limbs in the rear of the
columns for the want of the necessary means of conveyance in that
wilderness the whole however was in motion the weak and wounded
groaning and in suffering their comrades silent and sullen and the
women and children in terror they knew not of what

as the confused and timid throng left the protecting mounds of the fort
and issued on the open plain the whole scene was at once presented to
their eyes at a little distance on the right and somewhat in the
rear the french army stood to their arms montcalm having collected his
parties so soon as his guards had possession of the works they were
attentive but silent observers of the proceedings of the vanquished
failing in none of the stipulated military honors and offering no taunt
or insult in their success to their less fortunate foes living masses
of the english to the amount in the whole of near three thousand
were moving slowly across the plain toward the common center and
gradually approached each other as they converged to the point of their
march a vista cut through the lofty trees where the road to the hudson
entered the forest along the sweeping borders of the woods hung a dark
cloud of savages eyeing the passage of their enemies and hovering at
a distance like vultures who were only kept from swooping on their prey
by the presence and restraint of a superior army a few had straggled
among the conquered columns where they stalked in sullen discontent
attentive though as yet passive observers of the moving multitude

the advance with heyward at its head had already reached the defile
and was slowly disappearing when the attention of cora was drawn to
a collection of stragglers by the sounds of contention a truant
provincial was paying the forfeit of his disobedience by being
plundered of those very effects which had caused him to desert his place
in the ranks the man was of powerful frame and too avaricious to
part with his goods without a struggle individuals from either party
interfered the one side to prevent and the other to aid in the robbery
voices grew loud and angry and a hundred savages appeared as it were
by magic where a dozen only had been seen a minute before it was
then that cora saw the form of magua gliding among his countrymen and
speaking with his fatal and artful eloquence the mass of women and
children stopped and hovered together like alarmed and fluttering
birds but the cupidity of the indian was soon gratified and the
different bodies again moved slowly onward

the savages now fell back and seemed content to let their enemies
advance without further molestation but as the female crowd approached
them the gaudy colors of a shawl attracted the eyes of a wild and
untutored huron he advanced to seize it without the least hesitation
the woman more in terror than through love of the ornament wrapped her
child in the coveted article and folded both more closely to her bosom
cora was in the act of speaking with an intent to advise the woman to
abandon the trifle when the savage relinquished his hold of the shawl
and tore the screaming infant from her arms abandoning everything
to the greedy grasp of those around her the mother darted with
distraction in her mien to reclaim her child the indian smiled grimly
and extended one hand in sign of a willingness to exchange while with
the other he flourished the babe over his head holding it by the feet
as if to enhance the value of the ransom

here here there all any everything exclaimed the breathless
woman tearing the lighter articles of dress from her person with
ill-directed and trembling fingers take all but give me my babe

the savage spurned the worthless rags and perceiving that the shawl
had already become a prize to another his bantering but sullen smile
changing to a gleam of ferocity he dashed the head of the infant
against a rock and cast its quivering remains to her very feet for an
instant the mother stood like a statue of despair looking wildly down
at the unseemly object which had so lately nestled in her bosom and
smiled in her face and then she raised her eyes and countenance toward
heaven as if calling on god to curse the perpetrator of the foul
deed she was spared the sin of such a prayer for maddened at his
disappointment and excited at the sight of blood the huron mercifully
drove his tomahawk into her own brain the mother sank under the blow
and fell grasping at her child in death with the same engrossing love
that had caused her to cherish it when living

at that dangerous moment magua placed his hands to his mouth and
raised the fatal and appalling whoop the scattered indians started at
the well-known cry as coursers bound at the signal to quit the goal
and directly there arose such a yell along the plain and through the
arches of the wood as seldom burst from human lips before they who
heard it listened with a curdling horror at the heart little inferior
to that dread which may be expected to attend the blasts of the final
summons

more than two thousand raving savages broke from the forest at the
signal and threw themselves across the fatal plain with instinctive
alacrity we shall not dwell on the revolting horrors that succeeded
death was everywhere and in his most terrific and disgusting aspects
resistance only served to inflame the murderers who inflicted their
furious blows long after their victims were beyond the power of their
resentment the flow of blood might be likened to the outbreaking of
a torrent and as the natives became heated and maddened by the sight
many among them even kneeled to the earth and drank freely exultingly
hellishly of the crimson tide

the trained bodies of the troops threw themselves quickly into solid
masses endeavoring to awe their assailants by the imposing appearance
of a military front the experiment in some measure succeeded though
far too many suffered their unloaded muskets to be torn from their
hands in the vain hope of appeasing the savages

in such a scene none had leisure to note the fleeting moments it might
have been ten minutes it seemed an age that the sisters had stood
riveted to one spot horror-stricken and nearly helpless when the first
blow was struck their screaming companions had pressed upon them in
a body rendering flight impossible and now that fear or death had
scattered most if not all from around them they saw no avenue open
but such as conducted to the tomahawks of their foes on every side
arose shrieks groans exhortations and curses at this moment alice
caught a glimpse of the vast form of her father moving rapidly across
the plain in the direction of the french army he was in truth
proceeding to montcalm fearless of every danger to claim the tardy
escort for which he had before conditioned fifty glittering axes
and barbed spears were offered unheeded at his life but the savages
respected his rank and calmness even in their fury the dangerous
weapons were brushed aside by the still nervous arm of the veteran or
fell of themselves after menacing an act that it would seem no one had
courage to perform fortunately the vindictive magua was searching for
his victim in the very band the veteran had just quitted

father father we are here shrieked alice as he passed at no great
distance without appearing to heed them come to us father or we
die

the cry was repeated and in terms and tones that might have melted
a heart of stone but it was unanswered once indeed the old man
appeared to catch the sound for he paused and listened but alice had
dropped senseless on the earth and cora had sunk at her side hovering
in untiring tenderness over her lifeless form munro shook his head in
disappointment and proceeded bent on the high duty of his station

lady said gamut who helpless and useless as he was had not yet
dreamed of deserting his trust it is the jubilee of the devils and
this is not a meet place for christians to tarry in let us up and fly

go said cora still gazing at her unconscious sister save thyself
to me thou canst not be of further use

david comprehended the unyielding character of her resolution by the
simple but expressive gesture that accompanied her words he gazed for a
moment at the dusky forms that were acting their hellish rites on every
side of him and his tall person grew more erect while his chest heaved
and every feature swelled and seemed to speak with the power of the
feelings by which he was governed

if the jewish boy might tame the great spirit of saul by the sound of
his harp and the words of sacred song it may not be amiss he said
to try the potency of music here

then raising his voice to its highest tone he poured out a strain so
powerful as to be heard even amid the din of that bloody field more
than one savage rushed toward them thinking to rifle the unprotected
sisters of their attire and bear away their scalps but when they found
this strange and unmoved figure riveted to his post they paused to
listen astonishment soon changed to admiration and they passed on to
other and less courageous victims openly expressing their satisfaction
at the firmness with which the white warrior sang his death song
encouraged and deluded by his success david exerted all his powers to
extend what he believed so holy an influence the unwonted sounds caught
the ears of a distant savage who flew raging from group to group like
one who scorning to touch the vulgar herd hunted for some victim more
worthy of his renown it was magua who uttered a yell of pleasure when
he beheld his ancient prisoners again at his mercy

come he said laying his soiled hands on the dress of cora the
wigwam of the huron is still open is it not better than this place

away cried cora veiling her eyes from his revolting aspect

the indian laughed tauntingly as he held up his reeking hand and
answered it is red but it comes from white veins

monster there is blood oceans of blood upon thy soul thy spirit has
moved this scene

magua is a great chief returned the exulting savage will the
dark-hair go to his tribe

never strike if thou wilt and complete thy revenge he hesitated a
moment and then catching the light and senseless form of alice in his
arms the subtle indian moved swiftly across the plain toward the woods

hold shrieked cora following wildly on his footsteps release the
child wretch what is't you do

but magua was deaf to her voice or rather he knew his power and was
determined to maintain it

stay lady stay called gamut after the unconscious cora the
holy charm is beginning to be felt and soon shalt thou see this horrid
tumult stilled

perceiving that in his turn he was unheeded the faithful david
followed the distracted sister raising his voice again in sacred song
and sweeping the air to the measure with his long arm in diligent
accompaniment in this manner they traversed the plain through the
flying the wounded and the dead the fierce huron was at any time
sufficient for himself and the victim that he bore though cora would
have fallen more than once under the blows of her savage enemies
but for the extraordinary being who stalked in her rear and who now
appeared to the astonished natives gifted with the protecting spirit of
madness

magua who knew how to avoid the more pressing dangers and also to
elude pursuit entered the woods through a low ravine where he quickly
found the narragansetts which the travelers had abandoned so shortly
before awaiting his appearance in custody of a savage as fierce and
malign in his expression as himself laying alice on one of the horses
he made a sign to cora to mount the other

notwithstanding the horror excited by the presence of her captor there
was a present relief in escaping from the bloody scene enacting on the
plain to which cora could not be altogether insensible she took her
seat and held forth her arms for her sister with an air of entreaty
and love that even the huron could not deny placing alice then on the
same animal with cora he seized the bridle and commenced his route
by plunging deeper into the forest david perceiving that he was left
alone utterly disregarded as a subject too worthless even to destroy
threw his long limb across the saddle of the beast they had deserted
and made such progress in the pursuit as the difficulties of the path
permitted

they soon began to ascend but as the motion had a tendency to revive
the dormant faculties of her sister the attention of cora was too much
divided between the tenderest solicitude in her behalf and in listening
to the cries which were still too audible on the plain to note the
direction in which they journeyed when however they gained the
flattened surface of the mountain-top and approached the eastern
precipice she recognized the spot to which she had once before been led
under the more friendly auspices of the scout here magua suffered them
to dismount and notwithstanding their own captivity the curiosity
which seems inseparable from horror induced them to gaze at the
sickening sight below

the cruel work was still unchecked on every side the captured were
flying before their relentless persecutors while the armed columns
of the christian king stood fast in an apathy which has never been
explained and which has left an immovable blot on the otherwise fair
escutcheon of their leader nor was the sword of death stayed until
cupidity got the mastery of revenge then indeed the shrieks of the
wounded and the yells of their murderers grew less frequent until
finally the cries of horror were lost to their ear or were drowned in
the loud long and piercing whoops of the triumphant savages

 why anything
 an honorable murderer if you will
 for naught i did in hate but all in honor
 othello

the bloody and inhuman scene rather incidentally mentioned than
described in the preceding chapter is conspicuous in the pages of
colonial history by the merited title of the massacre of william
henry it so far deepened the stain which a previous and very similar
event had left upon the reputation of the french commander that it was
not entirely erased by his early and glorious death it is now becoming
obscured by time and thousands who know that montcalm died like a hero
on the plains of abraham have yet to learn how much he was deficient in
that moral courage without which no man can be truly great pages might
yet be written to prove from this illustrious example the defects of
human excellence to show how easy it is for generous sentiments high
courtesy and chivalrous courage to lose their influence beneath the
chilling blight of selfishness and to exhibit to the world a man who
was great in all the minor attributes of character but who was found
wanting when it became necessary to prove how much principle is superior
to policy but the task would exceed our prerogatives and as history
like love is so apt to surround her heroes with an atmosphere of
imaginary brightness it is probable that louis de saint veran will be
viewed by posterity only as the gallant defender of his country while
his cruel apathy on the shores of the oswego and of the horican will be
forgotten deeply regretting this weakness on the part of a sister muse
we shall at once retire from her sacred precincts within the proper
limits of our own humble vocation

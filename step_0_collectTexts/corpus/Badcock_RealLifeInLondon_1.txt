triumphant returning at night with the spoil
like bacchanals shouting and gay
how sweet with a bottle and song to refresh
and lose the fatigues the day
with sport wit and wine fickle fortune defy
dull wisdom all happiness sours
since life is no more than a passage at best
let's strew the way over with flowers
they order these things better in london replied the hon tom
dashall to an old weatherbeaten sportsman who would fain have made a
convert our london sprig fashion to the sports and delights 
rural life the party were regaling themselves after the dangers and
fatigues a very hard day's foxchace and while the sparkling glass
circulated each anxious to impress on the minds the company the
value the exploits and amusements in which he felt most delight
became more animated and boisterous in his oratory forgetting that
excellent regulation which forms an article in some the rules and
orders our free and easier in london that no more than three
gentlemen shall be allowed to speak at the same time the whole party
consisting fourteen like a pack in full cry had with the kind
assistance the rosy god become at the same moment most animated
not to say vociferous orators the young squire bob tally ho as he
was called belville hall who had recently come into possession 
this fine and extensive domain was far from feeling indifferent to the
pleasures a sporting life and in the chace had even acquired the
reputation being a keen sportsman but the regular intercourse
which took place between him and his cousin the hon tom dashall 
bond street notoriety had in some measure led to an indecision
 character and often when perusing the lively and fascinating
descriptions which the latter drew the passing scenes in the
gay metropolis bob would break out into an involuntary exclamation
 curse me but after all this only is real life while for the
moment horses dogs and gun with the whole paraphernalia 
sporting were annihilated indeed to do justice to his elegant
and highlyfinished friend these pictures were the production a
masterhand and might have made a dangerous impression on minds
more stoical and determined than that bob's the opera theatres
fashionable pursuits characters objects c all became in succession
the subjects his pen and if lively description blended with
irresistible humour and sarcastic wit possessed any power seduction
these certainly belonged to bob's honourable friend and relative as an
epistolary correspondent the following stanzas were often recited by
him with great feeling and animation
parent pleasure and many a groan
i should be loath to part with thee i own
dear life
to tell the truth i'd rather lose a wife 
should heav'n e'er deem me worthy possessing
that best that most invaluable blessing
i thank thee that thou brightest me into being
the things this our world are well worth seeing
and let me add moreover well worth feeling
then what the devil would people have
these gloomy hunters the grave
for ever sighing groaning canting kneeling
some wish they never had been born how odd
to see the handy works god
in sun and moon and starry sky
though last not least to see sweet woman's charms
nay more to clasp them in our arms
and pour the soul in love's delicious sigh
is well worth coming for i'm sure
supposing that thou gav'st us nothing more
yet thus surrounded life dear life i'm thine
and could i always call thee mine
i would not quickly bid this world farewell
but whether here or long or short my stay
i'll keep in mind for ev'ry day
an old french motto vive la bagatelle 
misfortunes are this lotteryworld's sad blanks
presents in my opinion not worth thanks
the pleasures are the twenty thousand prizes
which nothing but a downright ass despises
it was not however the mere representations bob's friend with
which in consequence the important result we commenced our
chapter that produced the powerful effect fixing the wavering mind
 bob no it was the air the manner the je ne sais quoi by which
these representations were accompanied the curled lip contempt and
the eye measuring as he spoke from top to toe his companions with
the cool elegant sang froid and selfpossession displayed in his own
person and manner which became a fiat with bob and which effected
the object so long courted by his cousin
after the manner yorick though by the bye no sentimentalist bob
thus reasoned with himself if an acquaintance with london is to give
a man these airs superiority this ascendancy elegance manners
and command enjoyments why london for me and if pleasure is the
game in view there will i instantly pursue the sport
the song and toast in unison with the sparkling glass followed each
other in rapid succession during which our elegant london visitor
favoured the company with the following effusion sung in a style equal
to though unaccompanied with the affected airs and selfimportance 
a firstrate professor
song
if to form and distinction in town you would bow
let appearance wealth be your care
if your friends see you live not a creature cares how
the question will only be where
a circus a polygon crescent or place
with ideas magnificence tally
squares are common streets queer but a lane's a disgrace
and we've no such thing as an alley
a first floor's pretty well and a parlour so so
but pray who can give themselves airs
or mix with high folks if so vulgarly low
to live up in a two pair stairs
the garret excuse me i mean attic floor
that's the name and it's right you should know it
would he tenantless often but genius will soar
and it does very well for a poet
these amusements the table were succeeded by a most stormy and
lengthened debate to use a parliamentary phrase during which bob's
london friend had with daring heroism opposed the whole the party
in supporting the superiority life in london over every pleasure
the country could afford after copious libations to bacchus whose
influence at length effected what oratory had in vain essayed and
silenced these contending and jarring elements greyeyed morn peeped
intrusively amid the jovial crew and somnus with the cart before the
horse stepping softly on tiptoe after his companion led if not by
at least accompanied with the music the nose each to his snoring
pillow
glorious resolve exclaimed tom as soon as his friend had next
morning intimated his intention nobly resolved indeed what shall
he whom nature has formed to shine in the dance and sparkle in the
ring to fascinate the fair lead and control the fashions attract the
gaze and admiration the surrounding crowd shall he pass a life or
rather a torpid existence amid country bumpkins and johnnyraws forbid
it all ye powers that rule with despotic sway where life alone is to
be found forbid it cards dice balls fashion and ye gay et
covers forbid pon my soul interrupted bob you have
frightened me to death i thought you were beginning an epic a thing
i abominate all others i had rather at any time follow the pack on
a foundered horse than read ten lines homer so my dear fellow
descend for god's sake from the heroics
calmly let me at least begin life's chapter
not panting for a hurricane rapture
calm let me step not riotous and jumping
with due decorum let my heart
try to perform a sober part
not at the ribs be ever bumping bumping
rapture's a charger often breaks his girt
runs oft and flings his rider in the dirt
however it shall be so adieu my dear little roan
filly snowball good by my new patent doublebarrelled
percussion ah i give you all up order the tandem my dear tom
whenever you please whisk me up to the fairy scenes you have so often
and admirably described and above all things take me as an humble and
docile pupil under your august auspices and tuition says tom 
the day unheeded and forgotten
the next advance our hero was an important step the mailcoach is
considered the school its driver the great master the art the
phidias the statuary the claude the landscapepainter to
approach him without preparatory instruction and study would be like
an attempt to copy the former without a knowledge anatomy or the
latter while ignorant perspective the standard excellence the
model perfection all that the highest ambition can attain is to
approach as near as possible the original to attempt a deviation would
be to bolt out the course snap the curb and run riot sensible
 the importance his character accustomed to hold the reins 
arbitrary power and seated where will is law the mailwhip carries
in his appearance all that may be expected from his elevated situation
stern and sedate in his manner and given to taciturnity he speaks
sententiously or in monosyllables if he passes on the road even an
humble follower the profession with four tidy ones in hand he
views him with ineffable contempt and would consider it an irreparable
disgrace to appear conscious the proximity should it be a country
gentleman large property and influence and he held the reins
and handled the whip with a knowledge the art so to get over the
ground coachy might perhaps notice him en passant by a slight
and familiar nod but it is only the peer or man firstrate sporting
celebrity that is honoured with any thing like a familiar mark 
approbation and acquaintance and these justly appreciating the proud
distinction feel higher gratification by it than any thing the monarch
could bestow it is an inclination the head not forward in the
manner a nod but towards the off shoulder accompanied with a
certain jerk and elevation from the opposite side but here neither pen
nor pencil can depict it belongs to him alone whose individual powers
can nightly keep the house in a roar to catch the living manner and
present it to the eye
a merrier man
within the limit becoming mirth

his eye begets occasion for his wit
for every object that the one doth catch

and now gentle reader if the epithet means any thing you cannot but
feel disposed to good humour and indulgence instead rattling you
off as was proposed at our last interview and whirling you at the
rate twelve miles an hour exhausted with fatigue and half dead
in pursuit life we have proceeded gently along the road amusing
ourselves by the way rather with drawing than driving tis high time
however we made some little progress in our journey come bob
take the reins push on keep moving touch up the leader into a
handgallop give snarler his head that's it my tight one keep out 
the ruts mind your quartering not a gig buggy tandem or tilbury
have we yet seen on the road what an infernal place for a human
being to inhabit curse me if i had not as lief emigrate to the back
settlements america one might find some novelty and amusement
there i'd have the woods cleared cut out some turnpikeroads and
like palmer start the first mail stop tom don't set off yet
to the illinois here's something ahead but what the devil it is i
cant guess why it's a barge on wheels and drove fourinhand ha
ha barge indeed bob you seem to know as much about coaches as snarler
does backgammon i suppose you never see any thing in this quarter
but the old heavy bridgewater why we have half a dozen new launches
every week and as great a variety names shape size and colour
as there are ships in the navy we have the heavy coach light coach
caterpillar and mail the balloon comet fly dart regulator
telegraph courier times highflyer hope with as many others as
would fill a list as long as my tandemwhip what you now see is one 
the new patent safetycoaches you can't have an overturn if you're
ever so disposed for a spree the old city cormorants after a gorge 
mockturtle turn into them for a journey and drop off in a nap
with as much confidence security to their neck and limbs as if they
had mounted a rockinghorse or dropt into an armchair ah come
the scene improves and becomes a little like life here's a dasher
making up to the safety why its no impossible can't be gad it
is tho the dart by all that's good and drove by hellfire
dick there's a fellow would do honour to any box drove the cambridge
fly three months pass'd every thing on the road and because he
overturned in three or four hard matches the stupid rascals 
proprietors moved him off the ground joe spini who's at corpus
christ matched dick once for when he carried five inside
and thirteen at top besides heavy luggage against the other
cambridge never was a prettier race seen at newmarket dick must
have beat hollow but a d d fat alderman who was inside and felt
alarmed at the velocity the vehicle moved to the other the
seat this destroyed the equilibrium over they went into a fourfeet
ditch and joe lost his match however he had the satisfaction 
hearing afterwards that the old cormorant who occasioned his loss had
nearly burst himself by the concussion
see see dick's got up to and wants to give the safety the go
by gad its a race go it dick now safety d d good cattle
both lay it in to em dick leaders neck and neck pretty race
by g ah its no use safety dick wont stand it a dead
beat there she goes all up over by jove i can't see for that
tree what do you say tom is the race over race ah and the coach
too knew dick would beat him would have betted the long odds the
moment i saw it was him
the tandem had by this time reached the racecourse and the disaster
which tom had hardly thought worth noticing in his lively description 
the sport sure enough had befallen the new patent safety which was
about mid way between an upright and a side position supported by the
high and very strong quicksethedge against which it hath fallen our
heroes dismounted left flip at the leader's head and with ned the
other groom proceeded to offer their services whilst engaged in
extricating the horses which had become entangled in their harness and
were kicking and plunging their attention was arrested by the screams
and outrageous vociferations a very fat middleaged woman who
had been jerked from her seat on the box to one not quite so
smooth the top the hedge which with the assistance an old alder
tree supported the coach tom found it impossible to resist the violent
impulse to risibility which the ludicrous appearance the old lady
excited and as no serious injury was sustained determined to enjoy the
fun
if e'er a pleasant mischief sprang to view
at once o'er hedge and ditch away he flew
nor left the game till he had run it down
approaching her with all the gravity countenance he was master
 madam says he are we to consider you as one the sylvan
deities who preside over these scenes or connected in any way with the
vehicle vehicle indeed you inhumanbrutes instead assisting
a poor distressed female who has been chucked from top that there
safetything as they calls it into such a dangerous position you
must be chuckling and grinning must you i only wish my husband mr
giblet was here he should soon wring your necks and pluck some 
your fine feathers for you and make you look as foolish as a peacock
without his tail mrs giblet's ire at length having subsided she was
handed down in safety on terra firma and our heroes transferred their
assistance to the other passengers the violence the concussion had
burst open the coachdoor on one side and a london dandy the
exquisite genus lay in danger being pressed to a jelly beneath the
weight an infirm and very stout old farmer whom they had pick'd upon
the road and it was impossible to get at so as to afford relief to
the sufferers till the coach was raised in a perpendicular position
the farmer was no sooner on his legs than clapping his hand with
anxious concern into an immense large pocket he discovered that a
bottle brandy it contained was crack'd and the contents beginning to
escape i ax pardon young gentleman says he seizing a hat that the
latter held with great care in his hand and applying it to catch the
liquor i ax pardon for making so free but i see the hat is a little
out order and can't be much hurt and its a pity to waste the
liquor such a price as it is nowadays sir what do you mean
shouldn't have thought your taking such liberties indeed but makes
good the old saying impudence and ignorance go together my hat
out order hey i'd have you to know sir that that there hat
was bought lloyd in newgatestreet only last thursdaysand cost
eighteen shillings and if you look at the in his window on
hats dedicated to the head you'll find that this here hat is a real
exquisite so much for what you know about hats my old fellow i burst
my stays all to pieces in saving it from being squeezed out shape
and now this old brute has made a brandybottle it oh oh my
young miss in disguise replied the farmer i thought i smelt a
rat when the captain left the coach under pretence walking up the
hill what i suppose you are bound for gretna both you lev young
lady
every thing appertaining to the coach being now righted our young
friends left the company to adjust their quarrels and pursue their
journey at discretion anxious to reach the next town as expeditiously
as possible where they purposed sleeping for the night they mounted
the tandem smack went the whip and in a few minutes the stagecoach
and its motley group had disappeared
having reached their destination and passed the night comfortably they
next morning determined to kill an hour or two in the town and were
taking a stroll arm in arm when perceiving by a playbill that an
amateur fashion from the theatres royal drury lane and haymarket
was just come in and would shortly come out 
 it would be injustice to great talents not to notice
among other important discoveries and improvements the
age the labours lloyd who has classified and arranged
whatever relates to that necessary article personal
elegance the hat he has given the world a volume on the
subject hats dedicated to their great patron the head
in which all the endless varieties shape dependent
before on mere whim and caprice are reduced to fixed
principles and designated after the great characters by
which each particular fashion was first introduced the
advantages to gentlemen residing in the country must be
incalculable they have only to refer to the engravings in
mr lloyd's work where every possible variety is clearly
defined and to order such as may suit the rank or character
in life they either possess or wish to assume the
following enumeration comprises a few the latest fashions
the wellington the regent the caroline the
bashful the dandy the shallow the exquisite the marquis
the new dash the clericus the tallyho the noble lord
the tantum the bangup the irresistible the bon ton the
paris beau the baronet the eccentric the bit blood
c
in a favourite character they immediately directed their steps
towards a barn with the hope witnessing a rehearsal chance
introduced them to the country manager and tom having asked several
questions about this candidate was assured by mr mist
oh he is a gentlemanperformer and very useful to us managers for he
not only finds his own dresses and properties but struts and frets
his hour on the stage without any emoluments his aversion to salary
recommended him to the lessee drurylane theatre though his services
had been previously rejected by the subcommittee
can it be that gamecock the gay lothario said tom who sports an
immensity diamonds
 coates's frolics he course well knew rare pastime for the
ragamuffin crew who welcome with the crowing a cock this hero 
the buskin and sock
oh no rejoined mr mist that cock don't crow now this gentleman
i assure you has been at a theatrical school he was instructed by the
person who made master betty a young roscius
tom shook his head as if he doubted the abilities this instructed
actor to be a performer he thought as arduous as to be a poet and
if poeta nascitur non fit consequently an actor must have natural
abilities
and pray what character did this gentleman enact at drurylane
theatre
hamlet prince denmark answered mr mist shakespeare is his
favourite author
and what said the critics to be or not to be i suppose he repeated
the character
oh sir it was stated in the playbill that he met with great
applause and he was announced for the character again but as the free
list was not suspended and our amateur dreaded some hostility from that
quarter he performed the character by proxy and repeated it at the
little theatre in the haymarket
then the gentlemen the free list remarked bob are free and
easy
yes yes they laugh and cough whenever they please indeed they are
generally excluded whenever a full house is expected as ready
money is an object to the poor manager drurylane theatre the
british press however is always excepted
the british press oh you mean the newspapers exclaimed tom then
i dare say they were very favourable to this amateur fashion
no not very indeed they don't join the manager in his puffs
notwithstanding his marked civility to them one said he was a methodist
preacher and sermonized the character another assimilated him to a
schoolboy saying his lesson in short they were very illnatured but
hush here he is walk in gentlemen and you shall hear him rehearse
some king richard
king richard what ambition thought bob to himself late a prince
and now a king
i assure you continued mr mist that all his readings are new but
according to my humble observation his action does not always suit the
word for when he exclaims may hell make crooked my mind he looks
up to heaven
looks up to heaven exclaimed tom then this london star makes a
solecism with his eyes
our heroes now went into the barn and took a private corner when they
remained invisible their patience was soon exhausted and bob and his
honourable cousin were both on the fidgets when the representative 
king richard exclaimed
give me a horse 
whip added tom with stunning vociferation before king richard
could bind up his wounds the amateur started and betrayed consummate
embarrassment as if the horsewhip had actually made its entrance tom
and his companion stole away and left the astounded monarch with the
words twas all a dream
while returning to the inn our heroes mutually commented on the
ambition and folly those amateurs fashion who not only sacrifice
time and property but absolutely take abundant pains to render
themselves ridiculous certainly says tom this cacoethes ludendi
has made fools several this infatuated youth though not possessed
 a single requisite for the stage no doubt flatters himself he is
a second kean and regardless his birth and family he will
continue his strolling life
till the broad shame comes staring in his face
and critics hoot the blockhead as he struts
having now reached the inn and finding every thing adjusted for their
procedure our heroes mounted their vehicle and went in full gallop for
real life in london
chapter iii
round round and roundabout they whiz they fly
with eager worrying whirling here and there
they know nor whence nor whither where nor why
in utter hurryscurry going coming
maddening the summer air with ceaseless humming
our travellers now approached at a rapid rate the desideratum
 their eager hopes and wishes to one all was novel wonderful and
fascinating to the other it was the welcome return to an old and
beloved friend the separation from whom had but increased the ardour
 attachment we now says dashall are approaching hydepark
and being sunday a scene will at once burst upon you far surpassing
in reality any thing i have been able to pourtray notwithstanding
them and though by some he
is termed a visionary an enthusiast and a tool party his adherence
to the rights the subject and his perseverance to uphold the
principles the constitution are deserving the admiration every
englishman and although his fortune is princely and has been at his
command ever since an early age he has never had his name registered
among the fashionable gamesters at the clubs in st james'sstreet
newmarket or elsewhere he labours in the vineyard utility rather
than in the more luxuriant garden folly and according to general
conception may emphatically be called an honest man but come said
tom it is time for us to move homeward the company are drawing off i
see we must shape our course towards piccadilly
they dashed through the park not however without being saluted by many
 his fashionable friends who rejoiced to see that the honourable
tom dashall was again to be numbered among the votaries real life in
london while the young squire whose visionary orbs appeared to be
in perpetual motion dazzled with the splendid equipages the moving
panorama was absorbed in reflections somewhat similar to the following
no spot on earth to me is half so fair
as hydepark corner or st james's square
and happiness has surely fix'd her seat
in palace yard pall mall or downing street
are hills and dales and valleys half so gay
as bright st james's on a levee day
what fierce ecstatic transports fire my soul
to hear the drivers swear the coaches roll
the courtier's compliment the ladies clack
the satins rustle and the whalebone crack
chapter 
together let us beat this ample field
try what the open what the covert yield
the latent tracts the giddy heights explore
 all who blindly creep or sightless soar
eye nature's walks shoot folly as it flies
and catch the manners living as they rise
it was half past five when the hon tom dashall and his enraptured
cousin reached the habitation the former who had taken care to
dispatch a groom apprizing mrs watson the housekeeper his
intention to be at home by half past six to dinner consequently all
was prepared for their reception the style elegance in which tom
appeared to move struck tallyhoho at once with delight and astonishment
as they entered the drawingroom which was superbly and tastefully
fitted up and commanded a cheerful view piccadilly welcome my
dear bob said tom to his cousin to all the delights town come
tell me what you think its first appearance only remember you
commence your studies life in london on a dull day tomorrow you
will have more enlivening prospects before you why in truth
replied bob the rapidity attraction is such as at present to leave
no distinct impressions on my mind all appears like enchantment and
i am completely bewildered in a labyrinth wonders to which there
appears to be no but under your kind guidance and tuition i may
prove myself an apt scholar in unravelling its intricacies by this
time they had approached the window
aye aye says dashall we shall not be long i see without some
object to exercise your mind upon and dispel the horrors
oh for that muse fire whose burning pen
records the godlike deeds valiant men
then might our humble yet aspiring verse
our matchless hero's matchless deeds rehearse
bob was surprised at this sudden exclamation his cousin and
from the introduction naturally expected something extraordinary though
he looked around him without discovering his object
that continued tom is a peer pointing to a gig just turning the
corner whom it may be said
to many a jovial club that peer was known
with whom his active wit unrivall'd shone
choice spirit grave freemason buck and blood
would crowd his stories and bon mots to hear
and none a disappointment e'er need fear
his humour flow'd in such a copious flood
it is lord c who was formerly well known as the celebrated major
h the companion the now most distinguished personage in the
british dominions and who not long since became possessed his
lordly honours some particulars him are worth knowing he was
early introduced into life and often kept both good and bad company
associating with men and women every description and every rank
from the highest to the lowest from st james's to st giles's in
palaces and nightcellars from the drawingroom to the dustcart he
can drink swear tell stories cudgel box and smoke with any one
having by his intercourse with society fitted himself for all companies
his education has been more practical than theoretical though he was
brought up at eton where notwithstanding he made considerable progress
in his studies he took such an aversion to greek that he never would
learn it previous to his arrival at his present title he used to be
called honest george and so unalterable is his nature that to this
hour he likes it and it fits him better than his title but he has
often been sadly put to his shifts under various circumstances he was
a courtier but was too honest for that he tried gaming but he was too
honest for that he got into prison and might have wiped off but he
was too honest for that he got into the coal trade but he found it a
black business and he was too honest for that at drawing the longbow
so much perhaps cannot be said but that you know is habit not
principle his courage is undoubted having fought three duels before he
was twenty years age
being disappointed in his hope promotion in the army he resolved in
spite the remonstrances his friends to quit the guards
and solicited an appointment in one the hessian corps at that
time raising for the british service in america where the war the
revolution was then commencing and obtained from the landgrave hesse
a captain's commission in his corps wagers
previous to his departure for america finding he had involved himself
in difficulties by a profuse expenditure too extensive for his income
and an indulgence in the pleasures the turf to a very great extent
he felt himself under the necessity mortgaging an estate about
l per annum left him by his aunt and which proved unequal to
the liquidation his debts he remained in america till the the
war where he distinguished himself for bravery and suffered much with
the yellow fever on his return he obtained an introduction to the
prince wales who by that time had launched into public life and
became one the jovial characters whom he selected for his associates
and many are the amusing anecdotes related him the prince conferred
on him the appointment equerry with a salary l a year this
however he lost on the retrenchments that were afterwards made in the
household his royal highness he continued however to be one 
his constant companions and while in his favour they were accustomed
to practice strange vagaries the major was always a wag ripe and ready
for a spree or a lark 
to him a frolic was a high delight
a frolic he would hunt for day and night
careless how prudence on the sport might frown
at one time when the favourite's finances were rather low and the
mosses ran taper it was remarked among the vivants the
party that the major had not for some time given them an invitation
this however he promised to do and fixed the day the prince
having engaged to make one upon this occasion he took lodgings in
tottenhamcourt road went to a winemerchant promised to introduce
him to the royal presence upon his engaging to find wine for the party
which was readily acceded to and a dinner three courses was served
up three such courses perhaps were never before seen when the
company were seated two large dishes appeared one was placed at the
top the table and one at the bottom all was anxious expectation
the covers being removed exhibited to view a baked shoulder 
mutton at top and baked potatoes at the bottom they all looked around
with astonishment but knowing the general eccentricity their host
they readily fell into his humour and partook his fare not doubting
but the second course would make ample amends for the first the wine
was good and the major apologized for his accommodations being as he
said a family sort man and the dinner though somewhat uncommon
was not such an one as is described by goldsmith
at the top a fried liver and bacon were seen
at the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen
at the sides there were spinach and pudding made hot
in the middle a place where the pasty was not
at length the second course appeared when lo and behold another baked
shoulder mutton and baked potatoes surprise followed surprise but
another and another still succeeds
the third course consisted the same fare clearly proving that he
had in his catering studied quantity more than variety however they
enjoyed the joke eat as much as they pleased laughed heartily at the
dinner and after simpering till a late hour took their departure it
is said however that he introduced the winemerchant to his highness
who afterwards profited by his orders
 this remarkable dinner reminds us a laughable
caricature which made its appearance some time ago upon the
marriage a jew attorney in jewrystreet lydgate to the
daughter a wellknown fishmonger st peter'salley
cornhill when a certain baronet alderman colonel and
then lord mayor opened the ball at the london tavern as
the partner the bride a circumstance which excited
considerable curiosity and surprise at the time we know the
worthy baronet had been a hunter for a seat in parliament
but what he could be hunting among the children israelis
perhaps not so easily ascertained we however are not
speaking the character but the caricature which
represented the bride not resting on abraham's bosom but
seated on his knee surrounded by their guests at the
marriagefeast while to a panel just behind them appears
to be affixed a bill fare which runs thus
first course fish
second course fish
third course fish
perhaps the idea the artist originated in the anecdote
above recorded
it is reported that the prince gave him a commission under an
express promise that when he could not shew it he was no longer to
enjoy his royal favour this commission was afterwards lost by the
improvident possessor and going to call on the donor one morning who
espying him on his way he threw up the sash and called out well
george commission or no commission no commission by g your
highness was the reply
then you cannot enter here rejoined the prince closing the window
and the connection at the same time
his lordship now resides in the regent's park and may almost nightly
be seen at a publichouse in the neighbourhood where he takes his grog
and smokes his pipe amusing the company around him with anecdotes 
his former days we may perhaps fall in with him some night in
our travels and you will find him a very amusing and sometimes very
sensible sort fellow till he gets his grog on board when he can be
as boisterous and blustering as a coalheaver or a bully his present
fortune is impaired by his former imprudence but he still mingles with
the sporting world and a short time back had his pocket picked at a
milling match a valuable gold repeater he has favoured the world
with several literary productions among which are memoirs his own
life embellished with a view the author suspended from to use the
phrase a late celebrated auctioneer a hanging wood and a very
elaborate treatise on the art ratcatching in the advertisement 
the latter work the author engages it will enable the reader to clear
any house these noxious vermin however much infested excepting
only a certain great house in the neighbourhood st stephen's
westminster
 it appears by the newspapers that the foundation a
certain great house in pall mall is rotten and givingway
the cause is not stated but as it cannot arise from being
topheavy we may presume that the rats have been at work
there query would not an early application the major's
recipe have remedied the evil and prevented the necessity
 a removal a very heavy body which course must be
attended with a very heavy expense tis a pity an old
friend should have been overlooked on such an occasion
do you said tom pointing to a person on the other side 
the way see that young man walking with a halfsmothered air 
indifference affecting to whistle as he walks and twirling his
stick he is a onceaweek man or in other words a sunday
promenade harry hairbrain was born a good family and at the
decease his father became possessed ten thousand pounds which
he sported with more zeal than discretion so much so that having been
introduced to the gaming table by a pretended friend and fluctuated
between poverty and affluence for four years he found himself
considerably in debt and was compelled to seek refuge in an obscure
lodging somewhere in the neighbourhood tilbury in order to avoid
the traps for as he observes he has been among the greeks and
pigeons who have completely looked him and now want to crow
over him he has been at hide and seek for the last two months and
depending on the death a rich old maiden aunt who has no other heir
he eventually hopes to diddle em 
this narrative hairbrain was like hebrew ta tallyhoho who requested
his interesting cousin as he found himself at salt to try back and
put him on the right scent 
ha ha ha said tom we must find a new london vocabulary i see
before we shall be able to converse intelligibly but as you are now
solely under my tuition i will endeavour to throw a little light upon
the subject
your onceaweek man or sunday promenade is one who confines
himself to avoid confinement lodging in remote quarters in the
vicinity the metropolis within a mile or two the bridges
oxford street or hydepark corner and is constrained to waste six
uncomfortable and useless days in the week in order to secure the
enjoyment the seventh when he fearlessly ventures forth to recruit
his ideas to give a little variety to the sombre picture life
unmolested to transact his business or to call on some old friend
and keep up those relations with the world which would otherwise be
completely neglected or broken
among characters this description may frequently be recognised the
remnant fashion and perhaps the impression nobility not wholly
destroyed by adversity and seclusion the air and manners a man
who has outlived his century with an assumption sans souci
pourtrayed in his agreeable smile murmur'd through a low whistle 
begone dull care or no more by sorrow chased my heart or played
off by the flourishing a whip or the rapping a boot that hasa
spur attached to it which perhaps has not crossed a horse for
many months and occasionally by a judicious glance at another man's
carriage horses or appointments which indicates taste and the former
possession such valuable things these form a part the votaries
 real life in london this however said he observing his cousin in
mute attention is but a gloomy part the scene vet perhaps not
altogether uninteresting or unprofitable
i can assure you replied tallyhoho i am delighted with the accurate
knowledge you appear to have society in general while i regret the
situation the actors in scenes so glowingly described and am only
astonished at the appearance such persons
you must not be astonished at appearances rejoined dashall for
appearance is every thing in london and i must particularly warn you
not to found your judgment upon it there is an old adage which says
to be poor and seem poor is the devil all over why if you meet
one these sundaymen he will accost you with urbanity and affected
cheerfulness endeavouring to inspire you with an idea that he is one 
the happiest mortals while perhaps the worm sorrow is secretly
gnawing his heart and preying upon his constitution honourable
sentiment struggling with untoward circumstances is destroying
his vitals not having the courage to pollute his character by a
jaildelivery or to condescend to whitewashing or some low bankrupt
trick to extricate himself from difficulty in order to stand upright
again
a onceaweek man or sunday promenade frequently takes his way
through bye streets and short cuts through courts and alleys as it
were between retirement and a desire to see what is going on in the
scenes his former splendour to take a sly peep at that world from
which he seems to be excluded
and for all such men replied bob expelled from high and from good
society even though i were compelled to allow by their own imprudence
and folly i should always like to have a spare hundred to send
them in an anonymous cover
you are right rejoined tom catching him ardently by the hand
the sentiment does honour to your head and heart for to such men in
general is attached a heartbroken wife withering by their side in the
shade as the leaves and the blossom cling together at all seasons in
sickness or in health in affluence or in poverty until the storm beats
too roughly on them and prematurely destroys the weakest but i must
warn you not to let your liberality get the better your discretion
for there are active and artful spirits abroad and even these
necessities and miseries are made a handle for deception to entrap the
unwary and you yet have much to learn puff lived two years on sickness
and misfortune by advertisements in the newspapers
how enquired bob
you shall have it in his own words said dashall
i suppose never man went through such a series 
calamities in the same space time sir i was five
times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state 
affluence by a train unavoidable misfortunes then
sir though a very industrious tradesman i was twice
burnt out and lost my little all both times i lived
upon those fires a month i soon after was confined by a
most excruciating disorder and lost the use my limbs
that told very well for i had the case strongly attested
and went about col called on you a close prisoner
in the marshalsea for a debt benevolently contracted
to serve a friend i was afterwards twice tapped
for a dropsy which declined into a very profitable
consumption i was then reduced to no then
i became a widow with six helpless children after
having had eleven husbands pressed and being left
every time eight months gone with child and without
money to get me into an hospital
astonishing cried bob and are such things possible
a month's residence in the metropolis said dashall will satisfy
your enquiries one ingenious villain a short time back had artifice
enough to defraud the public at different periods his life 
upwards one hundred thousand pounds and actually carried on
his fraudulent schemes to the last moment his existence for he
defrauded jack ketch his fee by hanging himself in his cell
after condemnation
just as a tilbury was passing observe said tom the driver that
tilbury is the celebrated lord cripplegate with his usual equipage his
blue cloak with a scarlet lining hanging loosely over the vehicle
gives an air importance to his appearance and he is always attended
by that boy who has been denominated his cupid he is a nobleman
by birth a gentleman by courtesy and a gamester by profession he
exhausted a large estate upon odd and even sevens the main c till
having lost sight the main chance he found it necessary to curtail
his establishment and enliven his prospects by exchanging a first floor
for a second without an opportunity ascertaining whether or not
these alterations were best suited to his high notions or exalted taste
from which in a short time he was induced either by inclination or
necessity to take a small lodging in an obscure street and to sport
a gig and one horse instead a curricle and pair though in former
times he used to drive four in hand and was acknowledged to be an
excellent whip he still however possessed money enough to collect
together a large quantity halfpence which in his hours relaxation
he managed to turn to good account by the following stratagem he
distributed his halfpence on the floor his little parlour in straight
lines and ascertained how many it would require to cover it having
thus prepared himself he invited some wealthy spendthrifts with whom
he still had the power associating to sup with him and he welcomed
them to his habitation with much cordiality the glass circulated
freely and each recounted his gaming or amorous adventures till a late
hour when the effects the bottle becoming visible he proposed as a
momentary suggestion to name how many halfpence laid side by side would
carpet the floor and offered to lay a large
 charles price the wellknown impostor whose extensive
forgeries on the bank england rendered him notorious may
serve as a practical illustration puff for he at
several periods his life carried on his system fraud
by advertisements and by personating the character a
clergyman collecting subscriptions under various pretences
his whole life is marked with determined and systematic
depravity he hanged himself in tothilfields bridewell
where he was confined at the age fiftyfive
wager that he would guess the nearest done done was echoed
round the room every one made a deposit l and every one made a
guess equally certain success and his lordship declaring he had
a large lot halfpence by him though perhaps not enough the
experiment was to be tried immediately twas an excellent hit the room
was cleared to it they went the halfpence were arranged rank and file
in military order when it appeared that his lordship had certainly
guessed as well he might nearest to the number the consequence was
an immediate alteration his lordship's residence and appearance he
got one step in the world by it he gave up his secondhand gig for
one warranted new and a change in his vehicle may pretty generally be
considered as the barometer his pocket
do you mark he is hearing at that pretty girl on the other side the
way he is fond the wenches and has been a true votary fashion
perhaps there is not a more perfect model real life in london than
might be furnished from the memoirs his lordship he is rather a good
looking man as he sits and prides himself on being a striking likeness
 his present majesty but unfortunately has a lameness which
impedes him in the ardour his pursuit game although it must be
acknowledged he has been a game one in his time the boy you see with
him is reported to be his own son who is now employed by him as an
assistant in all his amorous adventures
his own son exclaimed bob
aye and if so a merrily begotten one i'll be bound for it
continued tom such things will happen and his lordship has kept a
very pretty assortment servant girls but the introduction this
youth to public notice was somewhat curious it is said that having a
large party bon vivants to dine with him on sitting down to table
and taking the cover off one the dishes a plump and smiling infant
appeared a sweet little cupid by
exclaimed his lordship i'll be his father i'll
take care him call rose and tell her to look out for a nurse for
him thus taking upon himself the character parent and protector as
well as parson young cupid was christened in libations claret and
furnished a fund amusement for the evening how young cupid came
there i believe has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained
who seeks a friend should come disposed
t exhibit in full bloom disclosed
the graces and the beauties
that form the character he seeks
for tis an union that bespeaks
reciprocated duties
and thus it has proved with cupid himself the offspring an illicit
amour is now constantly engaged in promoting others
his lordship had three brothers billingsgate delegate and
newgate whose names are adorned with a similarity perfections in
the temple fame but they are consigned to the tomb the capulet
and we will not rake up the ashes the dead
at this moment a loud knocking was heard at the door and mr sparkle
was ushered into the drawingroom which he entered as it were with a
hop step and jump and had tom dashall by the hand almost before they
could turn round to see who it was
my dear fellow exclaimed sparkle almost out breath where have
you been to time has been standing still since your departure there
has been a complete void in nature how do you do i beg pardon
turning to bob you will excuse my rapture at meeting my old friend
whom i have lost so long that i have almost lost myself egad i have
run myself out breath cursed unlucky i was not in the park this
morning to see you first but i have just heard all about you from lady
jane and lost no time in paying my respects what are you going to do
with yourself
 there was a delicate propriety in this conduct the hon
tom dashall which cannot but be admired for although they
were alone and speaking to each other in perfect
confidence it was always his desire to avoid as much as
possible making bad worse he had a heart to feel as well
as a head to think and would rather lend a hand to raise a
fellowcreature from the mud than walk deliberately over
him besides he foresaw other opportunities would arise in
which from circumstances he would almost be compelled to
draw his cousin's attention again to the persons in
question and he was always unwilling to exhast a subject
 an interesting nature without sonic leading occurrence to
warrant it
at this moment dinner was announced come said tom let us
refresh a bit and after dinner i will tell you all about it we are
travellers you know and feel a little fatigued allons allons and
so saying he led the way to the dinnerroom
nothing could be more apropos said sparkle for although i have
two engagements beforehand and have promised a visit to you know who in
the evening they appear like icicles that must melt before the sun 
your reappearance so i am your's and to it they went tom always
kept a liberal table and gave his friends a hearty welcome but here
it will be necessary while they are regaling themselves to make
our readers a little acquainted with charles sparkle esq for which
purpose we must request his patience till the next chapter
chapter v
place me thou great supreme in that blest state
unknown to those the silly world call great
where all my wants may be with ease supply'd
yet nought superfluous to pamper pride
it will be seen in the previous chapter that the formal ceremony
 a fashionable introduction such as mr sparkle my friend mr
robert tallyhohohoho belville hall mr tallyhohohoho mr charles sparkle was
altogether omitted indeed the abrupt entrance the latter rendered
it utterly impossible for although sparkle was really a wellbred man
he had heard from lady jane tom's arrival with his young friend from
the country etiquette between themselves was at all times completely
unnecessary an air gaiety and freedom as the friend dashall was
introduction enough to bob and consequently this point good breeding
was wholly unnoticed by all the party but we are not yet sufficiently
acquainted with our readers to expect a similar mode proceeding will
be overlooked we shall therefore lose no time in giving our promised
account mr sparkle and beg to introduce him accordingly
mr reader mr sparkle mr sparkle mr reader
hold sir what are you about you have bewildered yourself with
etiquette and seem to know as little about life in london as the
novice you have already introduced by the way that introduction was
one the most extraordinary i ever met with this may be equally so
for ought i know and i really begin to suspect you are an extraordinary
fellow yourself how can you introduce me whom you know nothing
egad i believe you have me there a palpable hit my lord or my
lady for i certainly cannot say which i was getting myself into an
awkward dilemma but i hate suspicion
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind
methinks i see a frown but i meant no offence and if you throw
down my in a rage you will perhaps not only remain ignorant 
mr sparkle but what is more important those other
numerous fashionable characters in high and low life those
manners incidents amusements follies vices c which combined
together form the true picture real life in the metropolis
he who hath trod th intricate maze
exploring every devious way
can best direct th enquiring gaze
and all the varied scenes display
mr author you are a strange rambler
admitted sir or ma'am i am a rambler who with your permission
would willingly not be impeded in my progress and under such
expectations i shall proceed
charles sparkle was the son and only child a right hon member 
parliament now no more whose mother dying soon after his birth was
left destitute that maternal kindness and solicitude which frequently
has so much influence in forming the character the future man
his father a man eccentric turn mind being appointed soon
afterwards to a diplomatic situation abroad left the care his son's
education to an elderly friend his who held a situation some
importance under the then existing government with an injunction to
conceal from the boy the knowledge his real parent and to bring him
up as his own child
this important trust was executed with tenderness and fidelity the boy
grew in strength and ripened in intelligence and being accustomed
to consider his protector as his parent the father upon returning
to england determined not to undeceive him until he should arrive at
years discretion and with this view mr oxford was instructed at a
proper age to send him to oxford
charles however had contracted before this period habits and
acquaintances in london that were completely in opposition to the
dictates and inclinations his supposed father he became passionately
fond literary amusements music and drawing which served to occupy
his morning hours but his evenings were devoted to the company 
vitiated associates who did not fail to exercise their influence
over his youthful passions and he frequently engaged himself in unlucky
and improvident adventures which involved him in pecuniary difficulties
far beyond his stipulated income these circumstances were no sooner
made known to the supposed parent than they excited his displeasure
and being carried to an unpardonable extent he was at the age 
eighteen literally banished the house his protector and compelled
to take an obscure lodging in the vicinity london the rent which
was paid for him and a scanty allowance one guinea sent to him
regularly every saturday night thus secluded from his old associates
it will not be wondered at that he contrived to form new ones and
having purchased an old harpsichord turned the musical instruction
he had received to occasional account he also wrote some political
pamphlets which were well received but this solitary and dependent life
was wholly unsuited to the gaiety in which he had hitherto moved it
had however the effect drawing forth talent which perhaps would
never but for this circumstance have been discovered for
many a gem purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness on the desert air
his writings c under the name oribrd were recognised by the real
father as the productions a promising son at his instigation and
upon a promise reform he was again restored to his former home and
shortly after entered as a gentleman commoner st mary's oxford but
not till he had by some means or other made the discovery that
oxford was not his real name congenial spirits are naturally fond 
associating and it was here that he first became acquainted with the
hon tom dashall they were constant companions and mutual assistants to
each other in all their exercises as well as all their vagaries so
as to cement a friendship and interest in each other's fate up to the
moment which we are now speaking
oxford however was at that time more impetuous and less discreet
in the pursuit his pleasures than his honourable friend and after
obtaining the distinction bachelor arts was in consequence 
his imprudence and irregularities after frequently hairbreadth
escapes expelled the college this circumstance however appeared 
little consequence to him he hired a gig at oxford promising to return
in a few days and came up to london but had not effrontery enough to
venture into the presence his reputed father on arrival in town he
put up at an inn in the borough where he resided till all the money
he had was exhausted and till as he emphatically observes he had
actually eaten his horse and chaise
in the mean time the people at oxford found he was expelled and ashe
had not returned according to appointment he was pursued and
eventually found they had no doubt obtaining their demand from
his friends and he was arrested at the suit the lender which was
immediately followed by a retainer from the innkeeper where he had
resided in town application was made to mr oxford for his liberation
without effect in consequence which he became a resident in the
rules the king's bench as his friends conceived by this means his
habits would be corrected and his future conduct be amended his real
father still keeping in the back ground
while in this confinement he again resorted to the produce his pen
and his talent for musical composition and his friend tom at the first
vacation did not fail to visit him during this time in the shape
 donation from mr oxford he received occasional supplies more than
equal to his necessities though not to his wishes while here he
fished out some further clue to the real parent who visited him in
disguise during his confinement as a friend mr oxford still
however he had no chance liberation till being one day called on
by mr oxford he was informed he was at perfect liberty to leave his
present abode and was directed to go with him immediately a coach was
called and he heard the direction given to drive to bedford square
where they arrived just time enough to learn that the right hon s s
had breathed his last after a lingering illness
upon alighting from the coach and receiving this information they were
ushered into the drawingroom and presently joined by a clergyman who
had been the chaplain the deceased who acquainted our adventurer 
the death his parent that by will he was entitled to l
per annum and a handsome estate in wiltshire this sudden reverse
 fortune to sparkle the change from confinement to liberty from
indigence to affluence awakened sensations more easily to be conceived
than described he wept perhaps the first tears sincerity in his
life his heart was subdued by an overwhelming flood affection for
that unknown being whom he now found had been his constant guardian
angel alternately taking oxford and the reverend divine by the hand
and hiding his head in the bosom his reputed father at length they
led him to the room in which were the remains his lamented parent
there are perhaps few circumstances better calculated to impress awe
on the youthful mind than the contemplation those features in death
which have been respected and revered while living such respect had
ever been entertained by charles sparkle for the supposed friend 
mr oxford from whom he had several times received the most kind and
affectionate advice and his sensations upon discovering that friend
to be no other than his own father may be more easily conceived than
described he was at once exalted and humbled delighted and afflicted
he threw himself in an agony feeling by the bedside fell on his
knees in which he was joined by the clergyman and oxford where he
remained some time
after the first paroxysms grief had subsided young sparkle who had
already felt the strongest impression that could possibly be made on
a naturally good heart gave orders for the funeral his deceased
father and then proceeded to make other arrangements suitable to
the character he was hereafter to sustain through life went down
to wiltshire and took possession his estate where for a time he
secluded himself and devoted his attention to the perusal the
best authors in the english french and italian language under the
superintendence the reverend divine who had been a resident for many
years with his father
but a life in the country could not long have superior charms for a
young man who had already seen much to admire as well as much to avoid
in the metropolis the combination however theoretical information
he had derived from books as well as the practical observations he had
made during his residence in london fitted him at once for the
gayest and most distinguished circles metropolitan society
he therefore arranged with mr oxford who had formerly acted as his
parent to continue with him in the capacity steward and for the
last two years his life had been almost a constant resident at
long's hotel in bond street not choosing to have the charge an
establishment in town and the early friendship and attachment which
had been cultivated at oxford being again renewed appeared to grow with
their growth and strengthen with their strength
sparkle had still a large portion that vivacity for which he was so
remarkable in his younger days his motives and intentions were at all
times good and if he indulged himself in the pursuits frolic and
fun it was never at the expence creating an unpleasant feeling to an
honest or honourable mind his fortune was ample he had a hand to give
and a heart to forgive no malice or hatred were there to be found
but these qualifications and the exercise them sufficient traits
will be given in the ensuing pages no man was better up to the rigs
 the town no one better down to the manoeuvres the flats and
sharps he had mingled with life in all companies he was at once an
elegant and interesting companion his views were extensive upon all
subjects his conversation lively and his manners polished
such gentle reader is the brief sketch charles sparkle the
esteemed friend the hon tom dashall and with such recommendations
it will not be wondered at if he should become also the friend nd sure to do her good
so much for living in style and good breeding
that's your true breeding that's your sort my boys
fun fire and pathos metre mirth and noise
to make you die with laughter or the hiccups
tickle your favourites or smash your teacups
by the way in former times the term goodbreeding meant a
combination all that was amiable and excellent and a wellbred
person would shrink from an action or expression that could possibly
wound the feelings another its foundation was laid in truth and
its supporting pillars were justice and integrity sensibility and
philanthropy but
in this gay age in taste's enlighten'd times
when fashion sanctifies the basest crimes
e'en not to swear and game were impolite
since he who sins in style must sure be right
a wellbred person must learn to smile when he is angry and to laugh
even when he is vexed to the very soul
it would be the height mauvaise honte for a welled person to
blush upon any occasions whatever no young lady blushes after eleven
years age to study the expression the countenance others in
order to govern your own is indispensably necessary
in former times no wellbred person would have uttered a falsehood
but now such ideas are completely exploded and such conduct would now
be termed a bore my lord portly remarks it is a cold day yes my
lord it is a very cold day replies major punt in two minutes after
meeting lord lounge who observes he thinks the weather very warm yes
very warm my lord is the reply thus contradicting himself almost in
the same breath it would be perfectly inconsistent in a wellbred
man to think for fear being absent when he enters or leaves a
drawingroom he should round his shoulders drop his head and
imitate a clown or a coachman this has the effect the best ruse
de guerre for it serves to astonish the ladies when they afterwards
discover by the familiarity his address and his unrestrained
manners what a wellbred man he is for he will address every fair one
in the room in the most enchanting terms except her to whom in the same
party he had previously paid the most particular attention and on her
he will contrive to turn his back for the whole evening and if he is a
man fashion he will thus cause triumph to the other ladies and save
the neglected fair one from envious and slanderous whisperings
an admirable picture living in style and good breeding indeed
cried tom the game is in view and well worth pursuit so hark forward
hark forward my boys
sparkle now recollecting his engagement with you know who as he
significantly observed in the last chapter withdrew after promising to
take a stroll by way killing an hour or two with them in the morning
and tom and his cousin soon after retired to rest
perchance to sleep perchance to dream
chapter 
the alarm was so strong
so loud and so long
twas surely some robber or sprite
who without any doubt
was prowling about
to fill ev'ry heart with affright
the smiles a may morning bedecked with the splendid rays a
rising sun awakened tallyhoho about five o'clock and being accustomed to
rise early in the country he left the downy couch soft repose and
sought his way down stairs not a sound any kind was to be heard in
the house but the rattling the carts and the coaches in the streets
with the deeptoned accompaniment a fustian's bell and an occasional
ab libitum clothes clothes sale gave bob an idea that all the
world was moving however he could find nobody up he walked into the
drawingroom amused himself for some time by looking out the window
indulging his observations and remarks without knowing what to make 
the moving mass incongruities which met his eye and wondering what
time the servants the house would wake he tried the streetdoor but
found it locked bolted and chained and if he had known where to have
found his friend tom he would have aroused him with the view halloo 
it is strange thought he to himself all the world seems abroad
and yet not a soul stirring here then checking the current his
reflections but this said he is life in london egad i must not
make a noise because it will not be good breeding in this way he
sauntered about the house for near two hours till at last espying his
portmanteau which had been left in the passage by the servants the
previous evening i'll carry this up stairs said he by way 
amusement and carelessly shouldering the portmanteau he was walking
deliberately up stairs when his ears were suddenly attracted by a
loud cry murder murder thieves murder and the violent ringing
 a bell alarmed at these extraordinary sounds which appeared to be
near him at a moment when he conceived no soul was stirring he dropped
his portmanteau over the banisters which fell demolishing in its way
an elegant grecian patent lamp with glass shades drops c into the
passage below with a hideous crash while the cry murder thieves
murder was repeated by many voices and rendered him almost immoveable
in the next moment the butler the cook the groom and indeed every
person in the house appeared on the staircase some almost in a state
 nudity and shrinking from each other's gaze and all armed with
such weapons as chance had thrown in their way to attack the supposed
depredator
among the rest fortunately for tallyhoho who stood balancing himself
against the banisters in a state indecision whether he should ascend
or descend tom dashall in his nightgown burst out his room in alarm
at the noise with a brace pistols one in his hand in the very act
 cocking it and the other placed in convenient readiness under his
left arm why what the devil is the matter vociferated he and at
that moment his eye caught the agitated figure his cousin bob on the
halflanding place below him at the sound his wellknown voice the
innocent and unsuspecting cause this confusion and alarm looked up
at his friend as if half afraid and half ashamed the occurrence and
stammered out where is the thief who is murdered i'll swear there
is something broke somewhere tell me which way to go tom looked
around him at the group halfclad nymphs and swains who were now
huddling together conceiving their security lay in combination and
finding all eyes were placed with astonishment and wonder on bob began
to see through what had happened and burst into an immoderate fit 
laughter which relieved the frightened damsels but so confounded poor
tallyhoho that he scarcely knew whether he was standing on his head or
his heels why said tom addressing himself to his cousin you will
get yourself murdered if you go wandering about people's houses at the
dead the night in this manner are you asleep or awake who have you
made an assignation with or where are you going to what are you
up to master bobby eh these tricks won't do here
isn't love's unhallow'd flame invites to roam
and bids you from your pillow creep
or say why thus disturb my peaceful home
like macbeth who doth murder sleep
tallyhoho was unable to reply he looked down over the banister he looked
up at the risible features tom dashall who was almost bursting at
the ludicrous situation in which he found his friend and his servants
come said tom there are no thieves all's right to the
servants you may quiet your minds and go to business bob i'll be
down with you presently upon this the staircase was cleared in an
instant all but the unfortunate tallyhoho and peace appeared to
be restored in the family but not to bob's mind conceiving he had
committed a gross violation good breeding and shewn but a bad
specimen his aptitude to become a learner london manners it must
be confessed it was rather an awkward commencement however in a few
minutes recovering himself from the fright he crawled gently down the
stairs and took a survey the devastation he had made cursed the
lamp d d the portmanteau then snatching it from the ruin before
him and again placing his luggage on his shoulder he quietly walked upstairs
to his bedroom
it is much to be lamented in this wonderful age discovery and
continual improvement that our philosophers have not yet found out a
mode supplying the place glass as almost every thing else with
castiron the substitution gas for oil has long been talked as
one national importance even so much so that one man whose ideas
were as brilliant as his own experiments has endeavoured to shew that
its produce would in a short time pay off the national debt
a consummation devoutly to be wished and experience has taught the
world at large there is nothing impossible nor is there any one inexistence
more credulous than honest john bull but we are
 mr windsor the original lecturer on the powers gas in
pall mall
digressing from the adventure the lamp however it was
occasioned by clearly proving it was not a patent safetylamp and
that among the luxuries the hon tom dashall's habitation gas had
not yet been introduced will speedily be discovered
upon arriving in his bedroom wondering within himself how he should
repair the blundering mistake which he had so unluckily been the
unwilling and unconscious author he found himself in a new dilemma
as the receptacle the oil had fallen with the lamp and plentifully
bedewed the portmanteau with its contents so that he had now
transferred the savoury fluid to his coat waistcoat cravat and shirt
what was to be done in such a case he could not make his appearance in
that state but his mortifications were not yet at an 
hills over hills and alps on alps arise
the key his portmanteau was missing he rummaged all his pockets
in vain he turned them inside out it was not here it was not
there enraged at the multiplicity disappointments to which he was
subjected he cut open the leathern carriage his wardrobe with
a penknife undressed and redressed himself by which time it was
halfpast eight o'clock his cousin tom who had hurried down according
to promise had in the mean time been making enquiry after him and now
entered the room singing
and all with attention would eagerly mark
when he cheer'd up the pack hark to lockwood hark hark
at the sight dashall he recovered himself from his embarrassment
and descended with him to the breakfastparlour
did you send to robinson's enquired tom one the servants as
they entered the room yes sir was the reply and weston's too
continued he being answered in the affirmative then let us have
breakfast directly then turning to bob sparkle said he promised
to be with us about eleven for the purpose taking a stroll in the
mean time we must dress and make ready dress said bob egad
i have dressed and made ready twice already this morning he then
recounted the adventures above recorded at which dashall
repeatedly burst into fits immoderate laughter breakfast being over
a person from mr robinson's was announced and ushered into the room
a more prepossessing appearance had scarcely met bob's eye a tall
elegant young man dressed in black cut in the extreme fashion
whose features bespoke intelligence and whose air and manner were
indicative a something which to him was quite new he arose upon his
entrance and made a formal bow which was returned by the youth good
morning gentlemen good morning mr r said tom mentioning
a name celebrated by
pope in the following lines
but all my praises why should lords engross
bise honest muse and sing the man boss
i am happy to have the honour seeing you in town again sir
the fashionables are mustering very strong and the prospect the
approaching coronation appears to be very attractive during this
time he was occupied in opening a leathern case which contained combs
brushes c then taking off his coat he appeared in a jacket with an
apron which like a fashionable pinafore the present day nearly

the coronation is a subject deep importance just now in the

which genius is entitled to and talents will invariably

addressing the audience it had inscribed at the bottom

in allusion no doubt to the tragedy barbarossa
it was an extraordinary situation for all parties said bob but
hold who have we here egad there is an elegant carriage drawn up to
the door some lord or nobleman i'll be bound for it we can't be seen
in this deshabille i shall make my escape and saying this he was
hastening out the room
ha ha ha exclaimed tom you need not be so speedy in your flight
this is one the fashionable requisites london with whom you
must also become acquainted there is no such thing as doing without
them dress and address are indispensables this is no other than one 
the decorators
decorators continued bob not exactly comprehending him
monsieur le tailleur tin mr w from cork street come to
exhibit his spring patterns and turn us out with the new cut so pray
remain where you are
tailor decorator said bob egad the idea is almost as ridiculous
as the representation the taylor riding to brentford
by this time the door was opened and mr w entered making his bow
with the precision a dancingmaster and was followed by a servant
with patternbooks the other apparatus his trade the first
salutations over large patternbooks were displayed upon the table
exhibiting to view a variety fancycoloured cloths and measures
taken accordingly during which time tom as on the former occasion
continued his enquiries relative to the occurrences in the fashionable
world
rather tame sir at present the queen's unexpected visit to the two
theatres was for a time a matter surprise the backwardness drury
lane managers to produce god save the king has been construed into
disloyalty to the sovereign and a laughable circumstance took place on
his going to the same house a few nights back which has already been
made the subject much merriment both in conversation and caricature
it appears that mr gloss'em who is a shining character in the
theatrical world at least among the minors the metropolis and whose
father was for many years a waxchandler in the neighbourhood soho
holds a situation as clerk the cheque to the gentlemen pensioners
 his majesty's household as well as that major domo manager and
proprietor a certain theatre not half a mile from waterloo bridge
a part his duty in the former capacity is to attend occasionally
upon the person the king as one the appendages royalty in
which character he appeared on the night in question the servants
 the attendants who were in waiting for their masters had a room
appropriated to their use one these latter gentry no other than
gloss'em's servant being anxious to have as near a view the sacred
person his majesty as his employer had placed himself in a good
situation at the door in order to witness his departure when a mr
winpebble mismanaging notoriety and also a ponderous puff assuming
managerial authority espying him desired the policeofficers and
guards in attendance to turn out the lamplighter's boy pointing to
gloss'em's servant this it seems was no sooner said than done at the
point the bayonet some little scuffle ensued his majesty and suite
departed hold up your arm sir
but did the matter there enquired dashall
o dear no not exactly
because if it did continued tom in my opinion it began with a wax
taper and ended in the smoke a farthing rush light you have made it
appear to be a gasreceiver without supplies
i beg pardon said mr w the pipes are full but the gas is not yet
turned on
this created a laugh and mr w proceeded
the next day the servant having informed his master the treatment
he had received a gentleman was dispatched from gloss'em to winpebble
to demand an apology which being refused the former with a large
horsewhip under his arm accosted the latter and handsomely belaboured
his shoulders with lusty stripes that you see sir sets the gas all
in a blaze that will do sir now sir at your service addressing
himself to tallyhoho
yes said tom the taper's alight again now and pray what was the
consequence
winpebble called for assistance which was soon obtained and away they
went to bowstreet manager taper and manager vapour the one blazing
with fire and the other exhausted with thrashing twas a laughing
scene manager struts and manager butt were strutting and butting
each other the magistrate heard the case and recommended peace and
quietness between them by an amicable adjustment the irritated
minds the now two enraged managers could not be brought to consent
to this gloss'em declared the piece should be repeated having been
received with the most rapturous applause winpebble roundly swore that
the piece was ill got up badly represented and damn'd to all intents
and purposes that the author had more strength than wit and though
not a friend to injunctions himself he moved for an injunction against
gloss'em who was at length something like the renowned john ashley with
his imitator trees
this great john ashley and this little tommy trees were both bound
over to keep the king's peas
gloss'em was bound to keep the peace and compelled to find security
in the sum twenty pounds thus ended the farce the enraged
managers drury lane in a blaze or bow street bewildered 
ha ha ha an animated sort vehicle for public amusement truly
said tom and course produced with new scenery music dresses and
decorations forming a combination attractions superior to any ever
exhibited at any theatre egad it would make a most excellent scene ina
new pantomime
ha ha ha said mr w true sir true and the duel lord
shampetre would have also its due portion effect but as his
lordship is a good customer mine you must excuse any remarks on that
circumstance
we have already heard his lordship's undaunted courage and firmness
as well as the correctness his aim
he he he chuckled w then i fancy your information is not very
correct for it appears his lordship displayed a want every one 
those qualities that you impute to him however i venture to hope no
unpleasant measures will result from the occurrence as i made the very
pantaloons he wore upon the occasion it seems he is considerably cut
up but you must know that previous to the duel i was consulted
upon the best mode securing his sacred person from the effects a
bullet i recommended a very high waistband lined with whalebone and
well padded with horsehair to serve as a breastplate and calculated
at once to produce warmth and resist penetration the pantaloons
were accordingly made thickly overlaid with extremely rich and
expensive gold lace and considered to be stiff enough for anything
aye even to keep his lordship erect but what do you suppose was
the effect all my care i should not like to make a common talk
 it but so it certainly was his lordship had no objection to the
whalebone buckram c outside him but was fearful that if his
antagonist's fire should be welldirected his tender body might be
additionally hurt by the splinters the whalebone being carried along
with it and actually proposed to take them off before the dreadful hour
 appointment came on in this however he was fortunately overruled by
his second who by the by was but a goose in the affair and managed
it altogether very badly except in the instance being prompt with
the smellingbottle which certainly was welltimed and it would have
been a hissing hot business but for the judicious interference the
other second
a loud laugh succeeded this additional piece information relative
to the affair honour and snip having finished his measurement
colours were fixed upon and he departed promising to be punctual in
the delivery the new habiliments on the next day
i am now convinced said bob the great importance and utility 
a london tradesman and the speed their execution is wonderful
yes replied tom it is only to be equalled by the avidity with which
they obtain information and the rapidity with which they circulate
it why in another half hour your personal appearance the cut 
your country coat your complexion and character as far as so short
an interview would allow for obtaining it will be known to all his
customers they are generally quick and acute discerners but come
we must be making ready for our walk it is now halfpast ten
o'clock sparkle will be here presently it is time to be dressing as i
mean to have a complete ramble during the day take a chop somewhere
on the road and in the evening my boy we'll take a peep into the
theatre lord byron's tragedy marino falter is to be performed
tonight and i can i think promise you a treat the highest kind
tallyhoho who had no idea dressing again having already been obliged
to dress twice seemed a little surprised at the proposition but
supposing it to be the custom london nodded assent and
proceeded to the dressingroom as he walked up stairs he could not help
casting his visual orbs over the banisters just to take a bird's eye
view the scene his morning disasters which to his great
astonishment and surprise not a vestige remained a new lamp had been
procured which seemed to have arisen like a phoenix from its ashes and
the stone passage and stairs appeared as he termed it as white as a
cauliflower at the sight all this he was gratified and delighted
for he expected to find a heap ruins to reproach him he skipped or
rather vaulted up the stairs three or four at a stride with all the
gaiety a racehorse when first brought to the startingpost the
rapid movements a life in london at once astonished and enraptured
him nor did he delay his steps or his delight until he had reached
the topmost story when bursting open the door lie marched boldly into
the room here again he was at fault a female shriek assailed his ear
which stopped his course and looking around him he could not find from
whence the voice proceeded good god continued the same voice what
can be the meaning this intrusion begone rash man in the meantime
tom who was in a room just under the one into which he had
unfortunately made so sudden an entrance appeared at the door
what the devil is the matter now said tom when spying his cousin
in the centre the room without seeming to know whether to return or
remain he could not restrain his laughter tallyhoho looked up like one
in a dream then down then casting his eyes around him he perceived
in the corner peeping out from the bedcurtains in which she had
endeavoured to hide her almost naked person the head the old
housekeeper the picture was moving and at the same time laughable
the confusion bob the fright the housekeeper and the laughter 
tom were subjects for the pencil a hogarth
so said tom you are for springing game in all parts the house
and at all times too how came you here not by my appointment sir
replied the old lady who still remained rolled up in the curtain i
never did such a thing in all my born days i'm an honest woman and
mean to remain so i never was so ashamed in all my life
i believe the house is enchanted cried bob d me i never
seem to step without being on a barrel gunpowder ready to ignite
with the touch my foot i have made some cursed blunder again and
don't seem to know where i am
come come said dashall that won't do i'm sure you had some design
upon my housekeeper who you hear by her own account is a good woman
and won't listen to your advances
by this time the servants had arrived at the door and were alternately
peeping in wondering to see the two gentlemen in such a situation and
secretly giggling and enjoying the embarrassment the old woman
whose wig lay on the table and who was displaying her bald pate and
shrivelled features from the bedcurtains enveloped in fringe and
tassels which only served to render them still more ludicrous
bob affected to laugh said it was very odd he could not account for
it at all stammered out something like an apology begg'd pardon it
was a mistake he really took it for his own room he never was
so bewildered in his life was very sorry he should cause so much
alarm but really had no sort intention whatever
well said dashall the best reparation you can now make for your
intrusion is a speedy retreat time is escaping so come along and
taking him by the arm they walked down the stairs together and then
proceeded to refit without further obstruction in order to be ready
for sparkle who was expected every minute
the first day bob's residence in london had already been productive
 some curious adventures in which he unfortunately as he considered
had sustained the principal character a character not altogether
suitable to is inclinations or wishes though productive much
merriment to his ever gay and sprightly cousin who had witnessed the
embarrassment his pupil upon his first entrance into life with
ungovernable laughter it was to him excellent sport while it furnished
a good subject speculation and conversation among the servants below
but was not so well relished by the affrighted old housekeeper indeed
the abrupt entrance a man into her bedchamber had so deranged her
ideas that she was longer than usual in decking her person previous to
her reappearance the tender frame the old lady had been
subjected to serious agitations at the bare idea such a visit and
the probable imputations that might in consequence be thrown upon her
sacred and unspotted character nor could she for some time recover her
usual serenity
such was the situation the parties at the moment we are now
describing but as our heroes are preparing for an extensive actual
survey men manners and tidings we shall for the present leave them
in peace and quietness while we proceed to the next chapter
chapter vii
what shows and what sights what a round delights
you'll meet in the gay scene london
how charming to view amusements still new
twenty others you'll find soon as one's done
at the gay scene at court peers and gentry resort
in pleasure you'll never miss one day
there's the opera treat the parade in bond street
and the crowd in hyde park on a sunday
tom whose wardrobe was extensive found no difficulty and lost no
time in preparing for the promenade while on the other hand tallyhoho
was perplexed to know how to tog himself out in a way suitable to
make his appearance in the gay world fashion dashall had therefore
rapidly equipped himself when perceiving it was halfpast eleven
he was the more perplexed to account for the absence sparkle for
although it was an early hour yet upon such an occasion as that 
initiating a new recruit it was very extraordinary that he should not
have been prompt however he entered tallyhoho's room and found him
looking out the window in a posture rumination probably revolving
in his mind the events the morning
come said tom as he entered tis time to be on the move and if
sparkle don't show in a few minutes we'll set sail and call in upon him
at long's in bond street perhaps he is not well or something prevents
his appearance we'll make it in our way and we have a fine day before
us
i am at your service replied bob who could not help viewing the
elegance his cousin's appearance the style his dress and the
neatness with which his garments fitted him were all subjects 
admiration and formed so strong a contrast with his own as almost
to excite envy he had however attired himself in a way that befits a
fashionable country gentleman a green coat white waistcoat buckskin
breeches and boots over which a pair leggings appeared which
extended below the calf the leg and half up the thigh surmounted
with a lily shallow such was the costume in which he was destined to
show off and thus equipped after a few minutes they emerged from the
house in piccadilly on the proposed ramble and proceeded towards bond
street
the first object that took their particular attention was the burlington
arcade come said tom we may as well go this way and immediately
they passed the man in the goldlaced hat who guards the entrance to
prevent the admission boys and improper persons the display the
shops with the sun shining through the windows above afforded much for
observation and attracted bob from side to side to look to wonder and
admire but tom who was intent upon finding his friend sparkle urged
the necessity moving onward with more celerity lest he should begone
out and consequently kept drawing his cousin forward another and
a better opportunity will be afforded for explanation than the present
and as speed is the order the day i hope you will not prove
disorderly we shall soon reach long's and when we have sparkle with
us we have one the most intelligent and entertaining fellows in
the world he is a sort index to every thing and every body his
knowledge life and character together with a facetiousness 
whim and manner which he has in delineating them are what we call
in london prime and bang up to the mark there is scarcely a lane
court alley or street in the metropolis but what he knows from the
remotest corners ragfair to the open and elegant squares the
west even to hyde park corner memory mirth and magic seem at all
times to animate his tongue and as the song says
he is the hoy for bewitching em
whether goodhumour'd or coy
indeed he is the admiration all who know him wit whim frolic
and fun are constant companions with him and i really believe in a
dungeon or a palace he would always appear the same
by this time they had reached bond street in their way to which
each step they had taken the streets and avenues every description
appeared to bob to be crowded to an excess the mingling cries which
were vociferated around them produced in his mind uncommon
sensations the rattling the carriages the brilliance the shops
and the continual hum the passengers contributed to heighten the
scene
bond street said dashall is not one the most elegant streets
in the vicinity london but is the resort the most fashionable
people and from about two o'clock till five it is all bustle all
life every species fashionable vehicle is to be seen dashing
along in gay and gallant pride from two to five are the fashionable
shoppinghours for which purpose the first families resort to this
wellknown street others to shew their equipage make an assignation
or kill a little time which is as much a business with some as is the
more careful endeavours others to seize him in his flight and make
the most his presence the throng is already increasing the variety
richness and gaiety the shops in this street will always be
attractive and make it a popular rendezvous both sexes it will
shortly be as crowded as rag fair or the royal exchange and the magic
splendour has very peculiar properties
it makes the tradesman forget while he is cheating a lovely and
smiling duchess that in all probability her ladyship is endeavouring to
cheat him it makes the gay and airy the furrowed and painted lady 
the town forget that she must pay a visit to her uncle in order
to raise the wind before she can make her appearance at the theatre
at halfprice it makes the dashing prisoner forget that while he
is sporting his figure in the bangup style appearance he is only
taking his ride on a dayrule from the king's bench it makes the lord
who drives fourinhand forget his losses the night before at some 
the fashionable gaminghouses it makes one adventurer forget that the
clothes in which he expects to obtain respect and attention are more
than likely to be paid for in newgate another for a time forgets that
john doe and richard roe have expelled him from his
 my uncle is a very convenient and accommodating sort 
friend who lives at the sign the three balls indicative
 his willingness to lend money upon good security for the
payment enormous interest the original meaning the
sign has puzzled the curious and antiquarians and the only
probable meaning they can discover is that it implies the
chances are two to one against any property being redeemed
after being once committed to the keeping this tenderhearted
and affectionate relative
lodgings and a third that all his worldly possessions are not equal
to the purchase a dinner it is an ignis fatuus a sort magic
lantern replete with delusive appearances momentary duration an
escape to the regions noise tumult vanity and frivolity where the
realities life the circumstances and the situation the observer
are not suffered to intrude
but to be seen in this street at a certain hour is one the
essentials to the existence hautton it is the point attraction
for greetings in splendid equipages from the haughty bend or familiar
nod arrogance to the humble bow servility here mimicry without
money assumes the consequential air independence while modest merit
creeps along unheeded through the glittering crowd here all the senses
are tantalized with profusion and the eye is dazzled with temptation
for no other reason than because it is the constant business a
fashionable life not to live in but out self to imitate the
luxuries the affluent without a tithe their income and to
sacrifice morality at the altar notoriety
your description this celebrated street which i have heard so
much said tallyhoho is truly lively
but it is strictly true continued tom
they had now arrived at long's and found a barouche and four waiting at
the door upon entering the first person they met was lord cripplegate
whom they passed and proceeded to the coffeeroom in one the
boxes which tom immediately directed his cousin's attention to a
welldressed young man who was reading the newspaper and sipping his
coffee take notice him said tom
bob looked at him for a moment marked his features and his dress
which was in the extreme fashion while tom turning to one the
waiters enquired for his friend sparkle
he has not been here since yesterday morning said the waiter
i have been waiting for him these two hours exclaimed the young sprig
 fashion laying down the newspaper almost at the same moment and
must wait till he comes ah mr dashall how d'ye dovery glad to
see you left all well in the country i hope mr sparkle was to have
met me this morning at eleven precisely i should judge he is gone into
the country
it must have been late last night then said dashall for he
left us about halfpast ten and promised also to meet us again this
morning at eleven i can't think what can have become him but come
said he taking bob by the arm we must keep moving good morning good
morning and thus saying walked directly out the house turning to
the right again towards piccadilly
there is a remark made i think by goldsmith said tom that one half
 the world don't know how the other half lives and the man i spoke to
in the coffeeroom whose name i am unacquainted with though his person
is recognized by almost every body while his true character residence
and means subsistence remain completely in obscurity from what i
have seen him i judge is what may be termed a hanger on 
a hanger on said bob what can that mean i took him for a man 
property and high birth but i saw you take so little notice him
ah my good fellow i have already cautioned you not to be duped by
appearances a hanger on is a sort sycophant or toadeater
and in the coffeehouses and hotels london many such are to be
found men who can spin out a long yarn tell a tough story and
tip you a rum chant who invite themselves by a freedom address
bordering on impudence to the tables and the parties persons they
know by pretending to call in by mere accident just at the appointed
time by assuming great confidence great haste little appetite and
much business but at the same time requiring but little pressure to
forego them all for the pleasure the company present what he
can have to do with sparkle i am at a loss to conceive but he is an
insinuating and an intriguing sort fellow whom i by no means like
so i cut him
bob did not exactly understand the meaning the word cut and
therefore begged his cousin to explain
the cut said tom is a fashionable word for getting rid by rude
or any means any person whose company is not agreeable the art 
cutting is reduced to a system in london and an explanatory treatise
has been written on the subject for the edification the natives
but i am so bewildered to think what can have detained sparkle and
deprived us his company that i scarcely know how to think for a
moment on any other subject at present
 vide a small volume entitled the cutter
it is somewhat strange cried bob that he was not with you this
morning
there is some mystery in it said tom which time alone can unravel
but however we will not be deprived our intended ramble at this
moment they entered piccadilly and were crossing the road in their way
to st james's street when dashall nodded to a gentleman passing by on
the opposite side and received a sort half bow in return that
said tom is a curious fellow and a devilish clever fellow too for
although he has but one arm he is a man science
in what way enquired bob
he is a pugilist said tom one those courageous gentlemen who can
queer the daylight tap the claret prevent telling fibs and pop the
noddle into chancery and a devilish good hand he is i can assure you
among those who
can combat with ferocious strife
and beat an eye out or thump out a life
can bang the ribs in or bruise out the brains
and die like noble blockheads for their pains
illustration pages fives court
having but one arm course he is unable to figure in the
ring though he attends the mills and is a constant visitor at the
fives court exhibitions and generally appears a la beecher he prides
himself upon flooring a novice and hits devilish hard with the glove i
have had some lessons from this amateur the old english science and
felt the force his fist but it is a very customary thing to commence
in a friendly way till the knowing one finds an opportunity which he
cannot resist shewing the superiority he possesses so it was with
harry and me when he put on his glove i use the singular number
because he has but one hand whereon to place a glove withal come said
he it shall only be a little innocent spar i also put on a glove
for it would not be fair to attack a onearmed man with two and no one
ought to take the odds in combat to it we went and i shewed first
blood for he tapped the claret in no time
neat milling we had what with clouts on the nob home hits in
the breadbasket clicks in the gob and plumps in the daylight a
prettier treat between two johnny raws tis not easy to meet
i profited however by harry's lessons and after a short time was
enabled to return the compliment with interest by sewing up one his
glimmers 
this is st james's street continued he as they turned the corner
rather short in doing which somewhat animated by the description he
had just been giving tom's foot caught the toe a gentleman who
was mincing along the pathway with all the care and precision a
dancingmaster which had the effect bringing him to the ground in an
instant as effectually as a blow from one the fancy tom who had
no intention giving offence wantonly apologized for the misfortune
by i beg pardon sir while bob who perceived the poor creature was
unable to rise again and apprehending some broken bones assisted him
to regain his erect position the poor animal or nondescript yclept
dandy however had only been prevented the exercise its limbs by the
stiffness certain appendages without which its person could not be
complete the stays lined with whalebone were the obstacles to its
rising being however placed in its natural position he began in an
affected blustering tone voice to complain that it was d d odd
a gentleman could not walk along the streets without being incommoded
by puppies pulled out his quizzing glass and surveyed our heroes from
head to foot then taking from his pocket a smelling bottle which by
application to the nose appeared to revive him tom declared he was
sorry for the accident had no intention and hoped he was not hurt
this however did not appear to satisfy the offended dandy who turned
upon his heel muttering to himself the necessity there was preventing
drunken fellows from rambling the streets to the annoyance sober and
genteel people in the daytime
dashall who overheard the substance his ejaculation broke from the
arm bob and stepping after him without ceremony by a sudden wheel
placed himself in the front him so as to impede his progress a
second time a circumstance which filled mr fribble with additional
alarm and his agitation became visibly depicted on his countenance
what do you mean cried dashall with indignation taking the
imputation drunkenness at that early hour in dudgeon who and
what are you sir explain instantly or by the honour a
gentleman i'll chastise this insolence
 what are you is a formidable question to a dandy the
present day for
dandy's a gender the doubtful kind
a something nothing not to be defined
twould puzzle worlds its sex to ascertain
so very empty and so very vain
it is a fact that the following examination three 
these nondescripts took place at bow street a very short
time back in consequence a nocturnal fracas the report
was thus given
three young sprigs fashion in full dress somewhat
damaged and discoloured by a night's lodging in the cell 
a watchhouse were yesterday brought before mr birnie
charged with disorderly conduct in the streets and with
beating a watchman named lloyd
lloyd stated that his beat was near the piazza and at a
very late hour on thursday night the three defendants came
through covent garden singing and conducting themselves in
the most riotous manner possible they were running and
were followed by three others all in a most uproarious
state intoxication and he thought proper to stop them
upon which he was floored sanceremonie and when he
recovered his legs he was again struck and called a b y
charley and other ungenteel names he called for
the assistance some his brethren and the defendants
were with some trouble taken to the watchhouse they were
very jolly on the way and when lodged in durance amused
themselves with abusing the constable the night and took
especial care that no one within hearing the watchhouse
should get a wink sleep for the remainder the night
mr birnie well young gentleman what have you to say to
this the one who undertook to be spokesman threw himself
in the most familiar manner possible across the table and
having fixed himself perfectly at his ease he said the
fact was they had been dining at a tavern and were rather
drunk and on their way through the piazza they endeavoured
by running away to give the slip to their three companions
who were still worse than themselves the others however
called out stop thief and the watchman stopped them
whereat they naturally felt irritated and certainly gave
the watchman a bit a thrashing
mr birnie how was he to know you were not the thieves
he did quite right to stop you and i am very glad he has
brought you here pray sir what are you defendant i
am nothing sir mr birnie to another and what are
you defendant why sir i am i am sir nothing mr
birnie well this is very fine pray sir turning to
the third who stood twirling his hat will you do me the
favour to tell what you are
this gentleman answered in the same way i am as my
friends observed nothing
mr birnie well gentlemen i must endeavour to make
something you here gaoler let them he locked up and i
shall not part with them until i have some better account 
their occupations
we have heard it asserted that nine tailors make a man how
many dandies professing to be nothing may be required to
accomplish the proposed intention making something may
perhaps by this time be discovered by the worthy
magistrate we however suspect he has had severe work it
leave me alone exclaimed the almost petrified dandy
not till you have given me the satisfaction i have a right to demand
cried tom i insist upon an explanation and apology or demand your
card who are you sir that's my address instantly handing him a
card i am not to be played with nor will i suffer your escape after
the insulting manner in which you have spoken with impunity
though not prepared for such a rencontre the dandy who now perceived
the inflexible temper tom's mind and a crowd people gathering
round him determined at least to put on as much the character a
man as possible and fumbled in his pocket for a card at length finding
one he slipped it into tom's hand oh sir said he if that's the
case i'm your man demise how when or where you please pon
honor then beckoning to a hackney coach he hobbled to the door
and was pushed in by coaches who immediately mounted the box and
flourishing his whip soon rescued him from his perilous situation and
the jeers the surrounding multitude
tom who in the bustle the crowd had slipped the card his
antagonist into his pocket now took bob's arm and they pursued their
way down st james's street and could not help laughing at the affair
but tallyhoho who had a great aversion to duelling and was thinking 
the consequences bit his lips and expressed his sorrow at what
had occurred he ascribed the hasty imputation drunkenness to the
irritating effects the poor creature's accident and expressed his
hope that his cousin would take no further notice it tom however
on the other hand ridiculed bob's fears told him it was a point
 honour not to suffer an insult in the street from any man nor would
he besides the charge drunkenness from such a thing as that is not
to be borne d n it man drunkenness in the early part the day
is a thing i abhor it is at all times what i would avoid if possible
but at night there may be many apologies for it nay in some cases even
to avoid it is impossible the pleasures society are enhanced
by it the joys love are increased by the circulation the
glass harmony conviviality and friendship are produced by it though i
am no advocate for inebriety and detest the idea the beast
who clouds his reason by the light day
and falls to drink an early and an easy prey
well said bob i cannot help thinking this poor fellow who has
already betrayed his fears will be inclined to make any apology for his
rudeness tomorrow
if he does not said tom i'll wing him to a certainty a
jackanapes a puppy a manmilliner perhaps a thing shreds and
patches he shall not go unpunished i promise you so come along we
will just step in here and i'll dispatch this business at once i'll
write a challenge and then it will be off my hands and so saying
they entered a coffeehouse where calling for pen ink and paper tom
immediately began his epistle shrewdly hinting to his cousin that he
expected he would act as his second it will be a fine opportunity for
introducing your name to the gay world the newspapers will record your
name as a man ton let us see now how it will appear on last
the honourable tom dashall attended by his cousin robert tallyhoho esq
 belleville hall met ah by the bye let us see who he is here he
felt in his pocket for the card
bob however declared his wish to decline obtaining popularity by being
present upon such an occasion and suggested the idea his calling
upon the offender and endeavouring to effect an amicable arrangement
between them
hallo exclaimed tom with surprise as he drew the card from his
pocket and threw it on the table ha ha ha look at that
tallyhoho looked at the card without understanding it what does it
mean said he
mean replied tom why it is a pawnbroker's duplicate for a
hunting watch deposited with his uncle this morning in st martin's
lane for two pounds laughable enough well you may dismiss your fears
for the present but i'll try if i can't find my man by this means if
he is worth finding at all events we have found a watch
bob now joined in the laugh and having satisfied the waiter they
sallied forth again
just as they left the coffeehouse do you see that gentleman in the
blue great coat arm in arm with another that is no other than the
you would scarcely conceive by his present appearance that
he has commanded armies and led them on to victory and that having
retired under the shade his laurels he is withering them away
leaf by leaf by attendance at the hells the metropolis his
unconquerable spirit still actuating him in his hours relaxation it
is said that the immense sum awarded to him for his prowess in war
has been so materially reduced by his inordinate passion for play that
although he appears at court and is a favourite the demon poverty
stares him in the face but this is a vile world and half one hears is
not to be believed he is certainly extravagant fond women and fond
 wine but all these foibles are overshadowed with so much glory as
scarcely to remain perceptible here is the palace said tom directing
his cousin's attention to the bottom the street
bob was evidently struck at this piece information as he could
discover no mark grandeur in its appearance to entitle it to the
dignity a royal residence
it is true said tom the outside appearance is not much in its
favour but it is venerable for its antiquity and for its being till
lately the place at which the kings this happy island have held their
courts on the site that palace originally stood an hospital
founded before the conquest for fourteen leprous females to whom eight
brethren were afterwards added to assist in the performance divine
service
very necessary said bob and yet scarcely sufficient
 hells the abode or resort blacklegs or gamblers
where they assemble to commit their depredations on the
unwary but these we shall have occasion to enlarge
elsewhere
you seem to quiz this palace and are inclined to indulge your wit
upon old age in it was surrendered to henry viii and he erected
the present palace and enclosed st james's park to serve as a place
 amusement and exercise both to this palace and whitehall but it
does not appear to have been the court the english sovereigns during
their residence in town till the reign queen ann from which time it
has been uniformly used as such
it is built brick and that part which contains the state
apartments being only one story high gives it a regular appearance
outside the staterooms are commodious and handsome although there is
nothing very superb or grand in the decorations or furniture
the entrance to these rooms is by a staircase which opens into the
principal court which you now see at the top the staircase are
two rooms one on the left called the queen's and the other the king's
guardroom leading to the stateapartments immediately beyond the
king's guardroom is the presencechamber which contains a canopy
and is hung with tapestry and which is now used as a passage to the
principal rooms
there is a suite five rooms opening into each other successively
fronting the park the presencechamber opens into the centre room
which is denominated the privychamber in which is a canopy 
floweredcrimson velvet generally made use for the king to receive
the quakers
on the right are two drawingrooms one within the other at the upper
 the further one is a throne with a splendid canopy on which the
kings have been accustomed to receive certain addresses this is called
the grand drawingroom and is used by the king and queen on certain
state occasions the nearer room being appropriated as a kind 
antechamber in which the nobility c are permitted to remain while
their majesties are present in the further room and is furnished with
stools sofas c for the purpose there are two leveerooms on the
left the privychamber on entering from the king's guardroom and
presencechamber the nearer one serving as an antechamber to the
other they were all them formerly meanly furnished but at the
time the marriage our present king they were elegantly fitted
up the walls are now covered with tapestry very beautiful and rich
colours tapestry which although it was made for charles had
never been used having by some accident lain unnoticed in a chest till
it was discovered a short time before the marriage the prince
the canopy the throne was made for the latequeen's birthday the
first which happened after the union great britain and ireland it
is made crimson velvet with very broad gold lace embroidered with
crowns set with fine and rich pearls the shamrock emblematical the
irish nation forms a part the decorations the british crown and
is executed with great taste and accuracy
the grand drawingroom contains a large magnificent chandelier 
silver gilt but i believe it has not been lighted for some years and
in the grand leveeroom is a very noble bed the furniture which is
 spitalfields manufacture in crimson velvet it was first put up with
the tapestry on the marriage the present king then prince wales
it is upon the whole an irregular building chiefly consisting 
several courts and alleys which lead into the park this however is
the age improvement and it is said that the palace will shortly
be pulled down and in the front st james's street a magnificent
triumphal arch is to be erected to commemorate the glorious victories
 the late war and to form a grand entrance to the park
the duke york the duke clarence the king's servants and many
other dignified persons live in the stableyard
in the stableyard said bob dignified persons reside in a
stableyard you astonish me
it is quite true said tom and remember it is the stableyard a
king
i forgot that circumstance said bob and that circumstances alter
cases but whose carriage is this driving with so much rapidity
that is his highness the duke york most likely going to pay a visit
to his royal brother the king who resides in a palace a little further
on which will be in our way for it is yet too early to see much in
the park so let us proceed i am anxious to make some inquiry about
my antagonist and therefore mean to take st martin's lane as we go
along
with this they pursued their way along pall mall the rapidity tom's
movements however afforded little opportunity for observation or remark
till they arrived opposite carlton house when he called his
cousin's attention to the elegance the new streets opposite to it
that said he is waterloo place which as well as the memorable
battle after which it is named has already cost the nation an immense
sum money and must cost much more before the proposed improvements
are completed it is however the most elegant street in london the
want uniformity the buildings has a striking effect and gives it
the appearance a number palaces in the time queen elizabeth
there were no such places as pall mall st james'sstreet piccadilly
nor any the streets or fine squares in this part the town that
building at the farther is now the british fireoffice and has a
pleasing effect at this distance the cupola on the left belongs to a
chapel the interior which for elegant simplicity is unrivalled to
the left the centre building is a circus and a serpentine street
not yet finished which runs to swallow street and thence directly
to oxford road where another circus is forming and is intended to
communicate with portland place by which means a line street
composed all new buildings will be completed this dull looking
place turning to carlton house although it is the townresidence
 our king i shall say nothing at present as i intend devoting a
morning along with you to its inspection the exterior has not the
most lively appearance but the interior is magnificent during this
conversation they had kept moving gently on
illustration pages the kings levee
bob was charmed with the view down waterloo place
that said his cousin pointing to the arcade at the opposite corner
 pall mall is the italian operahouse which has recently assumed
its present superb appearance and may be ranked among the finest
buildings in london it is devoted to the performance italian operas
and french ballets is generally open from december to july and
is attended by the most distinguished and fashionable persons the
improvements in this part are great that church which you see in the
distance over the tops the houses is st martin's in the fields
in the fields inquired bob what then are we come to the the
town
ha ha ha cried tom the no no i was going to say
there is no to it no we have not reached any thing like the
centre
blood an owns moderation and blarney said an irishman at that
moment passing them with a hod mortar on his shoulder towards the
new buildings and leaving an ornamental patch as he went along on bob's
shoulder but i'll be after tipping turnips l to any b dy
rogue that's tip to saying black's the white the blue part pat
murphy's eye and for that there matter dropping the hod mortar
almost on their toes at the same time and turning round to bob by the
powers i ax the jontleman's pardon tho he's not the first jontleman
that has carried mortar where is that big bullyfaced blackguard
that i'm looking after during this he brushed the mortar off tallyhoho's
coat with a snap his fingers regardless where or on whom he
distributed it
the offender it seemed had taken flight while pat was apologizing and
was no where to be found
why what's the matter inquired tom you seem in a passion
och not in the least bit your honour i'm only in a d d rage by
the mug my mother arn't it a great shame that a jontleman 
ireland can't walk the streets london without having potatoes and
buttermilk throned in his gums hitching up the waistband his
breeches it won't do at all at all for pat its a reflection on my own
native land where
is hospitality
all reality
no formality
there you ever see
the free and easy
would so amaze ye
you'd think us all crazy
for dull we never be
these lines sung with an irish accent to the tune morgan rattler
accompanied with a snapping his fingers and concluded with a
something in imitation 
 tipping turnips this is a phrase made use among the
rigging fraternity to signify a turnup which is to
knock down
an irish jilt were altogether so truly characteristic the
nation to which he belonged as to afford our heroes considerable
amusement tom threw him a halfcrown which he picked up with more
haste than he had thrown down the mortar in his rage
long life and good luck to the jontleman said pat sure enough
i won't be after drinking health and success to your honour's pretty
picture and the devil pitch into his own cabin the fellow that would
be after picking a hole or clapping a dirty patch on the coat st
patrick whiskey for ever your honour huzza
a drop good whiskey
would make a man frisky
by this time a crowd was gathering round them and tom cautioned bob ina
whisper to beware his pockets this piece advice however came
too late for his blue bird's eye wipe l had taken flight
what said bob is this done in open day are you all right and
tight elsewhere said tom if you are toddle on and say nothing about
it open day continued he aye the system rigging 
 blue bird's eye wipe a blue pocket handkerchief with
white spots
 a cant term for all sorts thieving the life the
celebrated george barrington old bailey notoriety is
admirably illustrative this art which by a more recent
development hardy vaux appears to be almost reduced to
a system notwithstanding the wholesomeness our laws and
the vigilance our police in their administration however
incredible it may appear such is the force habit and
association the latter notwithstanding he was detected and
transported contrived to continue his depredations during
his captivity returned at the expiration his term to
his native land and his old pursuits was transported a
second time suffered flogging and imprisonmeets without
correcting what cannot but be termed the vicious
propensities his nature he generally spent his mornings
in visiting the shops jewellers watchmakers
pawnbrokers c depending upon his address and appearance
and determining to make the whole circuit the metropolis
and not to omit a single shop in either those branches
this scheme he actually executed so fully that he believes
he did not leave ten untried in london for he made a point
 commencing early every day and went regularly through
it taking both sides the way his practice on entering a
shop was to request to look at gold seals chains
brooches rings or any other small articles value
and while examining them and looking the shopkeeper in the
face he contrived by sleight hand to conceal two or
three sometimes more as opportunities offered in the
sleeve his coat which was purposely made wide in this
practice he succeeded to a very great extent and in the
course his career was never once detected in the fact
though on two or three occasions so much suspicion arose
that he was obliged to exert all his effrontery and to use
very high language in order as the cant phrase is to
bounce the tradesman out it his fashionable appearance
and affected anger at his insinuations always had the
effect inducing an apology and in many such cases he has
actually carried away the spoil notwithstanding what passed
between them and even gone so far as to visit the same shop
again a second and a third time with as good success as at
first this with his nightly attendance at the theatres and
places public resort where he picked pockets watches
snuffboxes c was for a length time the sole business
 his life he was however secured after secreting himself
for a time convicted and is now transported for life ashe
conceives sold by another celebrated prig whose real
name was bill white but better known by the title coney
beau
will be acted on sometimes by the very party you are speaking
to the expertness with which it is done is almost beyond belief
bob having ascertained that his handkerchief was the extent his loss
they pursued their way towards charing cross
a line street is intended continued tom to be made from the
opera house to terminate with that church and here is the king's mews
which is now turned into barracks
stop thief stop thief was at this moment vociferated in their ears
by a variety voices and turning round they perceived a welldressed
man at full speed followed pretty closely by a concourse people ina
moment the whole neighbourhood appeared to be in alarm the upstairs
windows were crowded with females the tradesmen were at their
shopdoors the passengers were huddled together in groups inquiring 
each other what is the matter who is it which is him what has he
done while the pursuers were increasing in numbers as they went the
bustle the scene was new to bob charing cross and its vicinity was
all in motion
come said tom let us see the this they are sure to nab l
my gentleman before he gets much
 nabbed or nibbled secured or taken
farther so let us brush on then pulling his cousin by the
arm they moved forward to the scene action
as they approached st martin's lane the gathering the crowd which
was now immense indicated to tom a capture
button up said he and let us see what's the matter
arrah be easy cried a voice which they instantly recognized to be no
other than pat murphy's i'll hold you my dear till the night after
doomsday though i can't tell what day the year that is where's the
man wit the gouldlaced skullcap sure enough i thought i'd be up wi
you and so now you see i'm down upon you
at this moment a streetkeeper made way through the crowd and tom
and bob keeping close in his rear came directly up to the principal
performers in this interesting scene and found honest pat murphy
holding the man by his collar while he was twisting and writhing to get
released from the strong and determined grasp the athletic hibernian
pat no sooner saw our heroes than he burst out with a lusty arrow
arrow there's the sweetlooking gentleman that's been robbed by a dirty
spalpeen that's not worth the tail a rotten redherring i'll give
charge dis here pick'd whalebone a dead donkey that walks about in
god's own daylight darting his fingers wit what don't belong to him at
all at all so sure as the devil's in his own house and that's london
you've had your pocket pick'd my darling and that's news well worth
hearing addressing himself to dashall
by this harangue it was pretty clearly understood that murphy had been
in pursuit the pickpocket and tom immediately gave charge
the man however continued to declare he was not the right
person that so help him g d the irishman had got the wrong
bull by the tail that he was a b dy snitch and that he would
sarve him out that he wished
 brush be off
 snitch a term made use by the lightfingered tribe
to signify an informer by whom they have been impeached or
betrayed so a person who turns king's evidence against his
accomplices is called a snitch
 serve him out to punish or be revenged upon any person
for any real or supposed injury
he might meet him out st giles's and he would wake him
with an irish howl 
 wake with an irish howl an irish wake which is no
unfrequent occurrence in the neighbourhood st giles's
and saffron hill is one the most comically serious
ceremonies which can well be conceived and certainly
baffles all powers description it is however
considered indispensable to wake the body a deceased
native the sister kingdom which is by a sort mock
lying in state to which all the friends relatives and
fellow countrymen and women the dead person are
indiscriminately admitted and among the low irish this duty
is frequently performed in a cellar upon which occasions
the motley group assembled hibernian would form a
subject for the pencil the most able satirist
upon one these occasions when murtoch mulrooney who had
suffered the sentence the law by the common hangman fora
footpad robbery an englishman was induced by a friend 
the deceased to accompany him and has left on record the
following account his entertainment
when we had descended says he about a dozen steps we
found ourselves in a subterraneous region but fortunately
not uninhabited on the right sat three old bawds drinking
whiskey and smoking tobacco out pipes about two inches
long by which means i conceive their noses had become
red and swearing and blasting between each puff i was
immediately saluted by one the most sober the ladies
and invited to take a glass the enlivening nectar and
led to the bed exactly opposite the door where murtoch was
laid out and begged to pray for the repose his precious
should this however i declined alleging that as the
parsons were paid for praying it was their proper business
at this moment a coarse female voice exclaimed in a sort 
yell or irish howl arrah by jesus and why did you die
honey sure enough it was not for the want milk meal
or toes
in a remote corner the room or rather cellar sat three
draymen five his majesty's body guards four sailors
six haymakers eight chairmen and six evidence makers
together with three bailiffs followers who came by turns
to view the body and take a drop the cratur to drink
repose to the should their countryman and to complete the
group they were attended by the journeyman jack ketch the
noise and confusion were almost stupefying there were
praying swearing cryinghowling smoking and drinking
at the head the bed where the remains murtoch were
laid was the picture the virgin mary on one side and
that st patrick on the other and at the feet was
depicted the devil and some his angels with the blood
running down their backs from the flagellations which they
had received from the disciples ketigern whether the
blue devils were flying around or not i could not exactly
discover but the whiskey and blue ruin were evidently
powerful in their effects
one was swearing a second counting his beads a
third descanting on the good qualities his departed
friend and about to try those the whiskey a fourth
evacuating that load with which he had already overloaded
himself a fifth declaring he could carry a fare hear
mass knock down a member parliament murder a peace
officer and after all receive a pension and while the
priest was making an assignation with a sprightly female
sprig shelalah another was genteelly picking his pocket
i had seen enough and having no desire to continue in such
company made my escape with as much speed as i could from
this animated group persons assembled as they were upon
so solemn an occasion
with conversation this kind the party were amused up st
martin's lane and on the remainder the road to bowstreet followed
by many persons some whom pretended to have seen a part the
proceedings and promised to give their evidence before the magistrate
who was then sitting
on arriving in bow street they entered the brown bear a
publichouse much frequented by the officers and in which is a
strongroom for the safe custody prisoners where they were shewn
into a dark backparlour as they termed it and the officer proceeded
to search the man in custody when lo and behold the handkerchief was
not to be found about him
pat d d the devil and all his works swore by the fiery furnace 
beelzebub and that's the devil's own bedchamber that was the man
that nibbled the jontleman's dive and must have tinged away the
wipe or else what should he bolt for that he was up to the
rum slum 
 a former landlord the house facetiously christened it
the russian hotel and had the words painted under the sign
 bruin
 nibbled the jontleman's dive picked the gentleman's
pocket
 dined away the wipe passed away the handkerchief to
another to escape detection this is a very common practice
in london two or three in a party will be near without
appearing to have the least knowledge or connexion with
each other and the moment a depredation is committed by
one he transfers the property to one his pals by whom
it is conveyed perhaps to the third who decamps with it to
some receiver who will immediately advance money upon it
while if any suspicion should fall upon the first the
second will perhaps busy himself in his endeavours to secure
the offender well knowing no proof possession can be
brought against him
 bolt run away try to make an escape
 rum slum gammon queer talk or action in which some
fraudulent intentions are discoverable or suspected
and down upon the kiddies and sure enough you're boned 
my dear boy
some the officers came in and appeared to know the prisoner well
as if they had been acquainted with each other upon former official
business but as the lost property was not found upon him it was the
general opinion that nothing could be done and the accused began to
exercise his wit upon murphy which roused pat's blood
for the least thing you know makes an irishman roar
at length upon charging him with having been caught bluepigeon
flying pat gave him the lie in his teeth swore he'd fight him for
all the blunt he had about him which to be sure said he is
but a sweet pretty halfacrown and be d d to you good luck
to it here goes throwing the halfcrown upon the floor which the
prisoner attempted to pick up but was prevented by pat's stamping his
foot upon it while he was doffing his jacket exclaiming
arrah be after putting your dirty fingers in your pocket and don't
spoil the king's picture by touching it devil burn me but i'll mill
your mug to muffin dust before i'll give up that beautiful looking
bit so tip us your mauley and no more blarney
 down upon the kiddies to understand the arts and
manouvres thieves and sharpers
 boned taken or secured
s blue pigeon flying the practice stealing lead from
houses churches or other buildings a species 
depredation very prevalent in london and its vicinity and
which is but too much encouraged by the readiness with which
it can be disposed to the plumbers in general
 blunt a flash term for money
 doffing his jacket taking off his jacket
 mill your mug to muffin dust the peculiarity the irish
character for overstrained metaphor may perhaps in some
degree account for the hibernian's idea beating his head
to flour though he was afterwards inclined to commence his
operations in the true style and character the prize
ring where
men shake hands before they box then give each other
plaguy knocks with all the love and kindness a brother
 tip us your manley give me your hand honour is so sacred
a thing with the irish that the rapid transition from a
violent expression to the point honour is no uncommon
thing amongst them and in this instance it is quite clear
that although he meant to mill the mug his opponent to
muffin dust he had a notion the thing and intended to
do it in an honourable way
during this conversation the spectators who were numerous were
employed in endeavouring to pacify the indignant hibernian who by this
time had buffet it or in other words peeled in prime twig fora
regular turn to all was noise and confusion when a new group
 persons entered the room another capture had been made and another
charge given it was however with some difficulty that honest pat murphy
was prevailed upon to remain a little quiet while one the officers
beckoned dashall out the room and gave him to understand that the
man in custody just brought in was a wellknown pal the one
first suspected though they took not the least notice each other
upon meeting in the mean time another officer in the room had been
searching the person the last captured from whose bosom he drew the
identical handkerchief bob and the irishman recollected seeing him
in the crowd opposite the opera house
this cleared up the mystery in some degree though the two culprits
affected a total ignorance each otho what i said
to the blind man then go and look for him old chap says
i ha ha ha that's your sort my boy keep it up keep
it up d me that's the worst it i always turn
sick when i think a parson i always do and my brother
he is a parson too and he hates to hear any body swear so
you know i always swear like a trooper when i am near him
on purpose to roast him i went to dine with him one day
last week and there was my sisters and two or three more
 what you call your modest women but i sent em all from
the table and then laugh'd at em for i loves fun and
that was fun alive and so there was nobody in the room
but my brother and me and i begun to swear most sweetly i
never swore so well in all my life i swore all my new
oaths it would have done you good to have heard me swear
till at last my brother looked frightened and d me that
was good fun at last he lifted up his hands and eyes to
heaven and calls out o tempore o mores but i was not to
be done so oh oh brother says i what you think to
frighten me by calling all your family about you but i
don't care for you nor your family neither so stow it
i'll mill the whole troop only bring your tempore and mores
here that's all let us have fair play i'll tip em the
gas in a flash lightning i'll box em for five pounds
d me here where's tempore and mores where are they
my eyes how he did stare when he see me ready for a set to
i never laugh'd so in my life he made but two steps out 
the room and left me master the field what d'ye
think that for a lark eh keep it up keep it up d
me says i so i sets down to the table drank as much as i
could then i mix'd the heeltaps all in one bottle and
broke all the empty ones then bid adieu to tempore and
mores and rolled home in a hackneycoach in prime and
plummy order d me
coming along piccadilly last night after leaving you i was overtaken
at the corner rupertstreet by our old collegecompanion harry
farewell pursuing his way to the hummums where it seems he has taken
up his abode harry you remember never was exactly one us he
studies too much and pores everlastingly over musty old volumes 
law cases blackstone's commentaries and other black books to qualify
himself for the black art and as fit and proper person to appear at
the bar the length time that had elapsed since our last meeting was
sufficient inducement for us to crack a bottle together so taking
his arm we proceeded to the place destination where we sat talking
over past times and indulging our humour till halfpast one o'clock
when i sallied forth on my return to long's having altogether abandoned
my original intention calling in goldensquare at the corner 
leicestersquare my ears were assailed with a little the night
music the rattles were in full chorus and the charleys in prime
twig were mustering from all quarters
illustration pages tom and bob catching a charley napping
the street was all alive and i made my way through the crowd to the
immediate scene action which was rendered peculiarly interesting by
the discovery a dainty bit female beauty shewing fight with half
a dozen watchmen in order to extricate herself from the grasp these
guardians our peace she was evidently under the influence 
the bacchanalian god which invigorated her arm without imparting
discretion to her head and she laid about her with such dexterity that
the old files were fearful losing their prey but the odds were
fearfully against her and never did i feel my indignation more aroused
than when i beheld a sturdy ruffian aim a desperate blow at her head
with his rattle which in all probability had it taken the intended
effect would have sent her in search that peace in the other world
 which she was experiencing so little in this it was not possible
for me to stand by an idle spectator the destruction a female
who appeared to have no defender whatever might be the nature the
offence alleged or committed i therefore warded off the blow with my
left arm and with my right gave him a wellplanted blow on the conk
which sent him piping into the kennel in a moment i was surrounded and
charged with a violent assault upon the charley and interfering with
the guardians the night in the execution their duty a complete
diversion took place from the original object their fury and in the
bustle to secure me the unfortunate girl made her escape where to or
how heaven

only knows upon finding this i made no resistance but marched
boldly along with the scouts to st martin's watchhouse where we
arrived just as a hackney coach drew up to the door
take her in d n her eyes she shall stump up the rubbish 
before i leave her or give me the address her flash covey 
and so here goes by this time we had entered the watchhouse where
i perceived the awful representative justice seated in an arm chair
with a good blazing fire smoking his pipe in consequential ease
a crowd charleys with broken lanterns broken heads and other
symptoms a row together with several casual spectators had gained
admittance when jarvis entered declaring by g he wouldn't be
choused by any wh re or cull in christendom and he would make em
come down pretty handsomely or he'd know the reason why and so please
your worship sir then turning round hallo said he sam what's
become that there woman eh what you've been playing booty eh and
let her escape the man to whom this was intended to be addressed did
not appear to be present as no reply was made however the case was
briefly explained
but by g i won't put any thing in sam's vay again cried
jarvey for my own part as i knew nothing the occurrences
adverted to i was as much in the dark as if i had gone home without
interruption the representations the charleys proved decisive
against me in vain i urged the cause humanity and the necessity
i felt protecting a defenceless female from the violence 
accumulating numbers and that i had done no more than every man ought
to have done upon such an occasion old puff and swill the lord
 the night declared that i must have acted with malice
aforethought that i was a pal in the concern and that i had been
instrumental in the design effecting a rescue and after a very
short deliberation he concluded that i must be a notorious rascal and
desired me to make up my mind to remain with him for the remainder 
the night not relishing this i proposed to send for bail assuring him

find money

attendance in the morning but was informed it could not be
accepted as it was clearly made out against me that i had committed
a violent breach the peace and nothing at that time could be
produced that would prove satisfactory under these circumstances and
partly induced by a desire to avoid being troublesome in other quarters
i submitted to a restraint which it appeared i could not very well
avoid and taking my seat in an armchair by the fireside i soon fell
fast asleep from which i was only aroused by the occasional entrances
and exits the guardians until between four and five o'clock when
a sort general muster the charleys took place and each one
depositing his nightly paraphernalia proceeded to his own habitation
finding the liberation others from their duties would not have the
effect emancipating me from my confinement which was likely to
be prolonged to eleven or perhaps twelve o'clock i began to feel
my situation as a truly uncomfortable one when i was informed by the
watchhouse keeper who resides upon the spot that he was going to
turn in that there was fire enough to last till his wife turn'd
out which would be about six o'clock and as i had the appearance a
gentleman if there was any thing i wanted she would endeavour to make
herself useful in obtaining it but lord said he there is no such
thing as believing any body nowadays there was such sets out and
such manoeuvring that nobody knew nothing nobody
i am obliged to you my friend said i for this piece 
information and in order that you may understand something the
person you are speaking to beyond the mere exterior view here is
halfacrown for your communication
why sir said he laying on at the same moment a shovel coals
this here makes out what i said don't you see said i that are
gentleman is a gentleman every inch him says i as don't want
nothing at all no more nor what is right and if so be as how he's got
himself in a bit a hobble i knows very well as how he's got
the tip in his pocket and doesn't want for spirit to pull it
out perhaps you might like some breakfast sir
 turn in going to bed this is a term most in use among
seafaring men
 tip is synonymous with blunt and means money
why yes said i for i began to feel a little inclined that way
o my wife sir said he will do all you want when she rouses
herself
i suppose continued i you frequently have occasion to accommodate
persons in similar situations
lord bless you yes sir and a strange set rum customers we have
too sometimes why it was but a few nights ago we had em stowed here
as thick as three in a bed we had em all upon the hop you never
see'd such fun in all your life and this here place was as full 
curiosities as peacock's at exeter change or barleyfair show em up
here all alive alive o
indeed said i feeling a little inquisitive on the subject and how
did this happen
why it was a romish piece business altogether there was a large
party dancing fashionables all met together for a little jig in st
martin's lane and a very pretty medley there was them the fiddlers
wagged their elbows and the lads and lasses their trotters till about
one o'clock when just as they were in the midst a quadrille in
burst the officers and quickly changed the tune the appearance 
these gentlemen had an instantaneous effect upon all parties present
the cause their visit was explained and the whole squad taken into
custody to give an account themselves and was brought here in
hackneycoaches the delicate miss and her assiduous partner who a
short time before had been all spirits and animation were now sunk in
gloomy reflections upon the awkwardness their situation and many 
our inhabitants would have fainted when they were informed they would
have to appear before the magistrate in the morning but for the
welltimed introduction a little drap the cratur which an irish
lady axed me to fetch for her but the best the fun was that in the
group we had a lord and a parson for the dignity the one and the
honour the other they were admitted to bail lord have mercy upon
us said the parson amen said the lord and this had the desired
effect upon the constable the night for he let them off on the sly
you understand but my eyes what work there was in the morning sixteen
harvey full live lumber
 hop a dance
were taken to bowstreet in a nice pickle you may be sure
dancingpumps and silkstockings after setting in the watchhouse all
night and surrounded by lots people that hooted and howled as the
procession passed along in good style they were safely landed at the
brown bear from which they were handed over in groups to be examined
by the magistrate when the men were discharged upon giving satisfactory
accounts and the women after some questions being put to them you see
all this took place because they were dancing in an unlicensed room it
was altogether a laughable setout as ever you see'd the dandy and
the dandyzettes the exquisite the shorten the ladies maid and the
prentice boys my lord and his reverence mingled up higgledypiggledy
pigs in the straw with bowstreet officers runners and
watchmen ladies squalling and fainting men swearing and almost
fighting it would have been a pleasure to have kick'd up a row that
night a purpose to get admission you would have been highly amused
i'll assure you good morning sir and thus saying he turned the lock
upon me and left me to my meditations in about a couple hours
the old woman made her appearance and prepared me some coffee and at
eleven o'clock came the constable the night to accompany me before
the magistrate
aware that the circumstances were rather against me and that i had no
right to interfere in other persons business or quarrels i consulted
him upon the best mode making up the matter for although i had
really done no more than becomes a man in protecting a female i had
certainly infringed upon the law in effecting the escape a person in
custody and consequently was liable to the penalty or penalties in such
cases made and provided on our arrival at the brown bear i was met
by a genteellooking man who delivered me a letter and immediately
disappeared upon breaking the seal i found its contents as follows
dear sir although unknown to me i have learned enough your
character to pronounce you a trump a prime cock and nothing but a good
one i am detained by john doe and richard roe with their d d fieri
facias or i should be with you however i trust you will excuse the
liberty i take in requesting you will make use the enclosed for the
purpose shaking yourself out the hands the scouts and
their pals we shall have some opportunities meeting when i will
explain in the mean time believe me i am
your's truly
tom
with this advice so consonant with my own opinion i immediately
complied and having satisfied the brokenheaded charley and paid all
expences incurred i was induced to walk into the office merely to give
a look around me when by a lucky chance i saw you enter and thus you
have a full true and particular account the peregrinations your
humble servant
listening with close attention to this narrative sparkle's all other
subjects had escaped observation till they found themselves in the
strand
whither are we bound inquired sparkle
on a voyage discoveries replied dashall and we just wanted you
to act as pilot
what place is this inquired bob
that continued sparkle is somersethouse it is a fine old
building it stands on the banks the thames raised on piers and
arches and is now appropriated to various public offices and houses
belonging to the various offices the government
the terrace which lies on the river is very fine and may be well
viewed from waterloo bridge the front in the strand you perceive
has a noble aspect being composed a rustic basement supporting a
corinthian order columns crowned with an attic in the centre and at
the extremities with a balustrade the south front which looks into the
court is very elegant in its composition
the basement consists nine large arches and three in the centre
open forming the principal entrance and three at each filled with
windows the doric order are adorned with pilasters entablatures
and pediments on the keystones the nine arches are carved in alto
relievo nine colossal masks representing the ocean and the eight main
rivers england viz thames humber mersey dee medway tweed
tyne and severn with appropriate emblems to denote their various
characters
over the basement the corinthian order consists ten columns upon
pedestals having their regular entablature it comprehends two
floors and the attic in the centre the front extends over three
intercolomniations and is divided into three parts by four colossal
statues placed on the columns the order it terminates with a
group consisting the arms the british empire supported on one
side by the genius england and by fame sounding the trumpet on the
other these three open arches in the front form the principal entrance
to the whole the structure and lead to an elegant vestibule
decorated with doric columns
the terrace which fronts the thames is spacious and commands a
beautiful view part the river including blacksmiths waterloo
and westminster bridges it is reared on a grand rustic basement
having thirtytwo spacious arches the arcade thus formed is judiciously
relieved by projections ornamented with rusticated columns and the
effect the whole the terrace from the water is truly grand and
noble there is however at present no admission for the public toit
but in all probability it will be open to all when the edifice is
completed which would form one the finest promenades in the world
and prove to be one the first luxuries the metropolis
that statue in the centre is a representation our late king george
the third with the thames at his feet pouring wealth and plenty from
a large cornucopia it is executed by bacon and has his characteristic
cast expression it is in a most ludicrous situation being placed
behind and on the brink a deep area
in the vestibule are the rooms the royal society the society 
antiquarians and the royal academy arts all in a very grand and
beautiful style over the door the royal academy is a bust michael
angelo and over the door leading to the royal society and society 
antiquarians you will find the bust sir isaac newton
the governmentoffices to which this building is devoted are objects
 great astonishment to strangers being at once commodious and
elegant and worthy the wealth the nation to which they belong the
hall the navy office is a fine room with two fronts one facing the
terrace and river and the other facing the court on the right is the
stampoffice it consists a multitude apartments the room in
which the stamping is executed is very interesting to the curious on
the left you see the payoffice the navy
the principal thing to attract notice in this edifice is the
solidity and completeness the workmanship in the masonry and indeed
in every other part
after taking a rather prolonged view this elegant edifice they again
sallied forth into the strand mingling with all the noise and bustle
 a crowded street where by turns were to be discovered rustling each
other parsons lawyers apothecaries projectors excisemen organists
picturesellers bear and monkeyleaders fiddlers and bailiffs the
barber and the chimneysweeper were however always observed to be
careful in avoiding the touch each other as if contamination must bethe
inevitable consequence
my dear fellow exclaimed a tall and welldressed person who dragged
the honourable tom dashall on one side you are the very person i
wanted i'm very glad to see you in town again but i have not a moment
to spare the bloodhounds are in pursuit this term will be ended
in two days then comes the long vacation liberty without hiring
a horse you understand was devilishly afraid being nabb'd just
now should have been dished if i had lend me five shillings come
make haste
five shillings diddler when am i to be paid you remember when i
grow rich was the reply
know yes i know all about it but no matter i'm not going to settle
accounts just now so don't detain me i hate debtor and creditor
fine sport tomorrow eh shall be at the ring in cog take no
notice disguised as a quaker obadiah lankloaks d d large beaver
hat and hide my physog lend me what silver you have and be quick
about it for i can't stay thank you you're a d a good fellow
tom a trump shall now pop into a hack and drive into another
county thank ye good day by by
during this harangue while tost was counting his silver the ingenious
mr diddler seized all he had and whipping it speedily into his pocket
in a few minutes was out his sight
sparkle observing dashall looking earnestly after diddler approached
and giving him a lusty slap on the shoulder ha ha ha exclaimed he
what are you done again
i suppose so said dashall confound the fellow he is always
borrowing i never met him in my life but he had some immediate
necessity or other to require a loan a little temporary supply as he
calls it
i wonder said sparkle that you are so ready to lend after such
frequent experience how much does he owe you
heaven only knows continued tom for i do not keep account against
him i must even trust to his honour so it is useless to stand here
losing our time come let us forward
with all my heart said sparkle and with permission i propose a
visit to the bonassus a peep at st paul's and a chop at dolly's
this proposition being highly approved they continued their
walk along the strand towards temple bar and in a few minutes were
attracted by the appearance men dressed in the garb the yeomen 
the guards who appeared active in the distribution handbills and
surrounded a house on the front which appeared a long string high
and distinguished names as patrons and patronesses the celebrated
animal called the bonassus crossing the road in their approach to
the door tallyhoho could not help admiring the simple elegance a
shopfront belonging to a grocer whose name is peck
very handsome and tasty indeed replied sparkle that combination 
marble and brass has a light and elegant effect it has no appearance 
being laboured at the inhabitant the house i believe is a foreigner
i think an italian but london boasts some the most elegant shops
in the world and by this time they entered the opposite house
chapter 
in london my life is a ring delight
in frolics i keep up the day and the night
i snooze at the hummums till twelve perhaps later
i rattle the bell and i roar up the waiter
your honour says he and he makes me a leg
he brings me my tea but i swallow an egg
for tea in a morning's a slop i renounce
so i down with a glass good right cherrybounce
with swearing tearing ranting jaunting slashing
smashing smacking cracking rumbling tumbling
laughing quaffing smoking joking swaggering
staggering
so thoughtless so knowing so green and so mellow
this this is the life a frolicsome fellow
upon entering the house and depositing their shilling each to
view this newly discovered animal from the appalachian mountains 
america and being supplied with immense long bills descriptive his
form and powers come along said sparkle let us have a look at the
most wonderful production nature only seventeen months old five
feet ten inches high and one the most fashionable fellows in the
metropolis
it should seem so said tallyhoho by the long list friends and
visitors that are detailed in the commencement the bill fare
perhaps said tom there are more bon asses than one
very likely continued sparkle but let me tell you the allusion in
this case does not apply for this animal has nothing the donkey
about him and makes no noise as you will infer from the following
lines in the bill
as the bonassus does not roar
his fame is widely known
for no dumb animal before
has made such noise in town
at this moment the barking a dog assailed their ears and
suspended the conversation passing onward to the den the bonassus
they found a darkfeatured gentleman middling stature with his hair
whiskers and ears so whitened with powder as to form a complete
contrast with his complexion and a black silk handkerchief which he wore
round his neck holding a large browncoloured dog by the collar in
order to prevent annoyance to the visitors
d n the dog exclaimed he although he is the best tempered
creature in the world he don't seem to like the appearance the
bonassus and espying sparkle ha my dear fellow how are you i
have not seen you for a long while
why sir d n ll i am happy to say i never was better in my
life allow me to introduce you to my two friends the hon mr dashall
and robert tallyhoho sir d n ll harlequin
the mutual accompaniments such an introduction having passed among
them the knight who was upon the moment departure as they entered
expressed his approbation the animal he had been viewing and
lugging his puppy by one hand and his cudgel in the other wished them
a good morning
there is an eccentric man title continued sparkle
i should judge said bob there was a considerable portion 
eccentricity about him by his appearance is he a baronet
a baronet replied sparkle no no he is no other than a quack
doctor 
 all the subjects that afford opportunities for the
satiric pen in the metropolis perhaps there is none more
abundant or prolific than that quackery dr johnson
observes that cheats can seldom stand long against
laughter but if a judgment is really to be formed from
existing facts it may be supposed that times are so
materially changed since the residence that able writer
in this sublunary sphere that the reverse the position
may with greater propriety be asserted for such is the
prevailing practice the present day that according to
the opinion thousands there is nothing to be done
without a vast deal more profession and pretence than
actual power and he who is the best able to bear laughing
at is the most likely to realize the hopes he entertains 
obtaining celebrity and having his labours crowned with
success nothing can be more evident than this in the
medical profession though there are successful quacks 
all kinds and in all situations to be found in london
this may truly be called the age quackery from the
abundance impostors every kind that prey upon society
and such as cannot or will not think for themselves ought
to be guarded in a publication this nature against the
fraudulent acts those persons who make it their business
and profit to deteriorate the health morals and amusements
 the public but in the present instance we are speaking
 the medical quack only than which perhaps there is none
more remarkable
the race bosses brodrums solomon perkins claimants
c is filled by others equal notoriety and no doubt 
equal utility the cerfs the curries the laments the
ruspinis the coopers and monroe are all equally entitled
to public approbation particularly if we may credit the
letters from the various persons who authenticate the
miraculous cures they have performed in the most inveterate
we hail almost said the most impossible cases if those
persons are really in existence and who can doubt it they
certainly have occasion to be thankful for their escapes
and we congratulate them for in our estimation quack
doctors seem to consider the human frame merely as a subject
for experiments which if successful will secure the
reputation the practitioner the acquisition fame and
fortune is in the estimation these philosophers cheaply
purchased by sacrificing the lives a few the vulgar
to whom they prescribe gratis and the slavish obedience 
some patients to the doctor is really astonishing it is
said that a convalescent at bath wrote to his physician in
london to know whether he might eat sauce with his pork
but we have not been able to discover whether he expected an
answer gratis that would perhaps have been an experiment
not altogether grateful to the doctor's feelings
the practice advertising and billing the town has become
so common that a man scarcely opens a coalshed or a
potatoesstall without giving due notice it in the
newspapers and distributing handbills and frequently with
great success but our doctors who make no show their
commodities have no mode making themselves known without
it hence the quantity bills thrust into the hand the
passenger through the streets london which divulge the
almost incredible performances their publishers a highsounding
name such as the chevalier de diamant the
chevalier de rushing or the medical board well bored behind
and before are perhaps more necessary with a few paper
puffs as palpable hits my lord than either skill or
practice to obtain notice and secure fame
the chevalier de claimant who was originally a boxmaker
and a man genius considering boxmaking a plebeian
occupation was for deducing a logical position not exactly
perhaps by fair argument but at all events through the
teeth and was determined although he could not like dr
n mend the apology his friends at least to give
them an opportunity for plenty jawwork with this
laudable object in view he obtained a patent for making
artificial teeth mineral paste and in his advertisements
condescended not to prove their utility as substitutes for
the real teeth when decayed or wanting this was beneath
his notice and would have been a piece mere plebeian
quackery unworthy his great genius but absolutely
assured the world that his mineral teeth were infinitely
superior to any production nature both for mastication
and beauty how this was relished we know not but he
declared and he certainly ought to know that none but
silly and timid persons would hesitate for one moment to
have their teeth drawn and substitute his minerals and it
is wonderful to relate that although his charges were
enormous and the operation as may be supposed not the
most pleasant yet people could not resist the ingenious
chevalier's fascinating and drawing puffs in consequence 
which he soon became possessed a large surplus 
capital with which he determined to speculate in the funds
for this purpose he employed old tom bish the stockbroker
to purchase stock for the amount but owing to a sudden
fluctuation in the market a considerable depreciation took
place between the time purchase and that payment a
circumstance which made the chevalier grin and show his
teeth determining however not to become a victim to the
fangs bulls and bears but rather to dive like a duck he
declared the bargain was not legal and that he would not be
bound by it bish upon this occasion proved a hardmouthed
customer to the man teeth and was not a quiet subject to
be drawn but brought an action against the mineral monger
and recovered the debt tom's counsel in stating the case
observed that the defendant would find the law could bite
sharper aud hold tighter than any teeth he could make and
so it turned out
the chevalier de r sp ni is another character who has cut
no small figure in this line but has recently made his
appearance in the gazette not exactly on so happy an
occasion as such a circumstance would be to his brother
chip dr d n ll now we suppose sir francis though
perhaps equally entitled to the honour knighthood the
chevalier has for some years looked royalty in the face by
residing opposite carlton house and taken every precaution
to let the public know that such an important public
character was there to be found by displaying his name as
conspicuously as possible on brass plates c so that the
visitors to carlton house could hardly fail to notice him as
the second greatest character that great neighbourhood
but what could induce so great a man to sport his figure in
the gazette is as unaccountable as the means by which he
obtained such happy celebrity had it occurred immediately
after the war it might have been concluded without much
stretch imagination that the chevalier who prides
himself on his intimacy with all the great men the day
had through the friendship the duke wellington made
a contract for the teeth and jawbones all who fell at
the battle waterloo and that by bringing to market so
great a stock at one time the article had fallen in value
and left the speculating chevalier so great a loser as to
cause his bankruptcy whether such is the real cause or not
it is difficult to ascertain what could induce the chevalier
to descend from his dealings with the head to dabble with
lower commodities
among other modes obtaining notoriety usually resorted
to by empiric the chevalier used to job a very genteel
carriage and pair but his management was so excellent that
the expenses his equipage were very trifling for as it
was not intended to run but merely to stand at the door
like a barker at a broker's shop or a directionpost he
had the loan on very moderate terms the jobmaster taking
into account that the wind the cattle was not likely to
be injured or the wheels rattled to pieces by velocity or
smashed by any violent concussion
the chevalier had a son who unfortunately was not endowed
by nature with so much ambition or information as his
father for frequently when the carriage has been standing
at the door he has been seen drinking gin most cordially
with coaches without once thinking the evils example
or recollecting that he was one the family papa used to
be very angry on these occasions because as he said it
was letting people know that coaches was only hired as job
and not as a family domestic
for the great benefit and advantage the community
medical boards have recently been announced in various parts
 the metropolis where according to the assertions the
principals in their advertisements every disease incident
to human nature is treated by men skilful practice and
among these truly useful establishments those drs
cooper munro and co charlotte house blacksmiths and
woodstockhouse oxfordroad are not the least conspicuous
who these worthies are it is perhaps difficult to
ascertain one thing however is certain that sir
f s c e d n ll med is announced as treasurer
therefore there can be no doubt but that all is fair aboveboard
for
brutus is an honourable man
so are they all all honourable men
and where so much skill derived from experience is
exercised it cannot be doubted but great and important
benefits may result to a liberal and enlightened people 
the establishment itself we are informed by a friend that
having occasion to call on the treasurer upon some
business the door was opened by a coppercoloured servant
a goodlooking young indian not a fuscus hydaspes but a
serving man good appearance who ushered him up stairs
and introduced him to the front room on the first floor
where all was quackery bronze and brass an electrical
machine images pictures and diplomas framed and glazed
and a table covered with books and papers in a short time
a person very imposing appearance entered the room with
his hair profusely powdered and his person from his chin
to his toes enveloped in a sort plaid roquelaure who
apologizing for the absence the doctor began to assure
him his being in the entire confidence the board and
in all probability would have proceeded to the operation 
feeling the pulse in a very short time had not the visitor
discovered in the features this disciple aesculapius a
person he had known in former times why good god
cried he is that you what have you done with the magiclantern
and the lecture on heads am i right or am i in
fairyland calling him by his name it was in vain to
hesitate it was impossible to escape the discovery was
complete it was plain however that the dealer in magical
delusions had not altogether given up the art 
legerdemain which perhaps he finds the most profitable 
the two
 the worthy knight himself and perhaps the coopers and
munro have been consumed by the electrical fluid their
own board much might be said he is the inventor a lifepreserver
with which it may be fairly presumed he has
effected valuable services to his country by the
preservation royalty as a proof deserving the honour
he has obtained he is patriotic and independent masonic
and benevolent a great admirer fancy horses and fancy
ladies a curer incurables and has recently published
one the most extraordinary memoirs that has ever been
laid before the public embellished with two portraits
which the two is most interesting must be left to the
discrimination those who view them it must however be
acknowledged that after reading the following extract
ingratitude is not yet eradicated from our nature since
notwithstanding he has obtained the dignified appellation 
sir francis the gazette says that in future no improper
person shall be admitted to the honour knighthood inconsequence
 two surreptitious presentations lately the
one an med the other frc surgeons particularly if it
were possible that this gentleman may be one the persons
alluded to for what says the memoir
the utility sir francis's invention being thus fully
established and its ingenuity universally admired it
excited the interest the first characters among the
nobility and an introduction to court was repeatedly
offered to sir francis on this account after a previous
communication with one the royal family and also with
the secretary state on the th june last he had the
honour being presented to his majesty who justly
appreciating the merit the discovery was pleased to
confer upon him the honour knighthood
thus it is pleasing in the distribution honours by the
hand the sovereign to mark where they are conferred on
real merit this is the true intention their origin but
it has been too often departed from and they have been
given where no other title existed than being the friend 
those who had influence to gain the royal ear from the
above statement it will be seen this honour was conferred
on sir francis by his majesty for an invention which has
saved since its discovery the lives many hundreds and
which may be considered as having given the original idea to
the similar inventions that have been attempted since that
time its utility and importance we have also seen
acknowledged and rewarded by the two leading societies in
this country and perhaps in europe viz the royal humane
and the society arts the sovereign therefore was only
recognizing merit which had been previously established and
the honour knighthood to the credit the individual
was conferred by his majesty in the most liberal and
handsome manner without any other influence being used by
sir francis than simply preferring the claim
thus the subject knighthood is to be nursed and as the
doctor and the nurse are generally to be recognized
together no one can read this part the memoir without
exclaiming well done nussey but why not gazetted after
this liberal and handsome manner being rewarded or why
an allusion to two surreptitious presentations the names 
which two persons so pointedly omitted cannot well be
misunderstood this is but doing things by halves though no
such an observation can be applied to the proceedings 
charlottehouse where cooper munro and co being well
explained means two or three persons viz a black a white
man and a mahoganycoloured knight a barber by trade and
a skinner by company a dealer in mercurial a puff by
practice and an advertiser well versed in all the arts 
his prototype a practitioner in panegyric the puff direct
the puff preliminary the puff collateral the puff
collusive and the puff oblique or puff by implication
whether this will apply to sir charles this or not is
perhaps not so easy to ascertain but as birds a feather
like to flock together so these medical knights in
misfortune deserve to be noticed in the same column
although the one is said to be a shaver and the other a
quaker it seems they have both been moved by the same
spirit and both follow a good way off the profession 
medicine
among the various improvements these improving times for
we are still improving notwithstanding complaint a learned
little devil inflated with gas has suggested a plan for
the establishment a medical assuranceoffice where
person and property might be insured at so much per annum
and the advantages to be derived from such an institution
would be that instead the insurance increasing with
years it would grow less and less how many thousand
grateful patients would it relieve annually but we fear it
would be a daily source sorrow to these knightly
medical and would by them be considered a devilish hard
case
but hush here is other company and i will give you an account him
as we go along
they now attended the keeper who explained the age height weight
species size power and propensities the animal and then departed
on their road towards temple bar on passing through which they were
overtaken again by sir francis in a gig drawn by a duncoloured
horse with his puppy between his legs and a servant by his side and
immediately renewed the previous conversation
there he goes again said sparkle and a rare fellow he is too
i should think so said bob he must have quacked to some good
purpose to obtain the honour knighthood
not positively that continued sparkle for to obtain and to
deserve are not synonymous and if report say true there is not much
honour attached to his obtaining it
in the modesty fearful duty
i read as much as from the rattling tongue
 saucy and audacious eloquence
love therefore and tonguetied simplicity
at least speak most to my capacity
and according to my humble conception he who talks much about himself
or pays others to talk or write about him is generally most likely to
be least deserving public patronage for if a man possesses real and
evident abilities in any line profession the public will not belong
in making a discovery its existence and the bounty as is most
usually the case would quickly follow upon the heels approbation
but many a meritorious man in the metropolis is pining away his
miserable existence too proud to beg and too honest to steal while
others with scarcely more brains than a sparrow by persevering ina
determination to leave no stone unturned to make themselves appear
ridiculous as a first step to popularity and having once excited
attention even though it is merely to be laughed at by the thinking
part mankind he finds it no great difficulty to draw the money out
 their pockets while their eyes are riveted on a contemplation his
person or conduct and there are not wanting instances effrontery
that have elevated men little or no capacity to dignified situations
if report say true the present secretary the admiralty who is
admirable for his poetry also was originally a hairdresser residing
somewhere in blackfriar's or westminsterroad but then you must
recollect he was a man who knew it was useless to lose a single
opportunity and probably such has been the case with sir daniel
harlequin who from keeping a small shop in tapping making a blaze
upon the water about his lifepreserver marrying a wife with a red
face and a full pocket retired to a small cottage at mile and
afterwards establishing a medical board has got himself dubbed a
knight to be sure he has had a deal puffing and blowing work to get
through in his progress which probably accounts for his black looks
not a little increased by the quantity powder he wears but what have
we here finding the bustle the streets considerably increased after
passing temple bar
some political bookseller or other in all probability said
tom i'll step forward and see and in passing through the numerous
body persons that crowded on every side the whole party was
separated bob who had hung a little back while his two friends rushed
forward was lingering near the corner the temple he was beckoned by
a man across the way to whom he immediately went
do you happen to want a piece fine india silk handkerchiefs sir
i have some in my pocket that i can recommend and sell cheap for money
must be had but only keep it to yourself because they are smuggled
goods the best quality and richest pattern during this opening
speech he was endeavouring to draw tallyhoho under the archway 
bellyard when sparkle espying him ran across to him and taking him
by the arm come along said he and if you don't take yourself off
instantly i'll put you in custody shaking his stick at the other
all this was like hebrew to bob who for his part really conceived the
poor fellow as he termed him might be in want money and compelled
to dispose his article for subsistence
ha ha ha cried sparkle i see you know nothing about them these
are the locusts the town at this moment they were joined by the
hon tom dashall
egad continued sparkle i just saved your cousin from being
trepanned and sent for a soldier
tallyhoho appeared all amazement
what cried tom in the wars venus then i suppose i know he has a
fancy for astronomy and probably he was desirous taking a peep into
shirelane where he might easily find the sun moon and seven stars
ha ha ha replied sparkle not exactly so but i rescued him from
the hands a buffer who would
 buffers miscalled duffers persons who adopt a species 
swindling which is rather difficult detection though it
is daily practised in london the term buffer takes its
derivation from a custom which at one time prevailed 
carrying bandanas garnets french stockings and silk 
various kinds next the shirts the sellers so that upon
making a sale they were obliged to undress in order to come
at the goods or in other words to strip to the skin or
buff it by which means they obtained the title buffers
this trade if it may be so termed is carried on in a
genteel manner the parties go about from house to house
and attend publichouses inns and fairs pretending to
sell smuggled goods such as those already mentioned and by
offering their goods for sale they are enabled by practice
to discover the proper objects for their arts
buffers or duffers who are not rogues in the strict sense
 the word only offer to sell their goods to the best
advantage and by this means evade the detection the
police but are equally subversive or destructive common
honesty under a cloak or disguise for if they can persuade
any person that the article offered is actually better or
cheaper than any other person's they are doing no more than
every tradesman does but then as they pay no rent or taxes
to the state the principal objection to them lies in the
mode operation and an overstrained recommendation 
their goods which are always according to their account
 the most superior quality and they have a peculiar
facility discovering the novice or the silly to whom
walking up with a serious countenance and interesting air
they broach the pleasing intelligence that they have on
sale an excellent article well worth their attention giving
a caution at the same time that honour and secrecy must be
implicitly observed or it may lead to unpleasantness to
both parties by these means persons from the country are
frequently enticed into publichouses to look at their
goods and if they do not succeed in one way they are
almost sure in another by having an accomplice who will
not fail to praise the articles for sale and propose some
gambling scheme by which the party is plundered his
money by passing forged banknotes base silver or copper
in the course their dealings
doubtless have fleeced him in good style if he could only have
induced him to attend to his story
the mob you see collected there said the hon tom dashalll is
attracted by two circumstances money's new coronation crop just
launched and a broken image a highlander at the door a
snuffshop each them truly important and interesting course the
elevation one man and the destruction another the poor scotchman
seems dreadfully bruised and i suppose is now under the doctor's hands
for he has two or three plasters on his face
yes continued sparkle he has been out on a spree had a bit a
turnup and been knock'd down
upon hearing this conversation tallyhoho could not help inquiring into
the particulars
why the facts are simply as follows continued
 spree a bit fun or a frolicsome lark
sparkle in london as you perceive tradesmen are in the habit
 exhibiting signs the business or profession in which they are
engaged the pawnbroker decorates his door with three gold balls the
barber in some places though it is a practice almost out date
hangs out a long pole the goldbeater an arm with a hammer in the
act striking the chemist a head glauber or aesculapius the
tobacconist a roll tobacco and late it has become customary
for these venders pulverised atoms called snuff to station a wooden
figure a highlander in the act taking a pinch hardham's or
highdried as a sort inviting introduction to their counters and
a few nights back a scotchman returning from his enjoyments at a
neighbouring tavern stopped to have a little friendly chat with this
gentleman's highlander and by some means or other i suppose a quarrel
ensued upon which the animated young scotchman took advantage his
countryman floored him broke both his arms and otherwise did him
considerable bodily injury the effects which are still visible
and johnny bull who is fond a little gapeseed is endeavouring to
console him under his sufferings
very kind him indeed replied bob
at any rate said tom the tobacconist will have occasion to be
grateful to the highlanders for some portion his popularity
 it is matter astonishment to some but not less true
that many tradesmen in the metropolis have to ascribe both
fame and fortune to adventitious circumstances it is said
that hardham fleet street had to thank the celebrated
comedian foote who in one his popular characters
introducing his snuffbox offered a pinch to the person he
was in conversation with on the stage who spoke well it
and inquired where he obtained it why at hardham's to
be sure and to this apparently trifling circumstance
hardham was indebted for his fortune
the importance a highlander to a snuffshop will appear
by a perusal the following fact
a very respectable young man a clerk in the office an
eminent solicitor was recently brought before mr alderman
atkins upon the charge being disorderly the prisoner
it seemed on his return home from a social party where he
had been sacrificing rather too freely to the jolly god was
struck with the appearance a showy wooden figure a
highlander at the door mr micklan's snuffshop no 
fleet street the young attorney who is himself a
scotchman must needs claim acquaintance with his
countryman he chucked him familiarly under the chin called
him a very pretty fellow and in the vehemence his
affection embraced him with so much violence as to force
him from his station mr micklan ran to the assistance 
his servant and in the scuffle the unfortunate highlander
had both his arms dislocated the frill that adorned his
neck damaged besides other personal injuries which his
living countryman not being in the humour to atone for mr
mickle gave him in charge to the watchman before the
magistrate in the morning the young man appeared heartily
sick his folly and perfectly willing to make every
reparation but complained the excessive demand which he
stated to be no less than thirteen guineas mr micklan
produced the remains the unfortunate highlander who
excited a compound fracture both arms with a mutilation
 three or four fingers and such other bodily wounds as
to render his perfect recovery so as to resume his
functions at mr micklan's door altogether hopeless the
highlander the complainant stated cost him thirteen
guineas and was entirely new the sum might seem large for
the young gentleman to pay for such a frolic but it would
not compensate him for the injury he should sustain by the
absence the figure for however strange it might appear
he did not hesitate to say that without it he should not
have more than half his business since he had stationed it
at his door he had taken on an average thirty shillings a
day more than he had done previous to exhibiting his
attractions
there being no proof a breach the peace mr alderman
atkins advised the gentleman to settle the matter upon the
best terms he could they withdrew together and on their
return the echo appears ignorant and
unsuspicious
 lusty drunk
 toddle to toddle is to walk slowly either from
infirmity or choice come let us toddle is a very
familiar phrase signifying let us be going
desirous seeing an to this bit gig come along said
sparkle they'll all be in prime twig presently and we shall have some
fun
i'm the boy for a bit a bobbery
nabbing a lantern or milling a pane
a jolly good lark is not murder or robbery
let us be ready and nimble
hark said he there's a fiddlescraper in the house here goes and
immediately they entered
they had no occasion to repent their movements for in one corner
 the taproom sat billy waters a wellknown character about town
a black man with a wooden leg was fiddling to a slaughterman from
fleetmarket in wooden shoes who deck'd with all the paraphernalia 
his occupation a greasy jacket and nightcap an apron besmeared with
mud blood and grease nearly an inch thick and a leathern girdle
from which was suspended a case to hold his knives and his sleeves
tuck'd up as if he had but just left the slaughterhouse was dancing in
the centre to the infinite amusement the company which consisted 
an old woman with periwinkles and crabs for sale in a basket a porter
with his knot upon the table a fustian with his broadflapped hat and
his bell by his side an irish hodman and two poor girls who appeared
to be greatly taken with the black fiddler whose head was decorated
with an oilskinned cock'd hat and a profusion many coloured
feathers on the other side the room sat a young man 
shabbygenteel appearance reading the newspaper with close attention
and purring forth volumes smoke limping billy and mother mapps were
immediately known and room was made for their accommodation while the
fiddler's elbow and the slaughterman's wooden shoes were kept in motion
max l was the order the day and the sluice in good
request mother mapps was made easy by being informed the streetkeeper
had her valuables in charge which limping billy promised he would
redeem bring us a
 max a very common term for gin
 sluice a ginshop or publichouse so denominated from
the lower orders society sluicing their throats as it
were with gin and probably derived from the old song
entitled the christening little joey formerly sung
by jemmy dodd facetious memory
and when they had sluiced their gobs
with striving to excel wit
the lads began to hang their nobs
and lip their grows the velvets
nobs heads
 grows originally a dutch word meaning wives or girls
velvet the tongue
noggin white tape and fill me a pipe said he d n
my eyes i knowe as how it you'd be all right enough i never gets in
no rows whatever without getting myself out again come ould chap
vet your vistle and tip it us rum go it my kiddy that are's just vat
i likes 
vat's the reason i an't to have a pipe said mother mapps
lord bless your heart said the donkeydriver if i did'nt forget
you never trust me here landlord a pipe for this here lady
which way did the bull run said the irishman
bl st me if i know replied limping billy for i was a
looking out for my own ass let's have the sprig shelalah ould
blackamoor come tune up
the old woman being supplied with a pipe and the fiddler having joined
his nerves with a glass blue ruin to it they went some singing
some whistling and others drumming with their hands upon the table
while tom bob and sparkle taking a seat at the other side 
the room ordered a glass brandy and water each and enjoyed the
merriment the scene before them perhaps more than those actually
engaged in it bob was alive to every movement and every character for
it was new and truly interesting and kept growing more so for in a
few minutes limping billy and mother mapps joined the slaughterman in
the dance when nothing could be more grotesque and amusing their pipes
in their mouths clapping hands and snapping fingers formed a
curious accompaniment to the squeaking the fiddle the broad grin 
the dustman and the preposterous laugh the
 white tape also a common term for gin particularly among
the ladies
 ould chap or ould boy familiar terms address among
flash lads being a sort contraction old acquaintance
or old friend
 blue ruin gin
irishman at the feelers in the centre heightened the picture more
gin more music and more tobacco soon ad a visible effect upon the
party and reeling became unavoidable the young man reading the paper
found it impossible to understand what he was perusing and having
finished his pipe and his pint made his exit appearing to have no
relish for the entertainment and perhaps heartily cursing both the
cause and the effect still however the party was not reduced in
number for as one went out another came in
this new customer was a younglooking man bearing a large board on a
high pole announcing the residence a bugdestroyer in the strand
his appearance was grotesque in the extreme and could only be equalled
by the eccentricities his manners and conversation he was dressed
in a brown coat close buttoned over which he had a red camlet or stuff
stout apparently the offcast some theatrical performer but with
a determination to appear fashionable for
folks might as well be dead nay buried too
as not to dress and act as others do
he wore mustachios a pair green spectacles and his whole figure was
surmounted with a furcap taking a seat directly opposite our party
at the same table bring me a pint said he and then deliberately
searching his pockets he produced a short pipe and some tobacco with
which he filled it you see said he i am obliged to smoke according
to the doctor's orders for an asthma so i always smokes three pipes a
day that's my allowance but i can eat more than any man in the room
and can dance sing and act nothing conies amiss to me all the
players takes their characters from me
after this introduction you are a clever fellow i'll be bound for
it said dashall
o yes i acts richard the third sometimes sometimes macbeth and
tom thumb i have played before mr kean then i acted richard the
third give me a horse starting into the middle the room no
stop not so let me see let me see how is it ah this is the
way give me a horse oh oh oh then you know i dies and down he
fell on the floor which created a general roar laughter while
billy waters struck up see the conquering hero conies to the
inexpressible delight all around him their feet and hands all going
at the same time
mother mapps dropp'd her pipe and d d the weed it made her sick
she said
limping billy was also evidently in queerstreet 
come said sparkle won't you have a drop more
thank ye sir was the reply and sparkle intent upon having his
gig out ordered a fresh supply which soon revived the fallen hero 
bosworthfield and richard was himself again
now said he i'll sing you a song and immediately commenced as
follows
my name's hookey walker i'm known very well
in acting and eating i others excel
the playerfolks all take their patterns from me
and a nice pattern too don't you see don't you see
oh glancing at his fingers it will do it will do
at cheltenham born i was left quite forlorn
when my father was dead and my mother was gone
so i came up to london a nice little he
and a nice pattern too don't you see don't you see
oh it will do it will do
a courting i went to a girl in our court
she laugh'd at my figure and made me her sport
i was cut to the soul so said i on my knee
i'm a victim love don't you see don't you see
oh it won't do it won't do
now all day i march to and fro in the street
and a candle sometimes on my journey i eat
so i'll set you a pattern if you'll but agree
and a nice pattern too you shall see you shall see
oh it will do it will do
this song which he declared was all made out his own head was
sung with grotesque action and ridiculous grimace intended no doubt in
imitation mr wilkinson in his inimitable performance this strange
piece whimsicality the dancing party was knock'd up and were sobbing
their holly half asleep and half awake on the table bowing as
it were to the magnanimous influence
 sobbing their holly laying their heads
 old tom the dustman and the irishman laugh'd heartily
and das hall tallyhoho and sparkle could not resist the impulse
to risibility when they contemplated the group before them the
bugdestroyer munched a candle and sluiced his greasy
chops with jacky almost as fast as they could supply him
with it when sparkle perceiving the boy was still at the door with the
runaway ass
come said he we'll start em off home in high style here you mr
bugman can you ride
ride aye to be sure i can any mr ashley's horses as well as the
champion england was the reply
 old tom it is customary in publichouses and ginshops
in london and its vicinity to exhibit a cask inscribed with
large letters old tom intended to indicate the best gin in
the house
 munched eat
 sluiced washed see sluice
 chops the mouth
 jacky a vulgar term for gin
 any person would almost suspect that hookey had been
reading the newspapers by this allusion but that certainly
could not be the case for spurning all education in early
life this representative the immortal bard this
character characters from shakespeare could neither read
nor write but made all he acted as he said from his own
head however it may fairly be presumed that in the course
 his travels during the day he had heard something the
champion intended to appear at the approaching coronation
 whom the following account has recently been circulated
through the daily press and with his usual consistency
conceived his own innate abilities equal to those which
might be acquired by mr dymocke though his claims were not
equally honourable or advantageous
mr dymocke the nephew the gentleman who is a
clergyman entitled by hereditary right to do the service 
the champion to his majesty is still in hopes he may be
permitted to act under his uncle's nomination although he
wants a few months being age a petition is before the
king on the subject and mr dymocke by constant practice
at ashley's hidingschool is endeavouring to qualify
himself for the due fulfilment the office on thursday
lie went through his exercise in a heavy suit armour with
great celerity the horse which will be rode by the champion
has been selected from mr ashley's troop it is a fine
animal piebald black and white and is regularly
exercised in the part he will have to perform
walk in walk in ladies and gentlemen just going to begin come mr
merryman all ready ladies and gentlemen please to observe this here
horse is not that there horse
so we laugh at john bull a little
come then continued sparkle another glass halfacrown to
ride to the bottom the lane and up holboruhill on that donkey at the
door and you shall be our champion
a bargain a bargain said the assumed hookey walker rubbing the
tallow from his gills 
here goes then said sparkle then slipping halfacrown into the
boy's hand desiring him to run as far as the travelleroffice in
fleetstreet and get him a newspaper promising to take care his
ass till his return the lad nibbled the bait and was off in a pig's
whisper sparkle called to tom and bob and putting them up to
his scheme hookey was quickly mounted while dashall and his cousin
assisted by the hibernian and dustho succeeded in getting mother mapps
out who was placed in the front the champion astride with her face
towards him and limping billy who though beat to a stand still 
was after some difficulty lifted up behind hookey was then supplied
with his board the pole which he placed on his foot in the manner
 a spear or lance then giving the irishman and the dustman some
silver to act as supporters or esquires one on each side they
proceeded along shoelane preceded by billy waters flourishing his
woodenleg and feathers and fiddling as he went the irishman roaring
out with stentorian lungs
sure won't you hear
what roaring cheer
was spread at paddy's wedding o
and how so gay
they spent the day
from the churching to the bedding o
first in hand came father quires
with the bride's daddy the bailey o
while all the way to church the pipes
struck up a jilt so gaily o
kim ap be after sitting fast in the front there old mapps or
you'll make a mudlark yourself the dustman rang his bell and thus
accompanied with an immense assemblage boys girls men women and
 gills the mouth
 pig's whisper a very common term for speed
 beat to a dead stand still means completely unable to
assist himself
children collected from all the courts and alleys in the
neighbourhood joining in a chorus shouts that rent the air poor
balaam continued to bear his load while our party after watching them
till nearly out sight passed down harpalley into fleetmarket and
turning to the right very soon regained fleetstreet laughing heartily
at the bull's cookery mackarel buttered with brickdust and very
well satisfied with their spree
engaged in conversation upon this adventure they found nothing 
interest or amusement to attract their notice till they arrived at the
warehouse the london genuine tea company except merely remarking the
grand appearance st paul's from that situation
genuine tea said bob what can that mean is tea any thing but tea
to be sure it is said sparkle or has been any thing but teal
strongly marking the latter part the
 tea and coffee the adulteration articles human food
is a practice the most nefarious description and cannot
be too strongly deprecated although it has been carried to
an alarming extent there is scarcely an article ordinary
consumption but has been unlawfully adulterated and in many
cases rendered injurious by the infamous and fraudulent
practice interested persons bread which is considered
to be the staff life and beer and ale the universal
beverage the people this country are known to be
frequently mixed with drugs the most pernicious quality
gin that favourite and heartinspiring cordial the lower
orders society that it may have the grip or the
appearance being particularly strong is frequently
adulterated with the decoction long pepper or a small
quantity aquafortis a deadly poison sugar has been
known to be mixed with sand and tobacco for the publichouses
undergoes a process for making it strong and
intoxicating but the recent discovery the nefarious
practice adulterating tea and coffee articles the
most universal and extensive consumption deserves
particular reprehension
tea has been adulterated by the introduction dried sloe
leaves the practice is not very new but its extensive
adoption and the deleterious properties ascribed to them by
physicians have been at length successfully exposed by
the conviction many the venders so it is hoped as
to prevent a repetition the crime the sloe leaf though
a spurious commodity when sold as tea might afford a
harmless vegetable infusion and be recommended to the poor
and frugal as a cheap succedaneum for the chinese vegetable
the establishment the genuine tea company on ludgatehill
originated in the recent discoveries promising to sell
nothing but the unadulterated tea and it is sincerely to be
hoped has done some good
sentence as he spoke it horsebeans have been converted to
coffee and sloeleaves have been transformed into tea hog's lard has
been manufactured for butter an ingenious gentleman wishes to persuade
us periwinkles are young lobsters and another has proposed to
extract sugar and some say brandy out peashells london is the
mart for inventions and discoveries all kinds and every one its
inhabitants appears to have studied something the art legerdemain
to catch the eye and deceive the senses
wonderful exclaimed bob
not more wonderful than true continued sparkle invention is always
on the stretch in london here we have castiron bridges a castiron
sugarhouse
 sparkle appears to have been rather sceptical on the
subject periwinkles being young lobsters though the
opinion is not very new a gentleman whose indefatigable
research appears to be deserving encouragement and
support has recently issued the following advertisement
inviting the curious and the learned to inspect the result
 his discoveries which seems at least to warrant
something more than conjecture
j leghorn having in his possession some specimens which
prove in his opinion a circumstance before suggested but
treated by the scientific as a vulgar error any known
naturalist willing to view them by noticing by letter
within a week may have j c attend with his specimens the
subject is a curious change in the formation lobsters
from various species the winkle the winkle being
considered the larva
the only advantage j c desires from the communication is
the credit advancing his proofs and the stimulating
further enquiry a line addressed to j leghorn
architectural engraver no chapmanstreet blackroad
islington will have immediate attention
it is sincerely to be hoped that proper notice will be taken
 this advertisement for in times general scarcity like
the present such a discovery might be turned to great
national advantage by the establishment proper depots
for the cultivation lobsters as we have preserves for
game c
 castiron has become an object general utility the
southwark or new london bridge consists three arches the
centre which is a span feet and the other two 
feet each the vauxhall bridge consists nine arches over
a width feet and it is a fact that a sugarhouse is
building with castiron floors windowframes and rafters
to prevent fire castiron holds fire and resists fire but
it is probable that all its properties and powers are not
yet discovered and that we may some day or other witness
the ascension a castiron balloon inflated with steam
coaches running and barges packets and sailingboats navigated
by steam st paul's as you perceive without its ball smoke
burning itself and money burning men's consciences
well done sparkle cried tom your ideas seem to flow like gas
touch but the valve and off you go and you are equally diffusive for
you throw a light upon all subjects
bob was now suddenly attracted by a full view himself and his friends
at the further everington's
 steam here is a subject that evaporates as we approach
it soars beyond finite comprehension and appears to be
inexhaustible every thing is done by it machinery every
kind is set in motion by it a newspaper the most
extensive circulation in the kingdom is printed by it and
the paper supplied sheet by sheet to receive the impression
tobacco is manufactured and sausagemeat cut by steam
nay a celebrated vender the latter article had asserted
that his machinery was in such a state progressive
improvement that he had little doubt before long making
it supply the demands his customers and thereby save the
expense a showman but it is much to be regretted his
apparatus made sausagemeat him before the accomplishment
 his project
considering the increasing and by some philosophers almost
overwhelming population the country at the present
moment it is certainly an alarming circumstance that when
employment is so much required mechanical science should so
completely supersede it to the injury thousands
independent the many who have lost their lives by the
blowing up steamengines it is a malady however which
must be left to our political economists who will
doubtless at the same time determine which would prove the
most effectual remedy the recommendation mr malthus to
condemn the lower orders to celibacy the jack tars to a
good war or the ministers to emigration
 if an estimate the wealth or poverty the nation
were to lie formed from the appearance the houses in the
metropolis no one could be induced to believe that the
latter had any existence among us the splendour and taste
 our streets is indescribable and the vast improvements
in the west are equally indicative the former
the enormous increase rents for shops particularly in
the leading thoroughfares london may in a great measure
be attributed to the linendrapers the usual method
practised by some these gentry is to take a shop in the
firstrate situation pull down the old front and erect a
new one regardless expense a good outside being
considered the first and indispensable requisite this is
often effected either upon credit with a builder or if
they have a capital a few hundreds it is all exhausted
in external decorations goods are obtained upon credit and
customers procured by puffing advertisements and exciting
astonishment at the splendid appearance the front thus
the concern is generally carried on till the credit obtained
has expired and the wonder and novelty the concern has
evaporated when the stock is sold off at per cent
under prime cost for the benefit the creditors this is
so common an occurrence that it is scarcely possible to
walk through london any day in the year without being
attracted by numerous linendrapers shops whose windows
are decorated with bills indicating that they are actually
selling off under prime cost as the premises must be
cleared in a few days
the most elegant shop this description in the metropolis
is supposed to be one not a hundred miles from ludgatehill
the front and fitting up which alone is said to have cost
several thousand pounds the interior is nearly all 
lookingglass with gilt moulding even the ceiling is
lookingglass from which is appended splendid cutglass
chandeliers which when lighted give to the whole the
brilliance enchantment however it is not very easy to
form an idea what is sold for with the exception a
shawl or two carelessly thrown into the window there is
nothing to be seen the stock being all concealed in
drawers cupboards c except the decorations and the
dandy shorten who parade up and down in a state ecstasy
at the reflection their own pretty persons from every
part the premises
this concealment the stock has occasioned some laughable
occurrences it is said that a gentleman from the country
accidentally passing took it for a lookingglass
manufactory and went in to inquire the price a glass
the shorten gathered round him with evident surprise
assured him his mistake and directed him to go to
blades lower down the hill the countryman was not
disconcerted but after surveying them somewhat minutely
informed them it was glass he wanted not cutlery but as
for blades he thought there were enow there for one street
at least
another is said to have been so pleased with a row 
grotesque indianchina jars which embellish one side the
entrance and which he mistook for pots de chambre that
after returning home and consulting his rib he sent an
order per post for one the most elegant pattern to be
forwarded to him
there is a similar shop to this though on a smaller scale
to be seen in a great leading thoroughfare at the west 
 the town the owner which from his swarthy complexion
and extravagant mode dress has been denominated the
black prince a name by which he is well known in his own
neighbourhood and among the gentlemen the cloth this
dandy gentleman who affects the dress and air a military
officer has the egregious vanity to boast that the numerous
families rank and fashion who frequent his shop are
principally attracted to view his elegant person and seems
to consider that upon this principally depends the success
 his trade
 a large glassmanufacturer
 shop and without observing the other persons about him saw
himself surrounded with spectators unconscious being in their
company he look'd up he look'd down he gazed around him and all was
inconceivable light tom's allusion to the gas flashed upon him in a
moment what what is this said he where in the name wonder am
i a flash lightning could not have operated more suddenly upon him
why said sparkle don't you see
you are not here for you are there
pointing to his reflection in the lookingglass
egad said bob under evident surprise and perhaps not without
some apprehension they were playing tricks with him i wish you would
explain is this a drawingroom or is it the phantasmagoria we have
heard so much in the country
no no it is not the phantasmagoria but it forms a part 
metropolitan magic which you shall be better acquainted with before we
part that is no other than a linendraper's shop papered as
an irishman one day remarked void nothing at all at all but
lookingglass my dear one the most superb things the kind that
perhaps ever was seen but come i perceive it is getting late let us
proceed directly to dolly's take our chop then a rattler and hey
for the spell
bob appeared almost to be spellbound at the moment and as they moved
onward could not help casting
one longing lingering look behind
 rattler a coach
 spell the playhouse so denominated from its variety 
attractions both before and behind the curtain

to drurylane 
now said the hon tom dashall i shall introduce you to a new scene
in real life well worth your close observation we have already taken
a promiscuous ramble from the west towards the east and it has afforded
some amusement but our stock is abundant and many objects curiosity
are still in view
yes yes continued sparkle every day produces novelty for although

nature
by this time they had alighted and were entering the house the rapid
succession carriages arriving with the company the splendour the
equipages the general elegance the dresses and the blazing the
lamps alternately became objects attraction to bob whose eyes were
kept in constant motion while a bill the play for covent garden or
drury lane still resounded in their ears
illustration pages drury lane theatre
on arriving at the boxlobby tom who was well known was immediately
shewn into the centre box with great politeness by the boxkeeper
the second scene the tragedy being just over the appearance the
house was a delicious treat to bob whose visual orbs wandered more
among the delighted and delightful faces which surrounded him than to
the plot or the progress the performances before him it was a scene
 splendour which lie had not the least conception and sparkle
perceiving the principal objects attraction could not resist the
impulse to deliver in a sort halfwhisper the following lines
when woman's soft smile all our senses bewilders
and gilds while it carves her dear form on the heart
what need has new drury carvers and gilders
with nature so bounteous why call upon art
 the boxkeeper to a public theatre has many duties to
perform to the public his employer and himself but
perhaps in order to be strictly correct we ought to have
reversed the order in which we have noticed them since 
the three the latter appears to be the most important at
least in his consideration for he takes care before the
commencement the performance to place one his
automaton figures on the second row every box which
commands a good view the house who are merely intended
to sit with their hats off and to signify that the two
first seats are taken till the conclusion the second
act and so in point fact they are taken by himself for
the accommodation such friends as he is quite aware are
willing to accommodate him with a quid pro quo 
how well would our actors attend to their duties
our house save in oil and our authors in wit
in lieu yon lamps if a row young beauties
glanc'd light from their eyes between us and the pit
the apples that grew on the fruittree knowledge
by woman were pluck'd and she still wears the prize
to tempt us in theatre senate or college
i mean the loveapples that bloom in the eyes
there too is the lash which all statutes controlling
still governs the slaves that are made by the fair
for man is the pupil who while her eye's rolling
is lifted to rapture or sunk in despair
tallyho eagerly listened to his friend's recitation lines so
consonant with his own enraptured feelings while his cousin dashall was
holding a conversation in dumbshow with some person at a distance
who was presently recognized by sparkle to be mrs g den a
wellknown frequenter the house
come said he i see how it is with tom you may rely upon it he
will not stop long where he is there is other game in view he has but
little taste for tragedy fiction the realities life are the objects
 his regard
tis a fine tragedy continued he addressing himself to tom
yes yes replied the other i dare say it is but upon my soul
i know nothing about it that is i have seen it before and i mean to
read it
bless my heart said a fat lady in a back seat what a noise them
are gentlemen does make they talk so loud there ant no such thing
as seeing what is said i wonder they don't make these here boxes more
bigger for i declare i'm so scrooge i'm all in a fanny did you bring
the umbrella for fear it should rain as we goes home
hush mother said a plumpfaced little girl who sat along side 
her don't talk so loud or otherwise every body will hear you instead
 the performers and that would be quite preposterous
don't call me prosperous miss because you have been to school and
learnt some edification you thinks you are to do as you please with
me
 mrs g den a dashing cyprian the first order well
known in the house a fine wellmade woman always ready
for a lark and generally well togged
this interesting conversation was interrupted by loud
vociferations bravo bravo from all parts the house as the
dropscene fell upon the conclusion the second act the clapping 
hands the whistling and noise that ensued for a few minutes appeared
to astonish tallyhoho i don't much like my seat said dashall no
said sparkle i did not much expect you would remain long you are a
mighty ambitious sort fellow and i perceive you have a desire to be
exalted
i confess the situation is too confined replied tom come it is
excessively warm here let us take a turn and catch a little air
the house was crowded in every part for the announcement a new
tragedy from the pen lord byron particularly under the circumstances
 its introduction to the stage against the expressed inclination 
its author the
 at an early hour on the evening this tragedy was first
produce at drury lane handbills were plentifully
distributed through the theatre which the following is a
copy
the public are respectfully informed that the
representation lord byron's tragedy the doge venice
this evening takes place in defiance the injunction from
the lord chancellor which was not applied for until the
remonstrance the publisher at the earnest desire the
noble author had failed in protecting that drama from its
intrusion on the stage for which it was never intended
this announcement had the effect exciting public
expectation beyond its usual pitch upon such occasions the
circumstances were somewhat new in the history the drama
the question being whether a published flay could be
legally brought on the stage without the consent or rather
we should say in defiance the author we are not aware
whether this question has been absolutely decided but this
we do know that the piece was performed several nights and
underwent all the puffing the adventurous manager as
well as all the severity the critics the newspapers 
the day were filled with histories and observations upon it
no subject engrossed the conversation the polite and
playgoing part the community but lord byron the doge 
venice and mr ellison they were all praised and
plastered exalted and debased acquitted and condemned
but it was generally allowed on all hands that the printed
tragedy contained many striking beauties notwithstanding
its alleged resemblance to venice preserved we are
however speaking the acted tragedy and the magnanimous
manager who with such promptitude produced it in an altered
shape and having already alluded to the theatrical puffing
so constantly resorted to upon all occasions we shall drop
the curtain upon the subject after merely remarking that
the times the same day has been known to contain the
manager's puff declaring the piece to have been
received with rapturous applause in direct opposition
to the editor's critique which as unequivocally pronounced
its complete failure
will its publisher and the injunctions the lord
chancellor were attractions no ordinary nature and
 injunction the word injunction implies a great deal and
has in its sound so much the terrific as in many
instances to paralyze exertion on the part the supposed
offending person or persons it has been made the instrument
 artful designing and malicious persons aided by
pettifogging or pretended attorneys to obtain money for
themselves and clients by way compromise and in numerous
instances it is well known that fear has been construed into
actual guilt injunctions are become so common that even
penny print sellers have lately issued threats and promised
actual proceedings against the venders articles said to
be copies from their original drawings and even carried it
so far as to withhold kind souls the execution their
promises upon the payment a l from those who were
easily to be duped having no inclination to encounter the
glorious uncertainty the law or no time to spare for
litigation we have recently been furnished with a curious
case which occurred in utopia where it appears by our
informant that the laws hold great similarity with our own
a certain house considerable respectability had imported
a large quantity welsh cheese which were packed in
wooden boxes and offered them for sale a great rarity in
utopia as double gloucester
it is said that two a trade seldom agree how far the
adage may apply to utopia will be seen in the sequel a
tradesman residing in the next street a short time after
received an importation from gloucester the favourite
double production that place packed in a similar way
and as was very natural for a tradesman to do at least we
know it is so here the latter immediately began to vend
his cheese as the real double gloucester this was an
offence beyond bearing the high court equity was moved
similar we suppose to our high court chancery to
suppress the sale the latter but as no proof 
deception could be produced it was not granted this only
increased the flame already excited in the breasts the
first importers every effort was made use to find a good
and sufficient excuse to petition the court again and at
length they found out one the craft to swear that as the
real gloucester had been imported in boxes a similar
shape make and wood it was quite evident that the
possessor must have bought similar cheeses and was imposing
on the public to their great disadvantage notwithstanding
they could not find a similarity either taste smell or
appearance in the mean time the real gloucester cheese
became a general favourite with the inhabitants utopia
and upon this though slender ground the innocent tradesman
was served with a process enjoining him not to do that
which poor man he never intended to do and besides if he
had the people that country were not such ignoramuses as
to be so deceived it was merely to restrain him from
selling his own real double gloucester as their welsh
cheeses purporting as they did to be double gloucester
or mixing them together than which nothing could be
further from his thoughts and charging him at the same
time with having sold his cheeses under their name but the
most curious part the business was the real cheeseman
brought the investigation before the court cheeses in boxes
were produced and evidence was brought forward when as
the charges alleged could not be substantiated the
restraint was removed and the three importers welsh
cheese hung their heads and retired in dudgeon
the hon tom availed himself the circumstance to leave the box
though the truth was there were other attractions a more enlivening
cast in his view
come said he we shall have a better opportunity seeing the
house and its decorations by getting nearer to the curtain besides
ave shall have a bird'seye view the company in all quarters from
the seat the gods to the pit
the influx company it being the time halfprice and the
rush and confusion which took place in all parts at this moment were
indescribable jumping over boxes and obtaining seats by any means
regardless politeness or even decorum bucks and bloods warm
from the pleasures the bottle dashing belles and flaming beaux
squabbling and almost fighting rendered the amusements before the
curtain a momentary interest which appeared to obliterate the
recollection what they had previously witnessed in the mean time
the gods in the gallery issued forth an abundant variety discordant
sounds from their elevated situation growling bears grunting 
hogs braying donkeys gobbling turkeys hissing geese
the catcall and the loud shrill whistle were heard in one mingling
concatenation excellent imitation and undistinguished variety during
which tom led the way to the upper boxes where upon arriving he
was evidently disappointed at not meeting the party who had been
seen occupying a seat on the left side the house besides having
sacrificed a front seat to be now compelled to take one at the very
back part a side box an exchange by no means advantageous for a view
 the performance however this was compensated in some degree by a
more extensive prospect round the house and his eyes were seen moving
in all directions without seeming to know where to fix while sparkle
and bob were attracted by a fight in the gallery between a soldier and
a gentleman's servant in livery for some supposed insult offered
to the companion the latter and which promised serious results
from the repeated vociferations those around them throw em
over throw em over while the gifts the gods were plentifully
showered down upon the inhabitants the lower regions in the shape
 orangepeelings apples c the drawing up the curtain however
seemed to have some little effect upon the audience and in a moment the
babel tongues was changed into a pretty general cry down down
in the front hats off silence c which at length subsided in every
quarter but the gallery where still some muttering and murmuring were
at intervals to be heard
one fiddle will
produce a tiny flourish still
sparkle could neither see nor hear the performance tom was wholly
engaged in observing the company and bob alternately straining his neck
to get a view the stage and then towards the noisy inhabitants 
the upper regions we dined at the hummums said a finicking little
gentleman just below him bill and i and harry drank claret like
fishes harry was halfsprung fell out with a parson about chopping
logic you know harry's father was a butcher and used to chopping
so it was all prime the parson wouldn't be convinced though harry
knock'd down his argument with his knuckles on the table almost hard
enough to split it it was a bangup lark harry got in a passion
doffed his toggery and was going to show fight so then the parson
sneak'd off such a bit gig
silence there behind
so then continued the dandy we went to the billiardrooms in fleet
street played three games diddled the flats bilk'd the marker and
bolted i say when did you see dolly
 to the frequenters drurylane theatre who occasionally
lounge away a little their time between the acts in
sipping sodawater negus c the party here alluded to
cannot but be well known we mean particularly the laffing
boys and the lads the village we are aware that
fictitious names are assumed or given to the ladies 
saloon notoriety originating in particular circumstances
and we have reason to believe that dolly k ally has been
so denominated from the propensity she almost invariably
manifests painting as remarked particularly by one 
the parties in conversation
last night replied the other she'll be here
presently d nd fine girl ain't she
very well said the first a nice plump face but then she paints
so d n ably i hate your painted dolly give me natural flesh and
blood polly h ward for me
gallows tom will speak to you in plain terms if you trespass there
my boy you know he has outgeneral's the captain in that quarter and
came off victorious so 
come said sparkle let us adjourn into the saloon for heaven
knows it is useless staying here and taking their arms they
immediately left the box
the theatre continued he is a sort enchanted island where
nothing appears as it really is nor what it should be in london it is
a sort timekiller or exchange looks and smiles it is frequented
by persons all degrees and qualities whatsoever here lords come
to laugh and be laughed at knights to learn the amorous smirk and

this house was built upon a grand and extensive scale designed and
executed under the inspection mr bent wyatt the architect whose

is altogether a masterpiece art and an ornament to the metropolis
you perceive the interior is truly delightful and the exterior presents
the idea solidity and security it affords sitting room for

 it appears that the adoption fictitious names is not
wholly confined to the female visitors these regions

and is a sort general friend at all times full fun
fire and spirit we have not been able to discover whether
he holds any official situation under government though it
is generally believed he is safely anchored under the croup

so than to his own and we should judge from what is to be
inferred from the conversation overheard that he is the

atlantic first blazed forth to astonish the world beneath this roof
old drury immortalized the name garrick and has also established the
fame mr kean and the house at the present moment has to boast a

come along come along said tom interrupting him leave these
explanations for another opportunity here is the saloon now for a peep
at old particulars there is no seeing nor hearing the play i have no
inclination for histories i am just alive for a bit gig
on entering the saloon bob was additionally gratified at viewing
the splendour its decorations the arched ceiling the two massy
corinthian columns vera antique and the ten corresponding
pilasters on each side struck him as particularly beautiful and he was
for some moments lost in contemplation while his friends sparkle and
tom were in immediate request to receive the congratulations their
acquaintance
where the d l have you been to was the first question addressed
to dashall rusticating i suppose to the serious loss all polished
society
you are right in the first part your reply said tom but as i
conceive not exactly so in the inference you draw from it
modesty by jove well done dashall this travelling appears to improve
your manners wonderfully and i dare say if you had staid away another
month your old friends would not have known you
this created a laugh among the party which roused bob from his reverie
who turning round rather hastily trod with considerable force upon
the gouty toe an old debauchee in spectacles who in the height
 ecstasy was at that moment entering into a treaty amity with a
pretty rosyfaced little girl and chucking her under the
 the names ellison pope johnston powell dowton

chin as a sort preliminary to be succeeded by a ratification
for in all probability gratification was out the question however
this might be the pain occasioned by the sudden movement tallyhoho
who had not yet learned to trip it lightly along the mutton walk 
induced the sufferer to roar out most lustily a circumstance which
immediately attracted the attention every one in the room and in a
moment they were surrounded by a group lads and lasses
illustration pages tom and bob at drury lane
upon my soul sir stammered out bob i beg your pardon i i did
not mean 
oh oh oh continued the gouty amoroso mother k p came
running like lightning with a glass water the frail sisterhood
were laughing nodding whispering and winking at each other while
st ns who pick'd up the spectacles the unfortunate victim 
the gout had dropp'd swore that fellow in the green coat and white
hat ought to be sent to some dancingschool to learn to step without
kicking people's shins
another declared he was a johnnyraw just catched and what could be
expected
tom who however kept himself alive to the passing occurrences
stepping up to bob was immediately recognized by all around him and
passing a significant wink declared it was an accident and begged to
assist the old buck to a seat which being accomplished he declared
he had not had his shoe on for a week but as he found himself able to
walk he could not resist the temptation taking a look around him
over a bottle wine the unpleasant impressions made by this
unfortunate occurrence appeared to be removed in the mean time tom
received a hundred congratulations and salutations while sparkle after
a glass or two was missing
dashall informed the friends around him that his cousin was a pupil 
his and begged to introduce him
 mutton walk a flash term recently adopted to denominate
the saloon
 a well known fruitwoman who is in constant attendance
well acquainted with the girls and their protectors and
ready upon all occasions to give or convey information for
the benefit both parties
 st ns a very pretty roundfaced young ladybird 
rather small figure inclining to be lusty
 johnny raw a country bumpkin
as a future visitor to this gay scene this had an instantaneous
effect upon the trading fair ones who began immediately to throw out
their lures one declared he had a sweet pretty brooch another that
she knew he was a trump by the cut his jib a third that he look'd
like a gentleman for she liked the make his mug a fourth that his
hat was a very pretty shaped one although it was a radical colour
and while tom and the ladybirdl were soothing the pains the
greyheaded wanton bob was as busily employed in handing about the
contents the bottle a second and a third succeeded and it was nota
little astonishing to him that every bottle improved his appearance
for though not one his admirers remained long with him yet the
absence one only brought another equally attracted by his look and
manner every one declared he was really a gentleman in every respect
and in the course their short parley did not fail to slip a card
into his hand by this time he began to grow chatty and was enabled
to rally in turn the observations they made he swore he lov'd them all
round and once or twice hummed over
dear creatures we can't do without them
they're all that is sweet and seducing to man
looking sighing about and about them
we doat on them do for them all that we can
the play being over brought a considerable influx company into
the saloon the regular copies paired off with their caresses and the
moving panorama elegance and fashion presented a scene that was truly
delightful to bob
the ladybird who had been so attentive to the gouty customer now
wished him a good night for said she there is my friend and so i
am off this seemed only to increase the agony his already agonized
toe notwithstanding which he presently toddled off and was seen no
more for the evening
what's become sparkle enquired tom stole away was the reply
tipp'd us the double has he said dashall well what think you 
drurylane
 ladybird a dashing cyprian
 the term friend is in constant use among accessible
ladies and signifies their protector or keeper
tis a very delightful tragedy indeed but performed in the most
comical manner i ever witnessed in my life
pshaw said bob very few indeed except the critics and the plebs
come here to look at the play they come to see and be seen
egad then said bob a great many have been gratified tonight and
perhaps i have been highly honoured for every person that has passed me
has complimented me with a stare
which course you did not fail to return
certainly not and upon my soul you have a choice show fruit here
yes continued tom london is a sort hothouse where fruit is
forced into ripeness by the fostering and liberal sun folly sooner
than it would be if left to its natural growth here however you
observe nothing but joyful and animated features while perhaps the
vulture misery is gnawing at the heart i could give you histories 
several these unfortunates
 a life prostitution is a life fraught with too many
miseries to be collected in any moderate compass the mode
in which they are treated by parties who live upon the
produce their infamy the rude and boisterous nay often
brutal manner in which they are used by those with whom they
occasionally associate and the horrible reflections 
their own minds are too frequently and too fatally
attempted to be obliterated by recourse to the bacchanalian
fount reason becomes obscured and all decency and
propriety abandoned passion rules predominantly until it
extinguishes itself and leaves the wretched victim early
delusion vitiated both in body and mind to drag on a
miserable existence without character without friends and
almost without hope there is unfortunately however no
occasion for the exercise imagination on this subject
the annals our police occurrences furnish too many
examples actual circumstances deeply to be deplored and
we have selected one a most atrocious kind which recently
took place and is recorded as follows
prostitution 
an unfortunate girl apparently about eighteen years 
age and the most interesting and handsome person but
whose attire indicated extreme poverty and distress applied
to the sitting magistrate richard bimie esq under the
following circumstances it appeared from the statement
that she had for the last three weeks been living at a house
 ill fame in exeterstreet strand kept by a man named
james locke this wretch had exacted the enormous sum 
three guineas per week for her board and lodging and inconsequence
 her not being able to pay the sum due for the
last week he threatened to strip her her cloaths and
turn her naked into the street this threat he deferred
executing until yesterday morning having in the mean time
kept her locked up in a dark room without any covering
whatever when in lieu her cloaths he gave her the
tattered and loathsome garments she then appeared in which
were barely sufficient to preserve common decency and then
brutally turned her into the street being thus plunged into
the most abject wretchedness without money or friends to
whom she could apply in her present situation her bodily
strength exhausted by the dissipated life she had led and
rendered more so by a long abstinence from food her spirits
broken and overcome by the bitter and humiliating
reflection that her own guilty conduct debarred her from
flying to the fostering arms affectionate parents whom
she had loaded with disgrace and misery and the now
inevitable exposure her infamy it was some time ere her
wandering senses were sufficiently composed to determine
what course she should pursue in the present emergency when
she thought she could not do better than have recourse to
the justice her country against the villain lock who had
so basely treated her and after extreme pain and
difficulty she succeeded in dragging her enfeebled limbs to
the office during the detail the foregoing particulars
she seemed overwhelmed with shame and remorse and at times
sobbed so violently as to render her voice inarticulate her
piteous case excited the attention and sympathy all
present and it was much to the general satisfaction that
mr bimie ordered humphrey one the conductors the
patrol to fetch lock to the office on being brought there
the necessary proceedings were gone into for the purpose 
indicting the house as a common brothel
it was afterwards discovered that this unhappy girl was 
the most respectable parents and for the last six years had
been residing with her aunt about three months ago some
difference having arisen between them she absconded taking
with her only a few shillings and the clothes she then
wore the first night her remaining from home she went to
drurylane theatre and was there pick'd up by a genteel
woman dressed in black who having learned her situation
enticed her to a house in hartstreet coventgarden where
the ruin the poor girl was finally effected it was not
until she had immersed herself in vice and folly that she
reflected on her situation and it was then too late to
retract and after suffering unheard miseries was in
the short space three months reduced to her present
state wretchedness
the worthy magistrate ordered that proper care should betaken
 the girl which was readily undertaken on the part
 the parish
the prisoner set up a defence in which he said a friend
 the girl's owed him l and that he detained her clothes
for it but was stopped by mr bimie
he at first treated the matter very lightly but on
perceiving the determination on the part the parish to
proceed he offered to give up the things this however he
was not allowed to do
who are exercising all their arts to entrap customers apparently full
 life and vivacity who perhaps dare not approach their homes
without the produce their successful blandishments but this is not a
place for moralizing a truce to old care and the blue devils come on
my boy let us take a turn in the lobby
banish sorrow griefs a folly
saturn bend thy wrinkled brow
get thee hence dull melancholy
mirth and wine invite us now
love displays his mine treasure
comus brings us mirth and song
follow follow follow pleasure
let us join the jovial throng
upon this they adjourned to the lobby where a repetition similar
circumstances took place with only this difference that tally ho
having already been seen in the saloon and now introduced leaning upon
the arm his cousin the enticing goddesses pleasure hung
around them at every step every one anxious to be foremost in their
assiduities to catch the newcomer's smile and the odds were almost a
cornucopia to a cabbagenet that bob would be hook'd
tom was still evidently disappointed and after pacing the lobby once or
twice and whispering bob to make his observations the subject future
inquiry they returned to the saloon where sparkle met them almost out
 breath declaring he had been hunting them in all parts the house
for the last half hour
tom laugh'd heartily at this and complimented sparkle on the ingenuity
with which he managed his affairs but i see how it is said he and
i naturally suppose you are engaged
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind and i perceive clearly that
you are only disappointed that you are not engaged where are all your
golden dreams now
pshaw there is no such thing as speaking to you said tom rather
peevishly without feeling a lash like a cartwhip
 this was a touch the satirical which it appears did not
exactly suit the taste dashall as it applied to the
ladybird who had attracted his attention on entering the
house
merely in return continued sparkle for the genteel not to
say gentle manner in which you handle the horsewhip
there is something very mulish in all this said bob interrupting the
conversation i don't understand it
nor i neither said tom leaving the arm his cousin and stepping
forward
this hasty dismissal the subject under debate had been occasioned by
the appearance a lady whose arm tom immediately took upon leaving
that his cousin a circumstance which seemed to restore harmony to
all parties tallyhoho and sparkle soon joined them and after a few turns
for the purpose seeing and being seen it was proposed to adjourn
to the oystershop directly opposite the front the theatre and with
that view they in a short time departed but not without an addition 
two other ladies selected from the numerous frequenters the saloon
most whom appeared to be well known both to tom and sparkle
the appearance the outside was very pleasing the brilliance the
lights the neat and cleanly style in which its contents were displayed
seemed inviting to appetite and in a very short time a cheerful repast
was served up while the room was progressively filling with company
and mother p was kept in constant activity
bob was highly gratified with the company and the manner in which they
were entertained
a vast crowd dashing young beaux and elegantly dressed belles
calling about them for oysters lobsters salmon shrimps bread
and butter sodawater gingerbeer c kept up a sort running
accompaniment to the general conversation in which they were engaged
when the mirth and hilarity the room was for a moment delayed upon
the appearance a dashing blade who seemed as he entered to say to
himself
plebeians avaunt i have altered my plan metamorphosed completely
behold a fine man that is throughout town i am grown quite the rage
the meteor fashion the buck the age
he was dressed in the extreme fashion and seemed desirous 
imparting the idea his great importance to all around him he had
a lightcoloured greatcoat with immense mother o pearl buttons
and double capes buff or petersham breeches and coat 
skyblue his hat cocked on one side and stout groundashen stick
in his hand it was plain to be seen that the juice the grape had
been operative upon the upper story as he reeled to the further 
the room and calling the attendant desired her to bring him a bottle
 sodawater for he was lusty by g d then throwing himself
into a box which he alone occupied he stretched himself at length on
the seat and seemed as if he would go to sleep
that said sparkle is a distinguished member the tilbury club and
is denominated a ruffian a kind character that gains ground as to
numbers over the exquisite but he is very different in polish
 a partiality to these coloured habits is undoubtedly
intended to impress upon the minds plebeian beholders an
exalted idea their own consequence or to prove perhaps
that their conceptions are as superior to common ones as the
sky is to the earth
 the variety denominations that have at different times
been given to drunkenness forms an admirable specimen 
ingenuity well worthy remark the derivation lusty we
believe is from a very common expression that a drunken
man votes for washington but perhaps it would be rather
difficult to discover the origin many terms made use 
to express a jolly good fellow and no flincher under the
effects good fellowship it is said that he is drunk
intoxicated fuddled muddled flustered rocky reply
tipsy merry halfbooty topheavy chuckfull cupsprung

in the higher circles a ruffian is one the many
mushroomproductions which the sun prosperity brings to life stout
in general is his appearance but dame nature has done little for him
and fortune has spoilt even that little to resemble his groom and his
coachman is his highest ambition he is a perfect horseman a perfect
whip but takes care never to be a perfect gentleman his principal
accomplishments are sporting swaggering milling drawing and
greeking he takes the ribands in his hands mounts his box with
missus by his side all right ya hip my hearties drives his empty
mail with four prime tits cuts out a johnnyraw shakes his head and
lolls out his tongue at him and if he don't break his own neck gets
safe home after his morning's drive
he is always accompanied by a brace at least dogs in his morning
visits and it is not easy to determine on these occasions which is the
most troublesome animal the two the biped or the quadruped
this description caused a laugh among the ladybirds who thought it
vastly amusing while it was also listened to with great attention by
tallyhoho
the hon tom dashall in the mean time was in close conversation with his
mott in the corner the box and was getting as sparkle observed
rather nutty in that quarter the globe
the laugh which concluded sparkle's account the tilburyclub man
roused him from his sleep and also attracted the attention tom and
his inamorata

whom or whence the word originated but we recollect some
lines an old song in which the term is made use viz
when first i saw this flaming mutt
twas at the sign the pewter pot
we call'd for some purl and we had it hot
with gin and bitters too
 nutty amorous
 an elegant and expressive term for the eyes
this was followed immediately by the rattling an engine with
two torches accompanied by an immense concourse people following it
at full speed past the window
it is well lit by jove said the sleeper awake where ever it is
and with that he tipp'd the slavey a tanner and muzzled
the noise and confusion outside the house completely put a stop to
all harmony and comfort within
it must be near us said tom
it is covent garden theatre in my opinion said sparkle
bob said nothing but kept looking about him in a sort
 wild surprise
however said tom wherever it is we must go and have a peep
you are a very gallant fellow truly said one the bewitches i
thought 
and so did i said tom but rest the babe the time it shall
come never mind we won't be disappointed but here said he as i
belong to the tip and toddle club i don't mean to disgrace my calling
by forgetting my duty and slipping a something into her hand her note
was immediately changed into
well i always thought you was a trump and i likes a man that behaves
like a gentleman
something the same kind was going on between the other two which
proved completely satisfactory
so then mr author it seems you have raised a fire to stew the
oysters and leave your readers to feast upon the blaze
hold for a moment and be not so testy and for your satisfaction i can
solemnly promise that if the oysters are stewed you shall have good
and sufficient notice the moment they are to be on table but bless
my heart how the fire rages i can neither spare time nor wind to
parley a moment longer tom and bob have already started off with the
velocity a racehorse and if i lose them i should cut but a poor
figure with my readers afterward
pray sir can you tell me where the fire is really sir i don't
know but i am told it is somewhere by whitechapel
 slaveys servants either sex
 tanner a flash term for a sixpence
could you inform me madam whereabouts the fire is
westminster road sir as i am informed westminster and
whitechapel some little difference opinion i find as usual however
i have just caught sight tom and he's sure to be on the right scent
so adieu mr reader for the present and have no doubt but i shall
soon be able to throw further light on the subject
chapter xi
some folks in the streets by the lord made me stare
so comical droll is the dress that they wear
for the gentlemen's waists are atop their backs
and their large cassock trowsers they tit just like sacks
then the ladies their dresses are equally queer
they wear such large bonnets no face can appear
it puts me in mind now don't think i'm a joker
 a coalscuttle stuck on the head a poker
in their bonnets they wear green leaves such a power
it puts me in mind a great cauliflower
and their legs am sure must be ready to freeze
for they wear all their petticoats up to their knees
they carry large bags full trinkets and lockets
cause the fashion is now not to wear any pockets
while to keep off the flies and to hide from beholders
a large cabbagenet is thrown over their shoulders
in a moment all was consternation confusion and alarm the
brilliant light that illuminated the surrounding buildings presented
a scene dazzling splendour mingled with sensations horror
not easily to be described the rattling engines the flashing 
torches and the shouting thousands by whom they were followed and
surrounded all combined to give lively interest to the circumstance
it was quickly ascertained that the dreadful conflagration had taken
place at an extensive timberyard within a very short distance 
the theatres situated as it were nearly in the centre between covent
garden and drury lane men women and children were seen running in
all directions and report with his ten thousand tongues here found an
opportunity for the exercise them all assertion and denial followed
each other in rapid succession while the flames continued to increase
our party being thus abruptly disturbed in their anticipated enjoyments
bade adieu to their doxies
 doxies a flash term frequently made use to denominate
ladies easy virtue
and rushed forward to the spot where they witnessed the devouring
ravages the yet unquenched element consuming with resistless force
all that came in its way
button up said tom and let us keep together for upon these
occasions
the scamps the pads the diversity are all upon the lay
the flash molishers in the vicinity drury lane were out in
parties and it was reasonable to suppose that where there was so much
heat considerable thirst must also prevail consequently the sorceries
were all in high request every one those in the neighbourhood being
able to boast overflowing houses without any imputation upon their
veracity we say nothing elegant genteel or enlightened audiences
so frequently introduced in the bills from other houses in the
neighbourhood even the doorways were block'd up with the collectors
and importers information prognostications as to how and where it
began how it would and the property that would be consumed were
to be met at every corner snuffy tabbies and booty kids some giving
way to jocularity and others indulging in lamentations
hot hot hot all hot said a black man as he pushed in and out
among the crowd with hoot awa the deil tak your soul mon don't
you think we are all hot enough gin ye bring more hot here i'll crack
your croon i've been roasting alive for the last half poor an want to
be ganging but i can't get out
hot hot hot all hot ladies and gentlemen said the dingy dealer
in delicacies and almost as soon disappeared among the crowd where he
found better opportunities for vending his rarities
lumps pudding said tom jerking tallyhoho by the arm what do you
think a slice here's accommodation for you all hot ready dress'd
and well done
egad said bob i think we shall be well done ourselves presently
keep your hands out my pockets you lousy beggar
 scamps highwaymen
 pads footpads
 divers pickpockets
 the lay upon the lookout for opportunities for the
exercise their profession
 flash polishes a term given to low prostitutes
said a tall man standing near them or b me if i don't mill
you
you mill me why you don't know how to go about it mr bully brag and
i doesn't care half a garden for you you go for to say as how i 
take that then said the other and gave him a floored but he was
prevented from falling by those around him
the salute was returned in good earnest and a random sort fight
ensued the accompaniments this exhibition were the shrieks the
women and the shouts the partisans each the bruisers the
cries go it little one stick to it tip it him serve him
out ring ring give em room foul foul fair fair c at this
moment the firemen who had been actively engaged in endeavours to
subdue the devouring flames obtained a supply water the engines
were set to work and the foreman directed the pipe so as to throw the
water completely into the mob which had collected round them this had
the desired effect putting an to the squabble and dispersing
a large portion the multitude at least to some distance so as to
leave good and sufficient room for their operations
the devil take it cried sparkle i am drench'd
ditto repeated said tom
curse the fellow cried bob i am stopped
never mind continued tom
 by fellowship in woe
scarce half our pain we know
since we are all in it there is no laughing allowed
in a short time the water flowed through the street in torrents the
pumping the engines and the calls the firemen were all
the noises that could be heard except now and then the arrival 
additional assistance
bob watched minutely the skill and activity those robust and hardy
men who were seen in all directions upon the tops houses c near
the calamitous scene giving information to those below and he was
astonished to see the rapidity with which they effected their object
having ascertained as far as they could the extent the damage
and that no lives were lost tom proposed a move and sparkle gladly
seconded the motion for said he i am so wet though i cannot
complain being cold that i think i resemble the fat man who
seemed something like two single gentlemen roll'd into one and who
after half a year's baking declared he had been so cursed hot he was
sure he'd caught cold so come along
past twelve o'clock said a charley about three parts sprung and
who appeared to have more light in his head than he could shew from his
lantern
stop thief stop thief was vociferated behind them and the night
music the rattles were in immediate use in several quarters a rush 
the crowd almost knock'd bob off his pins and he would certainly have
fell to the ground but his nobly came with so much force against the
breadbaskets the groggy guardian the night that he was turn'd
keel upwards and rolled with his lantern staff and rattle into
the overflowing kennel a circumstance which perhaps had really no
bad effect for in all probability it brought the sober senses the
charley a little more into action than the juice the juniper had
previously allowed he was dragged from his birth and his coat which
was the blanket kind brought with it a plentiful supply the
moistening fluid being literally sous'd from head to foot
bob fished for the darker the musical instrument and the
post honour alias the supporter peace but he was not yet
complete for he had dropped his canistercap which was at length
found by a flash polished and drawn from the pool full water who
appeared to know him and swore he was one the best fellows on any 
the beats round about and that they had got hold a fireprigger
and bundled him off to st giles's watchhouse because he was
bolting with a bag togs 
 nob the head
 breadbasket the stomach
 keel upwards originally a sea phrase and most in use
among sailors c
 darker generally made use to signify a dark lantern
 musical instrument a rattle
 post honour or supporter his peace stick or
cudgel
 canistercap hat
 firetrigger no beast prey can be more noxious to
society or destitute feeling than those who plunder the
unfortunate sufferers under that dreadful and destructive
calamity fire the tiger who leaps on the unguarded
passenger will fly from the fire and the traveller shall be
protected by it while these wretches who attend on fires
and rob the unfortunate sufferers under pretence 
coming to give assistance and assuming the style and manner
 neighbours take advantage distress and confusion
such wretches have a more eminent claim to the detestation
 society than almost any other those who prey upon it
 bundled took or conveyed
the feeble old scout shook his dripping wardrobe d d the
water and the booty kid that wallowed him into it but without appearing
to know which was him till bob stepped up and passing some silver into
his manley told him he hoped he was not hurt and our party then moved
on in the direction for russelstreet coventgarden when sparkle again
mentioned his wet condition and particularly recommended a glass 
cognac by way preventive from taking cold a good motion well made
said tom and here we are just by the harp where we can be fitted to
a shaving so come along
having taken this as sparkle observed very necessary precaution
they pursued their way towards piccadilly taking their route under the
piazzas coventgarden and thence up jamesstreet into longacre
where they were amused by a circumstance no very uncommon kind in
london but perfectly new to tallyhoho two charleys had in close custody
a sturdy young man who was surrounded by several others and was
taking him to the neighbouring watchhouse what is the matter said
tom
oh tis only a little bit a dead bodysnatcher said one the
guardians he has been up to the resurrection rig here continued
he i've got the bonebasket
 resurrection rig this subject though a grave one has
been treated by many with a degree comicality calculated
to excite considerable risibility a late well known
humorist has related the following anecdote
some young men who had been out upon the spree returning
home pretty well primed after drinking plentifully found
themselves so dry as they passed a public house where they
were well known they could not resist the desire they had
 calling on their old friend and taking a glass brandy
with him by way finish as they termed it and finding
the door open though it was late were tempted to walk in
but their old friend was out temper what is the
matter matter enough replied boniface here have i
got an old fool a fellow occupying my parlour dead drunk
and what the devil to do with him i don't know he can
neither walk nor speak
oh said one the party who knew that a resurrection
doctor resided in the next street i'll remove that
nuisance if that's all you have to complain only lend
me a sack and i'll sell him
a sack was produced and the bacchanalian who
almost appeared void animation was without much
difficulty thrust into it give me a lift said the
frolicsome blade and away he went with the load on
arriving at the doctor's door he pulled the night bell
when the assistant made his appearance not unaccustomed to
this sort nocturnal visitant
holding up a bag and it was taken off his shoulder as he went
along mercerstreet so he can't say nothing at all
i have brought you a subject all right
come in what is it a man or a woman
a man
down with him that corner d n it i was fast asleep
call for the sack in the morning will you for i want to get to bed
with all my heart
then going to a drawer and bringing the customary fee here said hebe
quick and be off this was exactly what the other wanted and having
secured the rubbish the door was shut upon him this however
was no sooner done than the booty kid in the sack feeling a sudden
internal turn the contents his stomach which brought with it a
heaving fell from the upright situation in which he had been placed
on the floor this so alarmed the young doctor that he ran with all
speed after the vender and just coming up to him at the corner the
street
why said he you have left me a living man
never mind replied the other kill him when you want him and
making good use his heels he quickly disappeared
a comedian some celebrity but who is now too old for theatrical
service relates a circumstance which occurred to him upon his first
arrival in town
having entered into an engagement to appear upon the boards one 
the london theatres he sought the metropolis some short time before the
opening the house and conceiving it necessary to his profession
to study life real life as it is he was accustomed to mingle
promiscuously in almost all society with this view he frequently
entered the tap rooms the lowest public houses to enjoy his pipe and
his pint keeping the main object always in view
to catch the manners living as they rise
calling one evening at one these houses not far from drury lane he
found some strapping fellows engaged in conversation interlarded with
much flash and low slang but decently dressed he mingled in a sort 
general dialogue with them on the state the weather politics c
after sitting some time in their company and particularly noticing
their persons and apparent character
come bill it is time to be off it is getting rather
darkish ah very well replied the other let us have
another quart and then i am your man for a bit a lark
by this time they had learned that the comedian was but
newly arrived in town and he on the other hand was desirous
 seeing what they meant to be up to after another quart
they were about to move when said one to the other as weare
only going to have a stroll and a bit fun perhaps
that there young man would like to join us
ah what say you sir have you any objection but perhaps
you have business on hand and are engaged 
no i have nothing particular to do was the reply very
well then if you like to go with us we shall be glad 
your company
well said he i don't care if i do spend an hour with
you and with that they sallied forth
after rambling about for some time in the vicinity 
tottenham court road shewing him some the squares c
describing the names streets squares and buildings
they approached st giles's and leading him under a
gateway stop said one we must call upon jack you know
for old acquaintance sake and gave a loud knock at the
door which being opened without a word they all walked in
and the door was instantly lock'd he was now introduced to
a man squalid appearance with whom they all shook hands
the mode introduction was not however so satisfactory
a description as had been expected being very laconic and
conveyed in the following language we have got him
yes yes it is all right come jack serve us out some
grog and then to business
the poor comedian in the mean time was left in the utmost
anxiety and surprise to form an opinion his situation
for as he had heard something about trepanning pressing
c he could not help entertaining serious suspicion that he
should either be compellet to serve as a soldier or a
sailor and as he had no intention to gain a name in arms
they were neither them suitable to his inclinations
come said one walk up stairs and sit down jack bring
the lush and up stairs they went
upon entering a gloomy room somewhat large with only a
small candle he had not much opportunity discovering
what sort a place it was though it looked wretched
enough the grog was brought here's all round the gravestone
said one come drink away my hearty don't be
alarm'd we are rum fellows and we'll put you up to a rigor
two we are got a rum covey in the corner there and you
must lend us a hand to get rid him then holding up the
light what was the surprise the poor comedian to espy a
dead body a man you can help us to get him away and
by g you shall too it's no use to flinch now
a circumstance this kind was new to him so that his
perplexity was only increased by the discovery but he
plainly perceived by the last declaration that having
engaged in the business it would be no use to leave it
half done he therefore remained silent upon the subject
drank his grog when jack came up stairs to say the cart was
ready
lend a hand said one them let us get our load downstairs
come my master turn to with a good heart all's
right
with this the body was conveyed down stairs
at the back the house was a small yard separated from a
neighbouring street by a wall a signal was given by someone
on the other side which was understood by those within
it was approaching nine o'clock and a dark night come
said one them mount you to the top the wall and
ding the covey over to the carcasscarter this being
complied with the dead body was handed up to him which was
no sooner done than the carman outside perceiving the
watchman approach it won't do said he and giving a
whistle drove his cart with an assumed air carelessness
away while the poor comedian who had a new character to
support in which he did not conceive himself well up
was holding the dead man on his lap with the legs projecting
over the wall it was a situation the utmost delicacy and
there was no time to recast the part he was therefore
obliged to blunder through it as well as he could the
perspiration the living man fell plentifully on the
features the dead as the charley approached in a position
to pass directly under him those inside had sought the
shelter the house telling him to remain quiet till the
old scout was gone by now although he was not fully
acquainted with the consequences discovery he was
willing and anxious to avoid them he therefore took the
advice and scarcely moved or breathed past nine o'clock
said the watchman as he passed under the legs the dead
body without looking up though he was within an inch 
having his castor brushed off by them being thus relieved
he was happy to see the cart return he handed over the
unpleasant burthen and as quick as possible afterwards
descended from his elevated situation into the street
determining at all hazards to see the result this to him
extraordinary adventure with this view he followed the cart
at a short distance keeping his eye upon it as he went
along and in one the streets leading to long acre he
perceived a man endeavouring to look into the back part 
the cart but was diverted from his object by one the men
who had introduced him to the house while another the
confederates snatched the body from the cart and ran withall
speed down another street in an opposite direction this
movement had attracted the notice the watchman who
being prompt in his movements had sprung his rattle upon
this and feeling himself too heavily laden to secure his
retreat the fellow with the dead man perceiving the gate 
an area open dropped his burden down the steps shamed the
gate after him and continued to fly but was stopped at the
 the street in the mean time the charley in pursuit
had knock'd at the door the house where the stolen goods
as he supposed were deposited
 a cant phrase for money
it was kept by an old maiden lady who upon discovering the
dead body a man upon her premises had fainted in the
watchman's arms the detection the running
resurrectionist was followed by a walk to the watchhouse
where his companions endeavoured to make it appear that they
had all been dining at wandsworth together that he was not
the person against whom the hue and cry had been raised but
old noose l said it wouldn't do and he was therefore
detained to appear before the magistrate in the morning the
comedian who had minutely watched their proceedings took
care to be at bowstreet in good time where he found upon
the affidavits two his comrades who swore they had
dined together at wandsworth their pal was liberated
 the constable the night
bob could not very well understand what was the meaning this
lingo he was perfectly at a loss to comprehend the terms peabody
snatching and the resurrection rig the crowd increased as they went
along and as they did not exactly relish their company sparkle led
them across the way and then proceeded to explain
why said sparkle the custom deadbody snatching has become
very common in london and in many cases appears to be winked at by the
magistrates for although it is considered a felony in law it is also
acknowledged in some degree to be necessary for the surgeons in
order to have an opportunity obtaining practical information it is
however at the same time a source no slight distress to the parents
and friends the parties who are dragg'd from the peaceful security 
the tomb the resurrectionmen are generally well rewarded for their
labours by the surgeons who employ them to procure subjects they are
for the most part fellows who never stick at trifles but make a decent
livelihood by moving off if they can not only the bodies but coffins
shrouds c and are always upon the lookout wherever there is a
funeral nay there have been instances in which the bodies have been
dug from their graves within a few hours after being deposited there
it is a shameful practice said bob and ought not to be tolerated
however nor can i conceive how with the apparent vigilance the
police it can be carried on
nothing more easy said sparkle where the plan is well laid these
fellows when they hear a passingbell toll skulk about the parish from
alehouse to alehouse till they can learn a proper account 
what the deceased died what condition the body is in c with which
account they go to a resurrection doctor who agrees for a price
which is mostly five guineas for the body a man and then bargain
with an undertaker for the shroud coffin c which perhaps with a
little alteration may serve to run through the whole family
and is it possible said bob that there are persons who will enter
into such bargains
no doubt it nay there was an instance a man really selling his
own body to a surgeon to be appropriated to his own purposes when dead
for a certain weekly sum secured to him while living but in robbing
the churchyards there are always many engaged in the rig for notice is
generally given that the body will be removed in the night to which the
sexton is made privy and receives the information with as much ease ashe
did to have it brought his price being a guinea for the use the
grubbing irons adjusting the grave c this system is generally
carried on in little country churchyards within a few miles london
a hackneycoach or a cart is ready to receive the stolen property and
there cannot be a doubt but many these depredations are attended with
success the parties escaping with their prey undetected nay i know
 an instance that occurred a short time back a young man who was
buried at wesley's chapel on which occasion one the mourners a
little more wary than the rest could not help observing two or three
rough fellows in the ground during the ceremony which aroused his
suspicion that they intended after interment to have the body his
departed friend this idea became so strongly rooted in his mind that
he imparted his suspicions to the remainder those who had followed
him himself and another therefore determined if possible to satisfy
themselves upon the point by returning in the dusk the evening to
reconnoitre they accordingly proceeded to the spot but the gates being
shut one them climbed to the top the wall where he discovered
the very parties he had before noticed in the act wrenching open
the coffin here they are said he hard at it as i expected but
before he and his friend could get over the wall the villains
effected their escape leaving behind them a capacious sack and all the
implements their infernal trade they secured the body had it
conveyed home again and in a few days reburied it in a place 
greater security
bob was surprised at this description the resurrectionrig but was
quickly drawn from his contemplation the depravity human nature
and what he could not help thinking the dirty employments life by
a shouting apparently from several voices as they passed the 
st martin's lane it came from about eight persons who appeared to be
journeymen mechanics with pipes in their mouths some them rather
meritorious who as they approached broke altogether into the
following
song
i'm a frolicsome young fellow i live at my ease
i work when i like and i play when i please
i'm frolicsome goodnatured i'm happy and free
and i care not a jot what the world thinks me
with my bottle and glass some hours i pass
sometimes with my friend and sometimes with my lass
i'm frolicsome goodnatur'd i'm happy and free
and i don't care one jot what the world thinks me
by the cares the nation i'll ne'er be perplex'd
i'm always goodnatur'd e'en though i am vex'd
i'm frolicsome goodhumour'd i'm happy and free
and i don't care one d n what the world thinks me
 a circumstance very similar to the one here narrated by
sparkle actually occurred and can be well authenticated
 meritorious noisy
 this song is not introduced for the elegance its
composition but as the author has actually heard it in the
streets at the flight night or the peep day sung in
full chorus as plain as the fumes the pipes and the
hiccups would allow the choristers at those hours to
articulate and as it is probably the effusion some
shipmate in unison with the sentiments many it forms
part real life deserving being recorded in this work
particular trades have particular songs suitable to the
employment in which they are engaged which while at work
the whole the parties will join in in spitalfields
bethnalgreen c principally inhabited by weavers it is
no uncommon thing to hear twenty or thirty girls singing
with their shuttles going the death barbary allen there
was an old astrologer mary's dream or death and the lady
and we remember a watchmaker who never objected to hear his
boys sing but although he was himself a loyal subject he
declared he could not bear god save the king and upon being
ask'd his reason why said he it is too slow for as the
time goes so the fingers move give us drops brandy 
or go to the devil and shake yourself then i shall have
some work done
this song which was repeated three or four times was continued
till their arrival at newportmarket where the songsters divided our
party pursued their way through coventrystreet and arrived without
further adventure or interruption safely at home sparkle bade them
adieu and proceeded to bondstreet and tom and bob sought the repose
 the pillow
it is said that music hath charms to sooth the savage breast and it
cannot but be allowed that the yo heave ho our sailors or the
sound a fiddle contribute much to the speed weighing anchor
it is an indisputable fact that there are few causes which more
decidedly form or at least there are few evidences which more clearly
indicate the true character a nation than its songs and ballads it
has been observed by the learned selden that you may see which way the
wind sets by throwing a straw up into the air when you cannot make the
same discovery by tossing up a stone or other weighty substance thus it
is with songs and ballads respecting the state public feeling when
productions a more elaborate nature fail in their elucidations so
much so that it is related a great statesman who was fully convinced
 the truth the observation that he said give me the making 
the national ballads and i care not who frames your laws every day's
experience tends to prove the power which the sphereborn sisters 
harmony voice and verse have over the human mind i would rather
says mr sheridan have written glover's song hosier's ghost than
the annals tacitus

o what a town what a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
mayor common councilmen citizens and populace
wand'ring from poplar to burnham green

poets jews and gentlemen apothecaries mountebanks
there's bethlehem hospital and there the picture gallery
and there's sadler's wells and there the court chancery
o such a town such a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
o such a town and such a heap carriages
sure such a motley group was never seen
such a swarm young and old burying and marriages
all the world seems occupied in ceaseless din
there's the bench and there's the bank now only take a peep at her
and there's rag fair and there the eastlondon theatre
there's st james's all so fine st giles's all in tatters
where fun and frolic dance the rig from saturday to saturday
o what a town what a wonderful metropolis
sure such a town as this was never seen
a short time after this day's ramble the hon tom dash all and his
friend tallyhoho paid a visit to the celebrated tattersall's
illustration page tattersall's
this said tom is a great scene action at times and you will
upon some occasions find as much business done here as there is on
change the dealings however are not so fair though the profits
are larger and if you observe the characters and the visages the
visitants it will be found it is most frequently attended by turfjews
and greeks any man indeed who dabbles in horsedealing must like
a gamester be either a rook or a pigeon for horsedealing is a
species gambling in which as many
 turfjews and greeks gamblers at races trottingmatches
c
 rooks and pigeons are frequenters gaminghouses the
former signifying the successful adventurer and the latter
the unfortunate dupe
depredations are committed upon the property the unwary as in
any other and every one engaged in it thinks it a meritorious act to
dupe his chapman even noblemen and gentlemen who in other
transactions life are honest will make no scruple cheating you in
horsedealing nor is this to be wondered at when we consider that
the lord and the baronet take lessons from their grooms jockeys or
coachmen and the nearer approach they can make to the appearance
and manners their tutors the fitter the pupils for turfmen or
gentlemen dealers for the school in which they learn is such
a description that dereliction principle is by no means
surprising fleecing each other is an everyday practice every one
looks upon his fellow as a bite and young men fashion learn how to
buy and sell from old whips jockeys or rum ostler whose practices
have put them up to every thing and by such ruffian preceptors are
frequently taught to make three quarters or seventyfive per cent
profit which is called turning an honest penny this though frequently
practised at country fairs c by horsejobbers c is here executed
with all the dexterity and art imaginable for instance you have
a distressed friend whom you know must sell you commiserate his
situation and very kindly find all manner faults with his horse and
buy it for half its value you also know a greenhorn and an extravagant
fellow to whom you sell it for twice its value and that is the neat
thing again if you have a horse you wish to dispose the same
school will afford you instruction how to make the most him that is
to say to conceal his vices and defects and by proper attention to put
him into condition to alter his whole appearance by hogging cropping
and docking by patching up his broken knees blowing gunpowder in his
dim eyes bishoping blistering c so as to turn him out in good twig
scarcely to be known by those who have frequently seen and noticed him
besides which at the time sale one these gentry will aid and
assist your views by pointing out his recommendations in some such
observations as the following
there's a horse truly good and well made
there's the appearance a fine woman broad breast round hips and
long neck
there's the countenance intrepidity and fire a lion
there's the eye joint and nostril an ox
there's the nose gentleness and patience a lamb
there's the strength constancy and foot a mule
there's the hair head and leg a deer
there's the throat neck and hearing a wolf
there's the ear brush and trot a fox
there's the memory sight and turning a serpent
there's the running suppleness and innocence the hare
and if a horse sold for sound wind limb and eyesight with all the
gentleness a lamb that a child might ride him with safety should
afterwards break the purchaser's neck the seller has nothing to do with
it provided he has received the bit but laughs at the do 
nay they will sometimes sell a horse warranted to go as steady as ever
a horse went in harness to a friend assuring him at the same time that
he has not a fault any kind that he is good as ever shoved a head
through a horsecollar and if he should afterwards rear up in the gig
and overturn the driver into a ditch shatter the concern to
pieces spill ma'am and kill both her and the child promise the
conscientious horsedealer has nothing to do with all this how could
he help it he sold the horse for a good horse and a good horse he was
this is all in the way fair dealing again if a horse is sold as
sound and he prove brokenwinded lame or otherwise not worth
one fortieth part the purchasemoney still it is only a piece 
jockeyship a fair manouvre affording opportunities merriment
a very laudable sort company said bob
it is rather a mixed one replied tom it is indeed a complete
mixture all conditions ranks and orders society but let us take
a peep at some them do you observe that stout fellow yonder with
a stick in his hand he has been a daisykicker and by his arts and
contrivances having saved a little money is now a regular dealer and
may generally be seen here on selling days
daisykicker said bob i don't comprehend the term
then i will explain was the reply daisytickets are ostler
belonging to large inns who are known to each other by that title and
you may frequently hear them
 bit a cant term for money
 do any successful endeavour to overreach another is by
these gentlemen call'd a do meaning so and so has been
done
ask when did you sell your daisykicker or grogram for these
terms are made use among themselves as cant for a horse do you also
observe he is now in close conversation with a person who he expects
will become a purchaser
and who is he
he is no other than a common informer though in high life keeps his
carriage horses and servants lives in the first style he is shortly
to be made a consul and perhaps an ambassador afterwards the first
is to all intents and purposes a lord trade and his excellency
nothing more than a titled spy in the same way as a bailiff is a
follower the law and a man out livery a knight's companion or a
nobleman's gentleman
their attention was at this moment attracted by the appearance two
persons dressed in the extreme fashion who upon meeting just by
them caught eagerly hold each other's hand and they overheard
the following why bill how am you my hearty where have you
been trotting your galloper what is you after how's harry and
ben haven't seen you this blue moon
all tidy was the reply ben is getting better and is going to sport
a new curricle which is now building for him in long acre as soon ashe
is recovered
why what the devil's the matter with him eh
nothing any consequence only he got milled a night or two ago about
his blown he had one his ribs broke sprained his right wrist and
sports a painted peeper upon the occasion that's all
why you know he's no bad cock at the fancy and won't put up with any
gammon
no but he was lusty and so he got queer but i say have you sold
your bay
no d n me i can't get my price
why what is it you axes
only a hundred and thirty got by agamemnon lord it's no price at
all cheap as dirt but i say bill
 blue moon this is usually intended to imply a long time
 painted peeper a black eye
 axes among the swell lads and those who affect the
characters knowing coveys there is a common practice 
endeavouring to coin new words and new modes expression
evidently intended to be thought wit and this affectation
frequently has the effect creating a laugh
how do you come on with your grey and the piebald poney
all right and regular my boy matched the poney for a light curricle
and i swapped the grey for an entire horse such a rum one when
will you come and take a peep at him all bone fine shape and action
figure beyond compare i made a rare good chop it
i'm glad to hear it i'll make a survey and take a ride with you the
first leisure day but i'm full business no time to spare i say
are you a dealer
no no it won't do i lost too much at the derby besides i must go
and drive my girl out avait that's the time day my boys so
good by but if you should be able to pick up a brace clever
pointers a prime spaniel or a greyhound to match smut i'm your
man buy for me and all's right price you know is out the
question i must have them if they are to be got so look out bid and
buy but mind nothing but prime will do for me that's the time day
you know d n me so good by i'm off and away he went
some great sporting character i suppose said bob plenty money
no such thing said tom drawing him on one side you will hardly
believe that bill is nothing more than a showman to a linendraper
recently discharged for mal practices and the other has been a waiter
at a tavern but is now out place and they are both upon the
sharp lookout to gammon the flats the former obtains his present
livelihood by gambling spends the most his time in playing cards
with greenhorns always to be picked up at low flash houses at fairs
races millingmatches c and is also in the holy keeping the
castoff mistress a nobleman whose family he was formerly in as a
valetdechambre the other pretends to teach sparring in the city
and occasionally has a benefit in the minores duke's place and the
fives court
they talk it well however said bob
 snapped exchanged
 that's the time day that's your sort that's the
barber keep moving what am you after what am you up to
there never was such times that's the dandy go along bob
c are expressions that are frequently made use by the
people the metropolis and indeed fashion seems almost to
have as much to do with our language as with our dress or
manners
words are but wind many a proud word comes off a weak stomach
was the reply and you may almost expect not to hear a word truth in
this place which may be termed the sporting repository it is the grand
mart for horses and for other fashionable animals for expensive asses
and all sorts sportingdogs townpuppies and secondhand
vehicles here bets are made for races and fights matches are made up
here bargains are struck and engagements entered into with as much
form regularity and importance as the progress parliamentary
proceedings points doubt upon all occasions jockeyship are
decided here and no man fashion can be received into what is termed
polished society without a knowledge this place and some the
visitors the proceedings however are generally so managed that the
ostler the jockeys the grooms and the dealers come best off from
a superiority knowledge and presumed judgment they have a method 
patching up deep matches to diddle the dupes and to introduce throws
over doubles double doubles to ease the heavy pockets their
burdens the system puffing is also as much in use here as among the
lotteryoffice keepers the quack doctors or the auctioneers and
the knowing ones by an understanding amongst each other sell their
cattle almost for what they please if it so happens they are not
immediately in want the ready which by the way is an article
too frequently in request and here honest poverty is often obliged to
sell at any rate while the rich blackleg takes care only to sell to
a good advantage making a point at the same time not only to make the
most his cattle but also his friend or acquaintance
liberal and patrioticminded men said bob it is a noble society
and well worthy cultivation
it is fashionable society at least continued tom and deserving 
observation for it is fraught with instruction
i think so indeed was the reply but i really begin to suspect that
i shall scarcely have confidence to venture out alone for there does
not appear to be any part your wonderful metropolis but what is
infested with some kind shark or other
it is but too true and it is therefore the more necessary to make
yourself acquainted with them it is rather a long lesson but really
deserving being learnt you
 the ready money
perceive what sort company you are now in as far as may be
judged from their appearances but they are not to be trusted for i
doubt not but you would form erroneous conclusions from such premises
the company that assembles here is generally composed a great variety
 characters the idler the swindler the dandy the exquisite the
fullpursed young peer the needy sharper the gaudy pauper and the
aspiring schoolboy anxious to be thought a dealer and a judge the
article before him looking at a horse with an air importance and
assumed intelligence bidding with a trembling voice and palpitating
heart lest it should be knock'd down to him do you see that dashing
fellow nearly opposite to us in the green frockcoat topboots and
spurs do you mark how he nourishes his whip and how familiar he seems
to be with the knowing old covey in brown
yes i suppose he is a dealer
you are right he is a dealer but it is in man's flesh not horseflesh
he is a bum trap in search some friend
 bum trap a term pretty generally in use to denominate a
bailiff or his follower they are also called bodysnatches
the ways and means made use by these gentry to
make their captions are innumerable they visit all places
assume all characters and try all stratagems to secure
their friends in order that they may have an opportunity 
obliging them which they have a happy facility in doing
provided the party can bleed free among others the
following are curious facts
a gentleman who laboured under some peculiar difficulties
found it desirable for the sake his health to retire into
the country where he secluded himself pretty closely from
the vigilant anxieties his friends who were in search 
him and had made several fruitless attempts to obtain an
interview the traps having ascertained the place his
retreat from which it appeared that nothing but stratagem
could draw him a knowing old snatch determined to effect
his purpose and succeeded in the following manner
one day as the gentleman came to his window he discovered a
man seemingly in great agitation passing and repassing
at length however he stopped suddenly and with a great
deal attention fixed his eyes upon a tree which stood
nearly opposite to the window in a few minutes he returned
to it pulled out a in which he read for a few
minutes and then drew forth a rope from his pocket with
which he suspended himself from the tree the gentleman
eager to save the life a fellowcreature ran out and cut
him down this was scarcely accomplished before he found
the man whom he had rescued as he thought from death
slapped him on the shoulder informed him that he was his
prisoner and in return robbed him his liberty
another these gentry assumed the character a poor
cripple and stationed himself as a beggar sweeping the
crossing near the habitation his shy cock who
conceiving himself safe after three days voluntary
imprisonment was seized by the supposed beggar who threw
away his broom to secure his man
yet notwithstanding the many artifices to which this
profession is obliged to conform itself it must be
acknowledged there are many them who have hearts that
would do honour to more exalted situations especially when
we reflect that in general whatever illiberality or
invective may be cast upon them they rarely if at all
oppress those who are in their custody and that they
frequently endeavour to compromise for the debtor or at
least recommend the creditor to accept those terms which
can be complied with
bleed free
or other with a writ in his pocket these fellows have some
protean qualities about them and as occasion requires assume all
shapes for the purpose taking care their customers they are
however a sort necessary evil the old one in brown is a wellknown
dealer a deep old file and knows every one around him he is up to the
sharps down upon the flats and not to be done but in looking round
you may perceive men booted and spurred who perhaps never crossed
a horse and some with whips in their hands who deserve it on their
backs they hum lively airs whistle and strut about with their
quizzingglasses in their hands playing a tattoo upon their boots and
shewing themselves off with as many airs as if they were real actors
engaged in the farce that is to say the buyers and sellers when in
truth they are nothing but loungers in search employment who
may perhaps have to count the trees in the park for a dinner without
satisfying the cravings nature dining as it is termed with duke
humphrey others perhaps who have arrived in safety are almost afraid
to venture into the streets again lest they should encounter those foes
to liberty john doe and richard roe
if i do may i be the remainder the sentence was lost by the
speaker removing in conversation with another when tom turn'd round
o said tom i thought i knew who it was that is one the greatest
reprobates in conversation that i ever met with
and who is he
why i'll give you a brief sketch him continued dashall it is
said and i fancy pretty well known that he has retired upon a
small property how acquired or accumulated i cannot say but he has
married a barmaid very beautiful features and elegant form having
been brought up to the bar she is not unaccustomed to confinement but
he has made her an absolute prisoner for he shuts her up as closely as
if she were in a monastery he never dines at home and she is left incomplete
solitude he thinks his game all safe but she has sometimes
escaped the vigilance her gaoler and has been seen at places distant
from home
 it is related this gentleman whose severity and
vigilance were so harshly spoken that one day at table
a dashing young military officer who while he was
circulating the bottle was boasting among his dissipated
friends his dexterity in conducting the wars venus
that he had a short time back met one the most lovely
creatures he ever saw in the king's road but he had
learned that her husband so strictly confined and watched
her that there was no possibility his being admitted to
her at any hour
behave handsome and i'll put you in possession a gun
that shall bring the game down in spite locks bolts and
bars or even the vigilance the eyes argus himself
how d me if i don't stand a ten pound note
how why easy enough i've a plan that cannot but succeed
down with the cash and i'll put you up to the scheme
no sooner said than done and he pocketed the ten pound
note
now said the hoary old sinner little suspecting that he
was to be the dupe his own artifice you get the husband
invited out to dinner have him well ply'd with wine by your
friends you assume the dress a postman give a
thundering rap at her door which always denotes either the
arrival some important visitor or official communication
and when you can see her flatter lie and swear that her
company is necessary to your existence that life is a
burden without her tell her you know her husband is
engaged and can't come that he is dining out with some
jolly lads and can't possibly be home for some hours fall
at her feet and say that having obtained the interview
you will not leave her your friends in the mean time must
be engaged in making him as drunk as a piper that's the way
to do it and if you execute it as well as it is plann'd
the day's your own
bravo bravo echoed from every one present
it was a high thing the breach thus made the hornwork was
soon to be carried and there could be no doubt a safe
lodgement in the covertway
the gay militaire met his inamorata shortly afterwards in
chelseafields and after obtaining from her sundry
particulars inquiry as to the name her husband c
he acquainted her with his plan the preliminaries were
agreed upon and it was determined that the maidservant
who was stationed as a spy upon her at all times should be
dispatched to some house in the neighbourhood to procure
change while the man letters was to be let in and
concealed and upon her return it was to be stated that the
postman was in a hurry could not wait and was to call
again this done he was to make his escape by a ropeladder
from the window as soon as the old one should be heard upon
the stairs which it course was presumed would be at a
late hour when he was drunk
the train having been thus laid old vigilance dined out
and expected to meet the colonel but being disappointed
and suspicious at all times for
suspicion ever haunts the guilty mind
the utmost endeavours the party to make him drunk proved
ineffectual he was restless and uncomfortable and he could
not help fancying by the visible efforts to do him up that
some mischief was brewing or some hoax was about to be
played off he had his masterkey in his pocket and retired
early
his lady whose plan had succeeded admirably at home was
fearful having the door bolted till after twelve lest
the servant's suspicions should be aroused in the inhabitants our
own sphere action and i trust we shall all become better known to
each other
this piece information appeared to be truly acceptable to all
parties young mortimer was a goodlooking and well made young man his
features were animated and intelligent his manners polished though
not quite so unrestrained as those which are to be acquired by an
acquaintance with metropolitan associations
i am happy said he to be introduced to any friends your's and
shall be proud to number them among mine
you may replied sparkle with great safety place them on your list
though you know i have already made it appear to you that friendship is
a term more generally made use than understood in london
for what is friendship but a name
a charm which lulls to sleep
a shade that follows wealth and fame
and leaves the wretch to weep
and love is still an emptier sound
the modern fair one's jest
on earth unseen or only found
to warm the turtle's nest
these sentiments are excellently expressed said tom pinching him by
the arm and i suppose in perfect consonance with your own
sparkle felt the rebuke look'd down and seem'd confused but in a
moment recovering himself
not exactly so replied he but then you know and i don't
mind confessing it among friends though you are aware it is very
unfashionable to acknowledge the existence any thing the kind i
am a pupil nature
you seem to be in a serious humour all at once said young mortimer
can't help it continued sparkle for
let them all say what they will
nature will be nature still
and that usurper or i should rather say would be usurper fashion
is in no way in alliance with our natures i remember the old duchess 
marlborough used to say that to love some persons very much and to
see often those we love is the greatest happiness i can enjoy but
it appears almost impossible for any person in london to secure such an
enjoyment and i can't help feeling it
by the look and manner with which this last sentiment was uttered tom
plainly discovered there was a something labouring at his heart which
prompted it moralizing said he ah charley you are a happy
fellow i never yet knew one who could so rapidly change from grave to
gay from lively to severe and for the benefit our friends i can't
help thinking you could further elucidate the very subject you have so
feelingly introduced
you are a quiz said sparkle but there is one thing to be said
i know you and have no great objection to your hits now and then
provided they are not knock down blows
but said mortimer what has this to do with friendship and love i
thought you were going to give something like a london definition the
terms
why said sparkle in london it is equally difficult to get to love
any body very much or often to meet those that we love there are such
numbers acquaintances such a constant succession engagements 
one sort or other such a round delights that the town resembles
vauxhall where the nearest and dearest friends may walk round and round
all night without once meeting for instance at dinner you should see a
person whose manners and conversation are agreeable and pleasing to you
you may wish in vain to become more intimate for the chance is that
you will not meet so as to converse a second time for many months
for no one can tell when the dicebox society may turn up the same
numbers again i do not mean to infer that you may not barely see the
same features again it is possible that you may catch a glimpse them
on the opposite side pall mall or bondstreet or see them near
to you at a crowded rout without a possibility approaching
it is from this cause that those who live in london are so totally
indifferent to each other the waves follow so quick that every vacancy
is immediately filled up and the want is not perceived the wellbred
civility modern times and the example some very popular people
it is true have introduced a shaking hands a pretended warmth a
dissembled cordiality into the manners the cold and warm alike
the dear friend and the acquaintance yesterday consequently we
continually hear such conversation as the following ah how d'ye do
i'm delighted to see you how is mrs m 
she's very well thank you has she any increase in family any
increase why i've only been married three months i see you are talking
 my former wife bless you she has been dead these three years or
ah my dear friend how d'ye do you have been out town some time
where have you been in norfolk no i have been two years in india
this description a friendly salutation appeared to interest and
amuse both talltho and mortimer tom laughed shrugged up his shoulders
acknowledged the picture was too true and sparkle continued
and thus it is that ignorant one another's interests and
occupations the generality friendships london contain nothing
more tender than a visiting card nor are they much better indeed they
are much worse if you renounce the world and determine to live only
with your relations and nearest connexions for if you go to see them
at one o'clock they are not stirring at two the room is full 
different acquaintances who talk over the occurrences the last
night's ball and course are paid more attention to than yourself
at three they are out shopping at four they are in this place dashing
among the pinks from which they do not return till seven then they are
dressing at eight they are dining with two dozen friends at nine and
ten the same at eleven they are dressing for the ball and at twelve
when you are retiring to rest they are gone into society for the
evening so that you are left in solitude you soon begin again to try
the world and we will endeavour to discover what it produces
the first inconvenience a london life is the late hour a
fashionable dinner to pass the day in fasting and then sit down to a
great dinner at eight o'clock is entirely against the first dictates 
common sense and common stomachs but what is to be done he who rails
against the fashion the times will be considered a most unfashionable
dog and perhaps i have already said more than sufficient to entitle me
to that appellation
don't turn king's evidence against yourself said tom for if you
plead guilty in this happy country you must be tried by your peers
nay said mortimer while fashion and reason appear to be in such
direct opposition to each other i must confess their merits deserve
to be impartially tried though i cannot for one moment doubt but the
latter must ultimately prevail with the generality however her dictates
may be disregarded by the votaries the former
you are a good one at a ramble said tom and not a bad one in a
spree but i cannot help thinking you are rambling out your road
you seem to have lost the thread your subject and having been
disappointed with love and friendship you are just going to sit down to
dinner
pardon me replied sparkle i was proceeding naturally and not
fashionably to my subject but i know you are so great an admirer 
the latter that you care but little about the former
hit for hit said tom but go on you are certainly growing old
sparkle at all events you appear very grave this morning and if
you continue in this humour long i shall expect you are about taking
orders
there is a time for all things but the time for that has not yet
arrived
well then proceed without sermonizing
i don't like to be interrupted replied sparkle and there is yet
much to be said on the subject i find there are many difficulties
to encounter in contending with sin
by this time they were at the gate where finding the curricle and the
nags all in readiness sparkle and mortimer were soon horsed and tom
and bob seated in the curricle they proceeded to richmond taking
surveys the scenery on the road and discoursing on the usual topics
 such a journey which being foreign to the professed intention 
this work are omitted suffice it to say they returned refreshed from
the excursion and parted with a promise to meet again at nine o'clock
in grosvenor square
egad said dashall as they entered the diningroom there is
something very mysterious in all this sparkle has hitherto been the
life and soul society he seems to be deeply smitten with this young
lady miss mortimer and promises fairly by his manner to prove a
deserter from our standard and to inlist under the banners hymen
not unlikely replied tallyhoho if what we are told be true that it
is what we must all come to
be that as it may it ought not to interfere with our pursuits real
life in london though to be sure the ladies dear creatures ought
not to be forgotten they are so nearly and dearly interwoven with our
existence that without them life would be insupportable
after dinner they prepared for the evening party and made their
appearance in grosvenor squire at the appointed hour but as this will
introduce new characters to the reader we shall defer our account 
them till the next chapter
chapter xiv
ye are stars the night ye are gems the morn
ye are dewdrops whose lustre illumines the thorn
and rayless that night is that morning unblest
when no beam in your eye lights up peace in the breast
and the sharp thorn sorrow sinks deep in the heart
till the sweet lip woman assuages the smart
tis her's o'er the couch misfortune to bend
in fondness a lover in firmness a friend
and prosperity's hour be it ever confest
from woman receives both refinement and zest
and adorn'd by the bays or entreated with the willow
her smile is our meed and her bosom our pillow
arrived at grosvenor square they found the party consisted colonel
b his son and daughter miss mortimer and her brother mr
sparkle mr merrywell and lady lovelace the first salutations 
introduction being over there was time to observe the company among
whom miss mortimer appeared to be the principal magnet attraction
the old colonel was proud to see the friends mr sparkle and had
previously given a hearty welcome to mr merrywell as the friend his
nephew the young mortimer sparkle now appeared the gayest the gay
and had been amusing the company with some his liveliest descriptions
 character and manners that are to be witnessed in the metropolis
while merrywell who did not seem to be pleased with the particular
attentions he paid to miss mortimer was in close conversation with her
brother
tom could not but acknowledge that it was scarcely possible to see miss
mortimer without feelings a nature which he had scarcely experienced
before the elegant neatness her dress was calculated to display the
beauty her form and the vivid flashes a dark eye were so
many irresistible attacks upon the heart a sweet voice and smiling
countenance appeared to throw a radiance around the room and
illuminate the visages the whole party while lady lovelace
and maria b served as a contrast to heighten that effect which
they envied and reproved while tea was preparing after which it was
proposed to take a rubber at cards a sort general conversation took
place the preparations for the coronation the new novels the day
and the amusements the theatre were canvassed in turn and speaking
 the writings sir walter scott as the presumed author the
celebrated scotch novels lady lovelace declared she found it impossible
to procure the last published from the library notwithstanding her name
has been long on the list so much was it in request
sparkle replied that he had purchased the novel and would willingly
lend it to the ladies as for the libraries continued he they are
good places accommodation but it is impossible to please every one
either there or any where else they are however very amusing at times
and as a proof it i strolled the other morning to a circulating
library for the express purpose lounging away an hour in digesting
the politics and news the day but the curious scenes to which i
was witness during this short period so distracted my attention that
despite the grave subjects on which i was meditating i could not
resist lending an attentive ear to all that passed around me there was
something originality in the countenance the master the library
which struck me forcibly and the whimsical answers which he made to his
numerous subscribers and the yet more whimsical tone in which they
were pronounced more than once provoked a smile the first person
who attracted my notice was a fine showy looking woman dressed in
the extreme fashion with a bloom upon her cheek which might have
emulated that the rose with this exception that it wanted the charm
 nature putting a list into the hands the bookseller she
inquired if he had any the productions the names which were
there transcribed glancing his eye over the paper he replied with
an archness which not a little disconcerted her and which probably
occasioned her abrupt disappearance the fine lady madam is seldom
or ever at home but family secrets we are always ready to let out
characters eminent men growled out a little vulgar consequential
citizen whose countenance bore the stamp that insufferable
dulness that might almost tempt one to imagine him incapable 
comprehending the meaning the words which he pronounced with an air
 so much selfimportance characters eminent men repeated
the snarler in the same tone i much fear if we can boast a quarter
 that number eh mr margin i fear not sir replied margin
but such as we have are very much at your service better be in the
service the nation than in mine by far said the little purseproud
gentleman shrugging his shoulders very significantly shall i send
it for you sir said margin without noticing the last remark by no
means by no means the volume is not so large it won't encumber me
much i believe i shall find it small enough to put in my pocket
pursued the little great man grinning at the shrewdness his own
observations and stalking out with as much selfcomplacency as he had
stalked in i knew the man well and could not help laughing at the
lofty airs he assumed at the manner in which he affected to decry all
his countrymen without mercy at his unwillingness to acknowledge
any talent amongst them though he himself was a man that plodding
description who neither ever had done nor ever could do any thing to
entitle him to claim distinction any sort the young coxcomb who next
entered was a direct contrast to the last applicant both in person and
manner approaching with a fashionable contortion he stretched out his
ladylike hand and in the most languid and affected tone imaginable
inquired for the idler that sir said margin is amongst the works
we have unhappily lost but you will be sure to meet with it at any 
the fashionable libraries in the neighbourhood bond street or st
james's the young fop had just sense enough to perceive that the shaft
was aimed at him but not enough to relish the joke or correct the
follies which provoked it and turned abruptly on his heel he was met
at the door by a sentimental boardingschool miss who came flying into
the shop in defiance her governess and inquired in a very pathetic
tone for the constant lover that i am afraid said margin is
not amongst our collection dear me lisped the young lady with an
air chagrin that's very provoking i thought that was what everyone
had give me leave to assure you ma'am that you are quite
mistaken i fancy you will find that it is not to be met with all over
london
an old gentleman the old school whose clothes were decidedly
the cut the last century and whose stiff and formal manners were
precisely the same date with his habiliments next came hobbling
in poring through his spectacles over the catalogue which lay upon the
counter the first thing which caught his eye was an essay upon old
maids tom tom said the complaisant librarian calling to a lad at
the other the shop reach down the old maids for the gentleman
they won't appear to advantage i'm afraid a little dusty or damaged
with having laid so long upon the shelf he added with a simper which
was not lost upon any one present a melancholy looking man in whose
countenance meekness and insipidity were alike plainly depicted
now came forward inquiring in an under and what might almost be
designated an alarmed tone voice for the impertinent wife a
female who hung upon his arm interrupted him by entreating or rather
insisting in no very gentle tone that he would ask for something
better worth having margin affecting only to hear the former speaker
immediately produced the in question and observed with much
naivete that the impertinent wife was sure to be in the way at all
hours at the same time not omitting to recommend discipline as a
better work a young man whom i knew to be one the greatest fortune
hunters about town with an air consummate assurance put out
his hand for disinterested marriage that's a thing quite out 
date never thought now sir said margin who knew him as well as
myself allow me to recommend something more recent date something
more sought after in the fashionable world splendid misery sir
or the young man heard no more spite his impudence he was so
abashed by the reply that he made a hasty retreat the last person whom
i thought it worth my while to notice was a tall meagre looking man
whom i recollected to have seen pointed out to me as a wit and a genius
 the first order his wit was however that dangerous sort which
caused his company to be rather shunned than courted and it was very
evident from his appearance that he had not had the wit to work
himself into the good graces those who might have had it in their
power to befriend him though he spoke in a very low tone i soon
found that he was inquiring for plain sense on margin's replying
with much nonchalance that plain sense had late become very
rare finding himself disappointed in his first application his next
aim was patronage that sir said the wary bookseller is so much
sought after that i really cannot promise it to you at present but if
as i conclude you merely want something to beguile a leisure hour or
two probably the discontented man will answer the purpose very well
to this description sparkle the whole company listened with
attention and delight frequently interrupting him with bursts 
laughter tea was handed round and then cards introduced young
mortimer and merrywell seemed to take but little interest in the play
and evidently discovered their anxiety to be liberated having some
other object in view mortimer felt no great portion pleasure in
passing his time with his uncle the colonel nor with his sister lady
lovelace who was a perfect model london affectation besides his
friend mr merrywell who was to him what tom dashall and sparkle had
been to tallyhoho had made an engagement to introduce him to some 
his dashing acquaintances in the west nods and winks were interchanged
between them and could not but be noticed by tom and bob though
sparkle was so intent upon the amusements the moment and the company
 the lovely caroline as to appear immoveable
mr merrywell at length stated that he must be compelled to quit the
party young mortimer also apologized for as he and his friend were
engaged for an early excursion in the morning he should take a bed at
his habitation in order to be fully prepared this was the first step
to breaking up the party
merrywell called sparkle on one side saying he had something 
importance to communicate it was twelve o'clock and the gentlemen
after taking a formal leave the ladies and the colonel and a promise
on the part sparkle to meet them again the next morning at twelve to
escort them to the exhibition left the house
i am really happy said merrywell to sparkle as they passed the
door to have had the honour this introduction and shall have much
pleasure in becoming better acquainted with mr sparkle who though
personally unknown to me his name and fame are familiar
mr mortimer and myself are going to take a review the
neighbourhood st james's probably to shake an elbow
excellent said tom here is a fine opportunity for mr tallyhoho to
take a like survey and if agreeable we will join the party though
i am by no means a friend to gaming i conceive it necessary that every
person should see the haunts its votaries and the arts they make use
 in order to avoid them
you are right and therefore let us have a peep at them with this
they walk'd on listening with attention to the following lines which
were recited by sparkle
behold yon group fast fix'd at break day
whose haggard looks a sleepless night betray
with stern attention silent and profound
the mystic table closely they surround
their eager eyes with eager motions join
as men who meditate some vast design
sure these are statesmen met for public good
for some among them boast noble blood
or are they traitors holding close debate
on desp'rate means to overthrow the state
for there are men among them whose domains
and goods and chattels lie within their brains
no these are students the blackest art
that can corrupt the morals or the heart
yet are they oft in fashion's ranks preferred
and men honour if you take their word
but they can plunder pillage and devour
more than poor robbers at the midnight hour
lay deeper schemes to manage lucky hits
than artful swindlers living by their wits
like cunning fowlers spread th alluring snare
and glory when they pluck a pigeon bare
these are our gamesters who have basely made
the cards and dice their study and their trade
 gaming is generally understood to have been invented by
the lydian when they were under the pressure a great
famine to divert themselves from dwelling on their
sufferings they contrived the balls tables c and in
order to bear their calamity the better were accustomed to
play for the whole day together without interruption that
they might not be rack'd with the thought food which
they could not obtain it is not a little extraordinary that
this invention which was originally intended as a remedy
for hunger is now a very common cause that very evil
true said merry well as sparkle concluded though he did not
like the satire upon his own favourite pursuit those delineations are
correct and the versification good as far as it applies to the worst
species the gaminghouse
o said tom then pray sir which is the worst
nonsense said sparkle there is neither worse nor best these hells
are all alike sharks greeks gamblers knowing ones blacklegs and
decanters are to be met with at them all and they meet to bite one
another's heads off 
an admirable description truly the company you are about to
introduce us to gentlemen said tallyhoho
i don't understand greeks hells and blacklegs said mortimer and
should like an explanation
with all my heart replied sparkle hell is the general title now
given to any wellknown gaminghouse and really appears to be well
chosen for all the miseries that can fall to the lot human nature
are to be found in those receptacles idleness duplicity and
villany gaming is an estate to which all the world has a pretence
though few espouse it who are willing to secure either their estates
or reputations and these hells may fairly be considered as so many
halfway houses to the fleet or king's bench prisons or some more
desperate the love play is the most incurable insanities
robbery suicide and the extensive ruin whole families have been
known to proceed from this unfortunate and fatal propensity
greeks gamblers knowing ones and blacklegs are synonymous terms
applied to the frequenters the modern hells or gaminghouses
and may be distinguished from the rest society by the following
peculiarities in pursuits and manners
the greeks the present day though they may not lay claim to or
boast all the attributes the greeks antiquity must certainly
be allowed to possess that quality for which the latter were ever so
celebrated namely cunning and wariness for although no modern greek
can be said to have any resemblance to achilles ajax patroclus or
nestor in point courage strength fidelity or wisdom he may
nevertheless boast being a close copier the equally renowned
chief ithaca you will find him in most societies habited like a
gentleman his clothes are the newest fashion and his manners
 the highest polish with every appearance candour and honour
while he subsists by unfair play at dice cards and billiards
deceiving and defrauding all those with whom he may engage disregarding
the professions friendship and intimacy which are continually
falling from his lips
to become a good greek which by the way is a contradiction it
will be found necessary to follow these instructions
in the first place lie should be able to command his temper he should
speak but little and when he does mingle in conversation he should
most decidedly deprecate play as a source the greatest evil that
can prey upon society and elucidate its tendencies by striking examples
which are well known to himself and which are so forcibly impressed
upon his recollection that he is determined never to play deep again
but has no objection to a sociable and friendly game now and then just
to pass the time away a little agreeably by this means he may readily
mark down his man and the game once in view he should not appear too
eager in the pursuit it but take good care as the proverb says
to give a sprat in order to catch a herring this should be done by
allowing some temporary success before he make a final hit
there is perhaps no art which requires so much continual practice as
that greeley it is therefore necessary that the professor should
frequently exercise himself in private with cards and dice in order
that his digits may be trained to a proper degree agility upon which
the success his art principally depends he should also be accustomed
to work with some younger man than himself who having once been
a pigeon is become a nate that is enlightened and will not
peach consequently he serves as an excellent decoy to others
to ascertain the property the pigeon he intends to pluck is another
essential requisite and when this important information is obtained
which should be before he commences operations he should affect the
utmost liberality as to time c and make a show extending every
honourable facility to his opponent even by offers pecuniary
assistance by which means if he should be fortunate enough to have
it accepted he may probably by good management obtain a legal
security from him and thus be enabled to fasten on his prey
whenever he pleases
the title a military man such as captain is very useful to the
greek as it introduces him well to society and if he has once held a
commission in the army so much the better if not it can be assumed
so that if any unpleasant regimental peculation should be introduced
he may place his hand on the left side his breast declare he is
astonished and alarmed at the calumnious spirit the times shake his
head and interlard his conversation with commonplace ejaculations
such as the following indeed no why i know harry very well he's a
bit a blood can it be possible i should not have thought it bless
my heart exactly so good god a devilish good joke tho that's very
true says i so says he c c
a greek should be a man some personal courage never shrink from
a row nor be afraid to fight a duel he should be able to bully
bluster swagger and swear as occasion may require nay in desperate
cases such us peaching c he should not object even to assassination
he should invite large parties to dine with him frequently and have a
particular sort wine for particular companies he should likewise be
able to swallow a tolerable quantity the juice the grape himself
as well as know how to appear as if he were drinking when he is merely
passing the bottle and so manage it passing as to seem drunk at proper
times when good opportunities present themselves for the exercise
 his art and when a hit is really to be made he should positively
refuse to suffer play any kind in his house alleging that he has
seen enough it and cut the concern this serves to increase the
desire for it in others on any decisive occasion when a train is known
to be well laid he should appear to be drunk before any one the
party in which case he should take care beforehand to instruct his
decoy to pluck the pigeon while he as a supposed observer is betting
with some one in the company course an accomplice and is also a
loser
greeks who know each other are enabled to convey information by means
 private signals without uttering a word and consequently without
detection at whist or other games on the cards fingers are admirable
conveyancers intelligence and by dexterous performers are
so managed as to defy the closest scrutiny so as to have the natural
appearance pliancy while among the knowing ones their movements
are actually deciding the fate a rubber
egad said mortimer you seem to understand the business so well i
wonder you don't open shop
my knowledge continued sparkle is but theoretical i cannot boast
 much practical information for it is long since i shook the lucky
castor
o then you are discontented because you have no luck
not so said sparkle for i never play very deep so that win or
lose i can never suffer much but i am willing to give information to
others and with that view i have detailed the nature the houses
and the general character their frequenters according to my own
conception them the levanter is a blackleg who lives by the
broads l and the turf and is accustomed to work as it were by
telegraph with his pal and if you take the broads in hand in their
company you are sure to be work'd either by glazing that is putting
you in the front a lookingglass by which means your hand is
discovered by your antagonist or by private signals from the pal on
the turf he will pick up some nobleman or gentleman who he knows is
not up to the rig bet him fifty or a hundred on a horse pull out his
pocketbook set down the name and promise to be at the stand when
the race is over but takes care to be seen no more unless he is
the winner no 
street and both live in prime style the former in his
youth was an errand boy and he became so willing in doing
little jobs that his employers have paid him most
handsomely the latter gentleman who may be seen frequently
driving a bennet and looking both sides the road at
once is a chip the old block but as it is not our
intention to visit the sins the sou upon the father we
shall not enter into a minute examination him
no in burystreet is only about a year's standing
this table was set up by a broken adventurer capt b 
with mr a jeweller and a man whose agents keep a
house ill fame no way inferior in attribute to his
house in burystreet they commenced with narrow funds
and now thank the gulls are independent
the next door no is held by m g a mapseller
living at charing cross carl s formerly an understrapper
at ben t's living at king's road chelsea h ll
a tallowchandler living at no burystreet and
his brother a bricklayer residing somewhere off grosvenor
place these fellows have carried on their depredations for
some time but now have closed for awhile being one the
houses against whom a jew named portugal john and another
named the young black diamond have commenced proceedings
for sums had and received and by indictment
no in the same street is the property one o
d formerly a menial servant and not long ago a porter to
b l
these examples shew by incontestible inference that the
keepers those tables have an advantage which renders
their success certain while it fleeces the men who attend
them we always have seen these proprietors in the same
unchangeable affluence driving their equipages keeping
their country houses c c while those who play
invariably sink into poverty it has been often very often
remarked that young men who commence this career folly
and vice by degrees lose that freshness and fashionable
appearance which they at first possessed and at last are
seen wandering about st james's park counting the trees 
and dining on a gravel hash for want more genial fare
in a threadbare coat halfpolished boots a greasy hat and
a dirty cravat while the plunderers their happiness and
property are driving by them in luxury enjoying their
pleasure by contrast with their victim and sneering at his
miseries
 all the vices which deform this metropolis and there are
not a few the most ruinous is that rouge et noir
gambling for that is practised in the day time and it is a
matter astonishment to think that it has remained
undisturbed by the law and hitherto unnoticed by the press
at this moment no less than twelve these hells are open
to the public in the noonday and no less than five or six
profane the sabbath by their sinful practices although
london has been time out mind infested with the imps 
play yet it was not until within these last ten or fifteen
years that they dared open their dens to the honest light 
day about that period or a very short time before rouge
et noir was imported amongst other fashionable things from
france and to this game we are indebted for the practice 
gambling in the daylight
it is impossible to put down the vice gaming wholly and
not all the various enactments the legislature against it
have succeeded but that the ruinous and infamous practice
 indulging that vice in the midst crowded day should be
suffered for upwards sixteen years in the centre 
british society when it can easily be suppressed calls
forth our wonder and gives a stronger proof to us that our
societies for the suppression vice c c are shadows
with a name when the hazard tables open it is at an hour
when the respectable and controlled youths london are
within the walls their homes few are abroad except the
modern man ton the rake the sot the robber and the
vagabond and the dangers gaming on these orders 
society is little indeed when compared with the baneful
effects that vice upon the mercantile youth london it
is to this class and to the youth the middling orders 
society that gaming is destructive and it is upon these
that the rouge et noir tables cast the most fatal influence
young men this order cannot in general be absent from
their families after midnight the hour when the nocturnal
hells formerly yawned upon their victims but now the
introduction rouge et noir has rendered the abominable
track play a morning and evening's lounge set forth in
all the false glare which the artful proprietors can invent
to deceive the thoughtless and thus it affords
opportunities and temptations to such youth almost
irresistible
when the glittering london pleasures first meets the eye
 a young man placed upon the road a mercantile life or
when he enters any the multifarious departments in the
machine society which always lead the industrious and
prudent to honourable emolument he too frequently
misconceives the fashionable gamester's character and
confounds his crimes with elegant accomplishments the road
to pleasure is broad and the gates these hells are open
to him at hours when he can be absent and can indulge his
whim without suspicion for at first he looks upon his new
enjoyment but a mere whim which he can abandon at any
moment but how different is the proof he goes on his new
made wings carry him through a region delight and he
believes himself to possess the powers the eagle still
lighter he ascends and the solid earth on which he formerly
trod in safety recedes immeasurably from his giddy eye at
length his wings prove wax they melt before the sun and
the victim his own folly tumbles into the abyss 
destruction
it is no uncommon thing nay we will positively declare it
to be a very frequent practice these misled young men
when they have been initiated and have the temporary
command money belonging to their employers to go to the
rouge et noir tables armed as they think with
impenetrable armour a large sum and in the hope 
profiting to a certain amount risk that property the loss
 which would be the loss every thing dear to them in
society they believe from the greatness the amount they
possess that they can command a small gain and not for a
moment doubt they will be able to replace or return the
money entrusted to their care but little do they know the
fickleness luck and less do they suspect the odds and
imposing roguery arrayed against them their first loss is
trifling but they have to win that back iu addition to
their expected profits for this purpose they stake a larger
sum which if they lose increases their task and so on
until the halffrantic victims see no hope but desperation
and their remaining stock is placed upon the chance a
single card the event closes and the man who yesterday
enjoyed the good opinion the world and the esteem and
confidence his friends today becomes the veriest
outcast society these are common cases one which
for example we will describe as the facts occurred in the
year a clerk possessing the highest reputation
became a frequenter a rouge et noir table from the
nature his employment he had daily the command large
sums which for a short time he risked at play
successfully one day however he brought with him his
employer's money to the amount l the whole 
which in two days he lost we may judge the unhappy
young man's feelings by his subsequent conduct he wrote a
confession the affair to the man he wronged retired to a
tavern and blew his brains out
these gamingtables open at halfpast twelve o'clock
continue their orgies until five and recommence at seven in
the evening how many young men are passing their doors at
these hours with the property others in their pockets
and what a temptation to risk it it would seem as if these
places were set up as shops designed chiefly for the
accommodation midday dealers in illfortune as if
levelled directly at those men who cannot or will not spend
their nights in gambling and how the proprietors contrive
to escape detection and punishment is surprising
considering that the law affords ample means to put them
down
they know their customers and place themselves here to watch the
progress their gains their attentions are always directed to the
newcomers remorseless avaricious and happy unmarked with the lines
 care which contract and deform the faces their victims they
smile and smile and murder while they smile they will explain
the fairness the game and tell you the great losses they have
sustained but as this is no place for explanation we must look on and
say nothing
by this time merrywell and mortimer were mingled in the throng at the
table sparkle was engaged in conversation with an old acquaintance a
profusion money was flying about and a large heap or bank was placed
in the centre all was anxiety and for a few moments no sound was
heard but the awful numbers the eventful dealer every countenance
was hushed in expectation and every eye was fixed upon the coming card
which should decide the fate hundreds it was an awful moment to
every one engaged in the play but the pause was succeeded with a sort
 harlequinade movement to a scene confusion and uproar scarcely to
be conceived
the appearance at the door half a dozen persons armed with pistols
rushing past the guardians and bearing away all before them had
such an instantaneous effect upon the company that they all arose
as it were to receive them and the leader the party threw himself
suddenly upon the pile banknotes in the centre the table with
intent to seize the whole bank
confusion and dismay were now visibly depicted on every countenance for
some actuated by desperation at the prospect ruin and others by the
urgings avarice determined to have a scramble for the notes which
they commenced most furiously each one securing as much as he could to
himself there was tumbling and tossing and pulling and shoving mouths
stuffed with hundreds hundreds mouths that were supperless and
likely to continue so unless they could now make sure something
bank paper was literally going for nothing however the pistols being
the most powerful the armed forces succeeded in seizing the greatest
share the stock and a negative sort silence was at length
restored the party was materially decreased for seeing they were
betrayed every one after an endeavour to secure a share the spoil
deemed it necessary to make good his retreat and among the rest
our party who had not interfered with the play or assisted in the
entertainment soon found themselves in the street
egad said sparkle i think we are in luck to escape so easily
we might have been compelled to make our appearance at bow street
tomorrow an occurrence i would studiously avoid
well done old steady said tom it is not long you know since you
was there after a night's lodging in the neighbourhood
that was under very different circumstances continued sparkle in
defence a woman i would risk my life at any time but i would by
no means incur the imputation being a gambler it is a character i
abhor i have before said i would never venture into those dens again
to herd with swindlers all descriptions
they all seem gay fellows too said bob
yes replied sparkle but the character and conduct a young man
has ere now been altered in one night the evil effects produced by
initiation to those hells are incalculable
moralizing at midnight said tom an excellent title for a volume
sparkling contemplations
to be written by the hon tom dashall or the merry devil 
piccadilly was the reply
huzza said merrywell if this is the case our time will not be lost
in this excursion did you hear that lord has been compelled to put
down his establishment in consequence his losses at play pray don't
forget to mention that in the work
tis no new thing continued sparkle for lords the present day
since i believe there are few the nobility who are not either greeks
or pigeons indeed the list visitors to these places contains names
 many persons who should set better examples to the humbler classes 
the community for the unfortunate results this too fatal propensity
to parents and society have been severely felt among many instances
on record a very interesting one is related a young subaltern in a
regiment cavalry who by successive losses was reduced to such a
state distress as to form the desperate resolution trying the
road in a moment agony he accidentally met with an opportunity
which seemed to favour his design having learned that a certain
baronet recently returned from india with abundance wealth had laid
it out on landed estates in england and that he would on a certain day
cross the country with a large sum money after collecting his rents
he laid his plan for a meeting on a retired spot and succeeded in
stopping the carriage your money or your life said he presenting
his pistol with a trembling hand the baronet perceiving there was a
sort gentlemanly air about him which indicated something more than
might be calculated on in the character a highwayman presented him
with his purse a watch and a valuable diamond ring remarking he
could not help conceiving that he was unaccustomed to the trade and
that it was most desirable he should abandon it for ever the
young officer though considerably confused and embarrassed by this
observation was not to be disappointed his booty returned this
property and demanded the larger sum which for safety had been
concealed in the bottom the carriage the manner however in which
this was done only served to confirm the suspicions the baronet
which he could not help expressing as he acknowledged the accuracy 
the highwayman's information and produced the property observing he
was sure that circumstances no common kind could have impelled
him to this flagrant breach the laws he asked as a favour that he
would grant him an interview at some future period pledging his honour
that he should have no occasion to repent such a singular mark 
confidence
the officer replied that he had and he felt he could with safety
trust both his life and his honour in the veracity sir and
appointed a meeting at the london coffee house lydgate hill only
stipulating that at such meeting both parties were to be unattended
as the day meeting approached the baronet thought seriously the
solicited rencontre and after enjoining perfect secresy on the part 
his friend col entreated him to be his companion the colonel
laughed at the idea that any man who had robbed another should so
indiscreetly place his life in his hands had no conception his
keeping his appointment and solemnly assured the baronet that he would
in no case divulge who or what he was that he might become acquainted
with
the colonel ridiculed his friend's credulity as they entered the house
and were shewn to a private room the appointed hour was eight in the
evening and as the clock st paul's struck a gentleman inquiring
for sir was shewn into the room wine was ordered and for an hour
a general conversation on the popular topics the day ensued when the
gentleman evidently under deeply impressed feelings embarrassment
and disappointment in which the colonel seemed to partake arose and
politely took his leave
 well said the baronet what think you my highwayman now am i
not right is he not a gentleman
 and this is the robber is it sir said the colonel be assured
he shall swing for it why sir i know him well he is a in my own
regiment
hold said the baronet don't be rash remember the solemn promise
you have given and do not deceive me i hold you bound to me and will
not permit you to break your engagement i have better objects in view
than the death a fellowcreature
he then requested to be informed the general tenor the young
man's conduct which he found to be excellent and that he was an
indefatigable officer indeed said the colonel it would give me the
greatest pain to lose him an incomparably affectionate husband
and father he has but one vice to which may be attributed his
destruction viz his inordinate passion for gaming but i cannot feel
justified in screening so flagrant an offender the law must take its
course
moderate your indignation said the worthy baronet assuming a more
serious tone and remember you must be personalty answerable to me for
any disclosure you may think proper to make and that inasmuch as you
injure him you must injure me you have already given him so high a
character in every respect but one that i must interest you further
in his behalf and beg you to assist me in my endeavours to reclaim
instead punishing him
the colonel was surprised but the baronet was inflexible in vain
he urged that the magnitude the crime utterly precluded such a
proceeding
 it must be done said the baronet it shall be done leave all the
consequences to me he has now left us in extreme though suppressed
agitation there is no time to lose fly to save him
the colonel expressed his readiness to try the experiment
 then said the baronet follow him immediately assure him 
my forgiveness and that if he will pledge his word to forsake this
dangerous vice what he has already obtained he may hold as a gift and
i will add whatever may be necessary to extricate him from any temporary
embarrassment
it was an important embassy life or death was to be decided by it the
colonel took his departure certain finding him at home taking leave
 his family and reaching his habitation a short time after his
arrival witnessed a scene misery which although he had partly
anticipated he could not have conceived he found him surrounded by
his wife and children in an agony desperation and despair
when he entered the apartment the poor culprit convinced by the
presence his colonel that all was lost fell on his knees and
supplicated if possible that his fame not his life might be spared for
the sake his afflicted but innocent and injured family language has
no power to describe the surprise and consternation with which after a
severe lecture he received the joyful intelligence which
his colonel was the bearer he returned with his commanding officer
to square where he was received by the baronet as a repentant
friend and has lived to repair his error and become deservedly
distinguished as an ornament to society civil and religious as well as
military
that must be truly gratifying to the worthy baronetcy said tom
no doubt it continued sparkle it must be a source continued
pleasure to find his labours have had so beneficial a result having in
all probability saved a whole family from destruction surely it may be
said that
among the idiot pranks wealth's abuse
none seem so monstrous none have less excuse
than those which throw an heritage away
upon the lawless chance desperate play
nor is there among knaves a wretch more base
than he who steals it with a smiling face
who makes diversion to destruction tend
and thrives upon the ruin a friend
yet the greek like the swindlers and the horse jockey
 swindler is a term originally derived from the german
schwindel which signifies merely to cheat it was first
introduced as a cant term and used to signify obtaining 
goods credit or money under false pretences it has since
had a legislative adoption being parliamentary recognised
by an act for the prevention it the artifices schemes
and crimes resorted to by these gentry are so numerous
that it would be impossible to describe them all one mode
 practice however is not uncommon in london
three or four swell jews contrive to hire a large house with
some spare rooms in the city that are turned into
warehouses in which are a number casks boxes e
filled with sand and also a quantity large sugarloaves
in appearance which are only clay done up in blue paper
but corded and made up with great nicety
an elegant countinghouse is likewise furnished with books
and other apparatus to deceive the eye and give the
appearance extensive business great regularity and
large property the clerks in attendance are a set jews
who are privy to the scheme and equally ready at fraud as
those who profess to be the principals
a diningroom elegantly furnished upon the mace receives
you
the mace is a person who carries all the appearance a
great and rich man with servants carriages c for the
purpose defrauding tradesmen and others by all manner 
plans most calculated to entrap the parties they intend to
dupe
whenever it is necessary to admit your visits a black
servant opens the streetdoor and the foot the staircase
presents surtouts boots liverycloths a large bluecoat
with a yellow cape and habiliments in which the
opulent array their servants with these and similar
merchantlike appearances trade is commenced and persons
dispatched to provincial manufacturing towns to buy various
articles for the amount the first purchases bills are
drawn upon the firm and even before the goods are pack'd
up and sent according to order the acceptances are paid
and by this means credit is partly established which
once accomplished they are in want large assortments for
exportation upon credit at one two and three months the
goods are accordingly chosen and forwarded to their
associates in london where they are immediately disposed
 at or per cent cheaper than the prime cost and
the money realised the first bills become due are noted
and protested the second are presented but the house has
stopped payment and the owners are bankrupts by the time
the third month's bills become due the docket is struck
the assignees chosen and there is not sixpence in the pound
left for the creditors petitions are ineffectually
presented to the chancellor for a number fictitious
creditors the same profession and persuasion overswear
the just ones and by exceeding them in number and value
the house obtains its certificate and has again the power
 committing similar depredations
perhaps the most daring and systematic proceeding thief faded age
teeth for the toothless ringlets for the bald
heav'n earth and ocean plunder'd their sweets
nectareous essences olympian dews
sermons and city feasts and fav'rite airs
ethereal journeys submarine exploits
and katerfelto with his hair on 
at his own wonders wond'ring for his bread
well said tom it must be confessed that a newspaper is a most
convenient and agreeable companion to the breakfasttable laying
down the times as he spoke it is a sort literary hatchpotch
calculated to afford amusement suited to all tastes rank and degrees
it contains
tales love and maids mistaken
 battles fought and captives taken
then i presume said bob you have been gratified and interested in
the perusal
it is impossible to look down the columns a newspaper replied tom
without finding subjects to impart light and all the journals
 the present day the times appears to me the best in point 
information and conduct but i spoke newspapers generally there
is such a mixture the utile et dulce that the merchant and the
mechanic the peer the poet the prelate and the peasant are all
deeply concerned in its contents in truth a newspaper is so true a
mark the caprice englishmen that it may justly be styled their
coat arms the turkish koran is not near so sacred to a
rigid mahometan a parishdinner to an overseer a turtlefeast to an
alderman or an election to a freeholder as a gazette or newspaper to
an englishman by it the motions the world are watched and in some
degree governed the arts and sciences protected and promoted the
virtuous supported and stimulated the vicious reproved and
corrected and all informed
consequently said bob a good newspaper is really a valuable
article
doubtless continued tom and john bull mistake me not i don't
mean the paper which bears that title i mean the population england
enjoy a newspaper and there are some who could not relish their
breakfasts without one it is a sort general sauce to every thing
and to the quid nunc is indispensable for if one informs him a
naval armament he will not fail to toast the admirals all round in pint
bumpers to each wishes them success gets drunk with excessive loyalty
and goes with his head full seventyfours sixtyfours frigates
transports fireships c in its diversified pages persons every
rank denomination and pursuit may be informed the philosopher the
politician the citizen the handicraftsman and the gossip are regaled
by the novelty its contents the minuteness its details and the
refreshing arrivals transactions which occupy the attention human
beings at the greatest or nearest distances from usa
messenger grief
perhaps to thousands and joy to some
what is it but a map life
its fluctuations and its vast concerns
it may with propriety be compared to the planetary system the light
which it diffuses round the mental hemisphere operates according as
it is seen felt understood or enjoyed for instance the miser
is gladdened by an account the rise the stocks the mariner
is rejoiced at the safety his vessel after a thunderstorm the
manufacturer to hear the revival foreign markets the merchant
that his cargo is safely arrived the member that his election is
secured the father that his son is walling to return home the
poet that his production has been favourably received by the
public the physician that a difficult cure is transmitting his fame
to posterity the actor that his talents are duly appreciated the
agriculturist that grain fetches a good price the upright man that
his character is defended the poor man that beer meat bread and
vegetables are so within his reach that he can assure himself being
able to obtain a good sunday's dinner
tho they differ in carrie all alike just the same morning
chronicle times advertiser british press morning post news what
a host we read every day and grow wiser the examiner whig all alive
to the gig while each one his favourite chooses star traveller and
sun to keep up the fun and tell all the world what the news is
well done said bob you seem to have them all at your tongue's 
and their general contents in your head but for my part i am struck

a bitter pang the death a relative or hopeful lover it is as a

kept terms with mr l at oxford on her return she got acquainted
with a capt cr ks whom she contrived soon afterwards to lodge in
the next room to her husband in the bench but to whom she kindly gave
the preference in her visits
whether c l w lk s the linendraper or capt c k
be the most favoured swain or swine i venture not to say but the
former has devoted his time his chariot and his female acquaintances
boxes in public to her as a pledge his love she helped herself to
a loose picture great value belonging to him which very nearly fell
into the hands john doe or richard roe on her husband's account
afterwards the palm should however certainly be given to mr l 
as he courted her classically moralized to her sentimentally sung
psalms and prayed with her fervently and on all occasions treated her
like a lady
ha said a fashionably dressed young man who approached towards
dashall ha my dear fellow how goes it with you haven't seen
you this month d d unlucky circumstance wanted you very much
indeed glorious sport all jolly and bang up glad to hear
it said tom sorry you should have experienced any wants on my
account
which way are you going come along i'll tell you such a
spree regular and nothing but you must know a few days ago
sauntering down bondstreet i overtook sir g w ha my gay fellow
said he i thought you were at bury you're the very man i want my
brother jack has lost a rump and dozen to a young one and we want to
make up a select party a set real hardheaded fellows to share
the feast i have already recruited sir m m the buck parson lord
lavender and tom shuffled then there's yourself i hope my brother
and i the young one and a s deputy the reprobate curate whom
we will have to make fun we dine at halfpast seven at long's and
there will be some sport i assure you
i accepted the invitation and met the company before mentioned a
rump and dozen is always a nominal thing there was no rump except
lavender's which projects like a female's from the bottom a
tightlaced pair stays and as for the dozen i believe we drank
nearer three dozen different expensive wines which were tasted one
after the other with a quickness succession which at last left no
taste but a taste for more drink and for all sorts wickedness
this tasting plan is a very successful trick tavern keepers which
enables them to carry off half bottles wine to swell the reckoning
most amazingly and so to bewilder people as to the qualities the
wine that any thing provided it be strong and not acid will go down
at the heel the evening it is also a grand manoeuvre to intoxicate
a johnny raw and to astonish his weak mind with admiration for the
founder the feast therefore the old trick i have got some
particularly highflavoured burgundy which lord lavender very much
approved t'other day and might i sir ask your opinion a new
importation silvery or my lord have bought all the nabob's
east india madeira c was successfully practised
through the first course we were staghunting to a man and killed
the stag just as the second course came on the table this course was
occupied by a great number long shots sir m m and by lavender
offering to back himself and the buck parson against any other two
men in england as to the number head game which they would
bag from sunrise to sunset upon the moors a foot race and a dispute
as to the odds betted on the second october meeting occupied the
third course the desert was enlivened by a list ladies all
descriptions whose characters were cut up full as ably as the haunch 
venison was carved and here boasting success in love was as general
as the custom is base one man fashion goes by the name kiss and
tell
after an hour hard drinking as though it had been for a wager a
number very manly nice little innocent and instructive amusements
were resorted to we had a most excellent maggot race for a hundred and
then a handycap for a future poney race we had pitching a guinea into a
decanter at which the young one lost considerably we had a raffle
for a gold snuff box a challenge fifty against lord lavender's
dusseldorf pipe and five hundred betted upon the number shot to be
put into a joe wanton rifle we played at tetotum and the young
one leaped over a handkerchief six feet high for a wager he performed
extremely well at first but at last lavender who betted against him
kept plying him so with wine and daring him to an inch higher and
higher until at last the young one broke his nose and lost five
hundred guineas by his boyish diversion
now we had a fulminating letter introduced as a hoax upon shuffled
next devils and broiled bones then some blasphemous songs from the
curate who afterwards fell asleep and thus furnished an opportunity
for having his face blacked we then got in a band itinerant
musicians put crackers in their pockets cut off one fellow's tail and
had a milling match betwixt the baronet in the chair and the stoutest 
them who having had spirits wine poured over his head refused tolet
the candle be put to it
peace being restored a regular supper appeared and then a regular
setto at play where i perceived divers signals thrown out such as
rubbing foreheads and chins taking two pinches snuff and other
private telegraphic communications the result which was the young
one just age being greeted to a very great amount
we now sallied forth like a pack in full cry with all the loud
expression mirth and riot and proceeded to old which being
shut up we swore like troopers and broke the parlour windows in a
rage we next cut the traces a hackney coach and led the horses into
a mews where we tied them up coaches being asleep inside the whole
time we then proceeded to old hamadryed the bacon man's called
out fire and got the old man down to the door in his shirt when
lavender ran away with his nightcap and threw it into the water in
st james's square whilst the baronet put it in right and left at his
sconce and told him to hide his d d ugly masard this induced him
to come out and call the watch during which time the buck parson got
into his house and was very snug with the cook wench until the next
evening when old fusty mug went out upon business
after giving a view holloa we ran off with the charleys in full cry
after us when sir g w who had purposely provided himself with a long
cord gave me one and ran to the opposite side jermyn street
with the other in his hand holding it about two feet from the pavement
the old scouts came up in droves and we had em down in a moment for
every mother's son the guardians were caught in the trap and rolled
over each other slap into the kennel never was such a prime bit gig
they lay stunn'd with the fall broken lanterns staves rattles welsh
wigs nightcaps and old hats were scattered about in abundance while
grunting growling and swearing was heard in all directions one
old buck got his jawbone broken another staved in two his crazy
timbers that is to say broke a couple ribs a third bled from the
nose like a pig a fourth squinted admirably from a pair painted
peepers their numbers however increasing we divided our forces and
marched in opposite directions one party sallied along bond street
nailed up a snoosy charley in his box and bolted with his lantern the
others were not so fortunate for a s deputy cushion thumper the
young one and the baronet's brother got safely lodged in st james's
watchhouse
broad daylight now glar'd upon us lavender retired comfortably upon
madame la comtesse in the bench sir m m was found chanting cannons
with some wood nyml dirty ceaseless toil
bear market loads or grovelling weed the soil
some walk abroad a nuisance where they go
and snatch from infamy the bread woe
it is a strange sort infatuation this fashion said bob and it
is much to be regretted it should operate so much to the injury the
fair 
do you see that young man on the opposite side the wayinquired
dashallstopping him short in nankin breeches and jockeyboots
i do replied tallyhoho and pray who is he
the son a wealthy baronet who with an eye to the main chance in
early life engaged in some mercantile speculations which proving
productive concerns have elevated him to his present dignity beyond
which it is said he cannot go on account his having once kept a shop
this son is one what may be termed the ciphers society a sort
 useful article like an in arithmetic to denominate numbers
one those characters if character it may be termed which this
metropolis and its vicinity would furnish us with regiments indeed the
 it is related that a young lady haut ton in paris was observed
to have a tall fellow always following her wherever she went her
grandmother one day asked her what occasion there was for that man to be
always following her to which she replied i must blow my nose must
not i when i want this great genius was actually employed to carry
her pockethandkerchief general run fashionables are little
better than ciphers very necessary at times in the house commons
to suit the purposes and forward the intentions the ministers
by which they obtain titles to which they are not entitled and
transmit to posterity a race ennobled boobies what company what
society does not abound with ciphers and oftentimes in such plenty that
they are even serviceable to make the society considerable what could
we do to express on paper five hundred without the two ciphers or being
compelled to write eleven letters to explain what is equally well done
in three figures these ciphers are useful at general meetings upon
public questions though if they were all collected together in point
 intellectual value they would amount to nought they are equally
important as counters at a cardtable they tell for more than they are
worth among the city companies there are many them to be found and
the army is not deficient though great care is generally taken to send
the most conspicuous ciphers on foreign service public offices under
government swarm with them and how many round o's or ciphers may be
found among the gentlemen the long robe who as hudibras observes
never ope
their mouths but out there flies a trope
in the twelve judges it must be allowed there is no cipher because they
have two figures to support them but take these two figures away and
the whole wit mankind may be defied to patch up or recruit the number
without having recourse to the race ciphers
i have known a cipher make a profound statesman and a secretary nay
an ambassador but then it must be confess'd it has been by the timely
and prudent application proper supporters and it is certain that
ciphers have more than once shewn themselves significant in high posts
and stations and in more reigns than one bounteous nature indulges
mankind in a boundless variety characters as well as features and
has given ciphers to make up numbers and very often by such additions
renders the few much more significant and conspicuous the church has
its ciphers for a mitre looks as well on a round as on any letter in
the alphabet and the expense to the nation is equally the same
consequently john bull has no right to complain
see in compose a polite divine
more gay than grave not half so sound as fine
the ladies parson proudly skill'd is he
to tend their toilet and pour out their tea
foremost to lead the dance or patient sit
to deal the cards out or deal out small wit
then oh in public what a perfect beau
so powder'd and so trimm'd for pulpit show
so well equipp'd to tickle ears polite
with pretty little subjects short and trite
well cull'd and garbled from the good old store
 polish'd sermons often preached before
with precious scraps from moral shakespeare brought
to fill up awkward vacancies thought
or shew how he the orator can play
whene'er he meets with some good thing to say
or prove his taste correct his memory strong
nor let his fifteen minutes seem too long
his slumbering mind no knotty point pursues
save when contending for his tithes or dues
thus far although it must be allowed that ciphers are use it is not
every cipher that is truly useful there are ciphers indolence to
which some mistaken men give the title men fine parts there are
ciphers selfinterest to which others more wrongfully give the name
 patriots there are bacchanalian ciphers who will not leave the
bottle to save the nation but will continue to guzzle till no one
figure in arithmetic is sufficient to support them then there are
ciphers venus who will abandon all state affairs to follow a
cyprian even at the risk injuring a deserving wife military
ciphers who forsake the pursuit glory and distrustful their own
merit or courage affirm their distrust by a sedulous attendance at the
levees men power in short every man in my humble opinion is
no other than a cipher who does not apply his talents to the care his
morals and the benefit his country
you have been ciphering for some time said boh and i suppose you
have now finished your sum
i confess continued tom it has been a puzzling one for to make
something out nothing is impossible
not in all cases said bob
how so why you have proved it by your own shewing that these
nothings are to be made something 
i perceive replied tom that your acquaintance with sparkle is
not thrown away upon you and it argues well for if you are so ready
a pupil at imbibing his lessons you will soon become a proficient
in london manners and conversation but a cipher is like a round
robin it has neither beginning nor its centre is vacancy
its circle ambiguity and it stands for nothing unless in certain
connections
they were now proceeding gently along oxford street in pursuit their
way to soho square and met with little worthy note or remark until
they arrived near the newman street where a number workmen
were digging up the earth for the purpose making newdrains the
pathway was railed from the road by scaffolding poles strongly driven
into the ground and securely tied together to prevent interruption from
the passengers tom was remarking upon the hardihood and utility 
the labourers at the moment when a fountain water was issuing from
a broken pipe which arose as high as a two pair stairs window a
circumstance which quickly drew a number spectators around and
among the rest tom and his cousin could not resist an inclination to
spend a few minutes in viewing the proceedings
the irish gentlemen who made two or three ineffectual attempts to
stop the breach alternately got soused by the increased violence 
the water and at every attempt were saluted by the loud laughter the
surrounding multitude
to feelings naturally warm and irritable these vociferations 
amusement and delight at their defeat served but to exasperate and
enrage and the irishmen in strong terms expressed their indignation
at the merriment which their abortive attempts appeared to excite
at length one the paddies having cut a piece wood as he
conceived sufficient to stop the effusion water with some degree
 adroitness thrust his arm into the foaming fluid and for a moment
appeared to have arrested its progress
bloodanowns murphy cried he scoop away the water and be
after handing over the mallet this way in a moment the spades his
comrades were seen in
 round rubin a letter or billet so composed as to have
the signatures many persons in a circle in order that
the reader may not be able to discover which the party
signed first or last
action to accomplish his instructions while one who was not in a
humour to hear the taunts the crowd very politely scoop'd the water
with his hands among the spectators which created a general desire
to avoid his liberal and plentiful besprinkled and at the same time
considerable confusion among men women and children who in effecting
their escape were seen tumbling and rolling over each other in all
directions
be off wit you all and be d d to you said the hibernian while
those who were fortunate enough to escape the cooling fluid he was
so indifferently dispensing laughed heartily at their less favoured
companions
bob was for moving onward
hold said dash all it is two to one but you will see some fun
here
he had scarcely said the word when a brawny porter in a fustian jacket
with his knot slung across his shoulder manifested dislike to the
manner in which the irish gentleman was pursuing his amusement
d n your irish eyes said he don't throw your water here or
i'll lend you my bunch fives l
be after being off there replied pat and without hesitation
continued his employment
the porter was resolute and upon receiving an additional salute jumped
over the railings and resaluted poor pat with a muzzle which
drew his claret in a moment the irishman endeavoured to rally while
the crowd cheered the porter and hooted the labourer this was the
signal for hostilities the man who had plunged up the broken pipe let
go his hold and the fountain was playing away as briskly as ever all
was confusion and the neighbourhood in alarm the workmen with spades
and pickaxes gathered round their comrade and there was reason to
apprehend serious mischief would occur one them hit the porter with
his spade and several others were prepared to follow his example while
a second who seem'd a little more bloodthirsty than the rest raised
his pickaxe in a menacing attitude upon perceiving which dashall
jump'd over the rail and
 bunch fives a flash term for the fist frequently made
use among the lads the fancy who address each other
sometimes in a friendly way with ha bill how goes it
tip us your bunch fives my boy
 muzzle a blow on the mouth
arrested his arm or if the blow had been struck murder must
have ensued in the mean time several other persons following tom's
example had disarmed the remainder a fellowlabourer who had been
engaged at a short distance from the immediate scene action
attacked the man who had raised the pickaxe between whom a pugilistic
encounter took place the former swearing by jesus they were a set
 cowardly rascals and deserved quilting the water was flowing
copiously shovels pickaxes barrows lanterns and other implements
were strewed around them the crowd increased tom left the combatants
when he conceived no real danger unfair advantage being taken was to
be apprehended to enjoy their rolling in the mud while the porter
who had escaped the vengeance his opponents was explaining to
those around him and expostulating with the first aggressor upon
the impropriety his conduct the shouts the multitude at the
courageous proceedings the porter and the hooting at the shameful
and cowardly manner defence pursued by the labourers roused
the blood the irishmen and one again seized a spade to attack a
coalheaver who espoused the cause the porter a disposition was
again manifested to cut down any one who dared to entertain opinions
opposite to their own immediately a shower mud and stones was
directed towards him the spade was taken away and the irishmen armed
themselves in a similar way with the largest stones they could find
suitable for throwing in this state things the houses and the
windows in the neighbourhood were threatened with serious damage the
crowd retreated hallooing shouting hissing and groaning and in this
part the affray bob got himself well bespattered with mud tom again
interfered and after a few minutes persuaded the multitude to desist
and the irishmen to drop their weapons the porter made his escape and
the men resumed their work but upon dashall's return to the
 quilting to quilt a person among the knowing copies is
to give another a good thrashing probably this originated
in the idea warming as a quilt is a warm companion so a
setto is equally productive heat whether the allusion
holds good with respect to comfort must be left to the
decision those who try it on which is to make any
attempt or essay where success is doubtful
spot where he had left tallyhoho the latter was not to be found he
was however quickly relieved from suspense
sir said a stout man the neighbourhood is greatly indebted to
your exertions in suppressing a riot from which much mischief was to be
apprehended your friend is close at hand if you will step this way
you will find him he is getting his coat brushed at my house and has
sustained no injury
it is a lucky circumstance for him said tom and i think
myself fortunate upon the same account for i assure you i was
very apprehensive some serious mischief resulting from the
disturbance

as they entered the house a few doors up newman street tallyhoho met
them having divested himself the mud which had been thrown upon his
garments by the indiscriminating hand an enraged multitude and after
politely thanking the gentleman for his friendly accommodation they
were about to proceed to the place their original destination when
dashall perceiving an elegantly dressed lady on the opposite side 
the way felt instinctively as it were for the usual appendage a
modern fashionable the quizzingglass in the performance this he
was subjected to a double disappointment for his rencontre with the
hibernian had shivered the fragile ornament to atoms in his pocket
and before he could draw forth the useless fragments the more important
object his attention was beyond the power his visual orbs
it might have been worse said he as he survey'd the broken bauble
it is a loss which can easily be repaired and if in losing that
i have prevented more serious mischief there is at least some
consolation apropos here is the very place for supplying the defect
without loss time dixon continued he looking at
 this gentleman whose persevering endeavours in his
profession entitle him to the patronage the public
without pretending to second sight or the powers that are
so frequently attributed to the seventh son a seventh
son has thrown some new lights upon the world although he
does not pretend to make helps to read his establishment
at no newman her and pay no attention whatever to the
figure or steps but walk as deliberately as the music will admit not
dropping your little chit chat through the dance which is considered
undoubtedly very graceful and less like a mechanic or dancingmaster
the dance finished march into the bar and call for a glass 
blueruin whitetape or starknaked which is a very fashionable
liquor among the ton and if called on to pay for it tell the
landlord you have left your purse in one your blues at home and that
you will recollect it at the next ball this you know can be done ina
genteel way and you will be all the go return into the room and
either tread upon some gentleman's toes or give him a slight touch with
your elbow which if he be inclined to resent tell him pon honour
you did not observe him or if inclined to suffer it with impunity 
get out the way fellow d n you
on your way home after escorting your fair inamorata to her peaceful
abode make a few calls for the purpose taking a little more stimulus
with some particular friends and then return home for the night to
steep your senses in forgetfulness
a very amusing and useful account truly said bob as his cousin
closed his chapter instructions how to cut a dash
it is at least a just and true delineation living character
not without a good portion caricature said mincingait you
are downright scurrilous and ought not to be tolerated in civilized
society sink me if you are not quite a bore and not fit company
for a gentleman so i shall wish you a good morning
tom and bob laughed heartily at this declaration the dashing blade
and wishing him a pleasant walk and a safe return they separated
by this time they had arrived at somerset house it was near three
o'clock and the rooms exhibited a brilliant crowd rank and fashion
which considerably enhanced the value its other decorations
i have already said dashall given you a general description this
building and shall therefore confine my present observations wholly to
the establishment the royal academy for the encouragement the fine
arts for the cultivation which london is now much and deservedly
distinguished and to the progressive improvement in which we are
indebted to that exhibition we have already witnessed this academy
was opened by royal charter in and it consists forty members
called royal academicians twenty associates and six associate
engravers the first president was the justly celebrated sir joshua
reynolds the second the highly respected benjamin west and the
present is sir thomas lawrence
the academy possesses a fine collection casts and models from
antique statues c a school colouring from pictures the best
masters lectures are delivered by the stated professors in their
various branches to the students during the winter season prize
medals are given annually for the best academy figures and drawings
 buildings and gold medals for historical composition in painting
sculpture and designs in architecture once in two years which latter
are presented to the successful artists in full assembly accompanied
with a discourse from the president calculated to stimulate
perseverance and exertion students have at all times except during
the regular vacations an opportunity studying nature from well
chosen models and drawing from the antique casts
this exhibition is generally opened on the first may the number
 works art consisting paintings sculptures models proof
engravings and drawings generally exhibited are upwards one
thousand and are usually visited by all the gaiety and fashion the
metropolis between the hours two and five o'clock in the day
the rooms are elegant and spacious and i consider it at all times
a place where a shilling may be well spent and an hour or two well
enjoyed
some spend a life in classing grubs and try
new methods to impale a butterfly
or bottled up in spirits keep with care
a crowd reptiles hideously rare
while others search the mouldering wrecks time
and drag their stores from dust and rust and slime
coins eat with canker medals half defac'd
and broken tablets never to be trac'd
wormeaten trinkets worn away old
and broken pipkin form'd in antique mould
huge limbless statues busts heads forgot

on entering the rooms bob was bewildered with delight the elegance
 the company the number and excellence the paintings were
attractions so numerous and splendid as to leave him no opportunity
 decidedly fixing his attention he was surrounded by all that
could enchant the eye and enrapture the imagination moving groups 
interesting females were parading the rooms with dashing partners
at their elbows pointing out the most beautiful paintings from the
catalogues giving the names the artists or describing the subjects
seated on one the benches was to be seen the tired dandy whose
principal inducement to be present at this display the arts was to
exhibit his own pretty person and attract a little the public gaze
by his preposterous habiliments and unmeaning countenance to fasten
upon the first person who came within the sound his scarcely
articulate voice with observing it is d d hot pon honour can't
stand it very fatiguing i wonder so many persons are let in at
once there's no such thing as seeing i declare where there is such
a crowd i must come again that's the it on another was the
fulldressed elegant with her bonnet in one hand and her catalogue
in the other apparently intent upon examining the pictures before
her while in fact her grand aim was to discover whether she
herself was observed the lounging blood who had left his horses at
the door was bustling among the company with his quizzingglass in his
hand determined if possible to have a peep at every female he met
caring as much for the exhibition itself as the generality the
visitors cared for him the connoisseur was placing his eye occasionally
close to the paintings or removing to short distances right and left
to catch them in the most judicious lights and making remarks on his
catalogue with a pencil and mrs roundabout from leadenhall who had
brought her son dicky to see the show as she called it declared it was
the most finest sight she ever seed lifting up her hand and eyes at
the same time as dicky read over the list and charmed her by reciting
the various scraps poetry inserted in the catalogue to elucidate
the subjects it was altogether a source inexpressible delight and
amusement tom whose taste for the arts qualified him well for the
office guide upon such an occasion directed the eye his cousin
to the best and most masterly productions in the collection and
whose attention was more particularly drawn to the pictures though
occasionally devoted to the inspection a set wellformed features
or a delicately turned ancle was much pleased to find bob so busy in
enquiry and observation
we have here said tom a combination the finest specimens in the
art painting laid open annually for public inspection music poetry
and painting have always been held in high estimation by those who
mae speech was certainly a bold one and one
which the gentleman would have found some difficulty in
establishing if however the learned gentleman had
substituted the word law for blasphemy he would have been
much nearer the truth
 all the evils with which this country is afflicted that
 an excessive passion for law is the greatest the sum
paid annually in taxes is nothing to that which is spent in
litigation go into our courts justice and you will
often see sixty or seventy lawyers at a time follow them
home and you will find that they are residing in the
fashionable parts the town and living in the most
expensive manner look at the lists the two houses 
parliament and you will find lawyers predominate in the
house commons and in the upper house more peers who
owe their origin to the law than have sprung from the army
and navy united there is scarcely a street any
respectability without an attorney not to mention the
numbers that are congregated in the inns court in london
alone we are told there are nearly three thousand
certificated attornies and in the country they are numerous
in proportion
while on the subject lawyers we shall add a few
unconnected anecdotes which will exhibit the difference
between times past and present
in the rolls parliament for the year there is a
petition from two counties in england stating that the
number attornies had lately increased from sixteen to
twentyfour whereby the peace those counties had been
greatly interrupted by suits and it was prayed that it
might be ordained that there should only be six attornies
for the county norfolk the same number for suffolk and
two for the city norwich
the profits the law have also increased in proportion we
now frequently hear gentlemen at the bar making ten or
fifteen thousand pounds a year by their practice and a
solicitor in one single suit the trial warren hastings
is said to have gained no less than thirtyfive thousand
pounds how different three centuries ago when roper in
his life sir thomas more informs us that though he was
an advocate the greatest eminence and in full business
yet he did not by his profession make above four hundred
pounds per annum there is however a common tradition on
the other hand that sir edward coke's gains at the latter
 this century equalled those a modern attorney
general and by lord bacon's works it appears that he made
l per annum whilst in this office brownlow's profits
likewise one the promontories during the reign 
queen elizabeth were l per annum and he used to close
the profits the year with a laus ceo and when they
happened to be extraordinary maxima laus ceo 
there is no person we believe who is acquainted with the
important duties the judges or the laborious nature 
their office will think that they are too amply
remunerated and it is not a little remarkable that when
law and lawyers have increased so prodigiously the number
 the judges is still the same fortescue in the
dedication his work de claudius legum anglaise to prince
edward says that the judges were not accustomed to sit more
than three hours in a day that is from eight o'clock in
the morning until eleven they passed the remainder the
day in studying the laws and reading the holy scriptures
carte supposes that the great reason for the lawyers
pushing in shoals to become members parliament arose
from their desire to receive the wages then paid them by
their constituents by an act the th henry 
lawyers were excluded from parliament not from a contempt
 the common law itself but the professors it who at
this time being auditors to men property received an
annual stipend pro connie immense et impended and
were treated as retainers in maddox's form anglican there
is a form a retainer during his life john de thorp
as counsel to the earl westmoreland and it appears by
the household algerian fifth earl 
northumberland that in the beginning the reign henry
the eighth there was in that family a regular
establishment for two counsellors and their servants
a proclamation was issued on the th november in the
twentieth year the reign james i in which the voters
for members parliament are directed not to choose
curious and wrangling lawyers who may seek reputation by
stirring needless questions
a strong prejudice was at this time excited against lawyers
in aleyn's henry viii london we have the following
philippic against them
a prating lawyer one those which cloud
that honour'd science did their conduct take
he talk'd all law and the tumultuous crowd
thought it had been all gospel that he spake
at length these fools their common error saw
a lawyer on their side but not the law
pride the drayman used to say that it would never be well
till the lawyers gowns like the scottish colours were
hung up in westminster hall
from chaucer's character the temple manciple it would
appear that the great preferment which advocates in this
time chiefly aspired to was to become steward to some great
man he says 
 masters he had mo than thryis ten
that were law expert and curious
 which there were a dozen in that house
worthy to ben stuart house and lone
 any lord that is in england
been employed as clerks to pettifoggers who obtain permission to
sue in their names and persons who know no more law than what they
have learned in abbot's park or on board the fleet who assume
the title law agents or accountants and are admirably fitted for
agents in the insolvent debtor's court under the insolvent act to make
out schedules c being up to all the arts and manoeuvres practised with
success for the liberation themselves they are well calculated to
become tutors others though they generally take care to be well paid
for it
by this time they were entering the temple this continued tom
is an immense range buildings stretching from fleetstreet to
the river north and south and from lombardstreet whitefriars to
essexstreet in the strand east and west
it takes its name from its being founded by the knights templarss in
england the templarss were crusaders who about the year formed
themselves into a military body at jerusalem and guarded the roads
for the safety pilgrims in time the order became very powerful
the templarss in fleetstreet in the thirteenth century frequently
entertained the king the pope's nuncio foreign ambassadors and other
great personages
it is now divided into two societies students called the inner and
middle temple and having the name inns court
these societies consist benchers barristers students and members
the government is vested in the benchers in term time they dine in
the hall the society which is called keeping commons to dine a
fortnight in each term is deemed keeping the term and twelve these
terms qualify a student to be called to year henry the sixth when
sir walter beauchamp as counsel supported the claim precedence 
the earl warwick against the then earl marshal at the bar the
house lords mr roger hunt appeared in the same capacity for the
earl marshal and both advocates in their exordium made most humble
protestations entreating the lord against whom they were retained not
to take amiss what they should advance on the part their own client
another point on which the lawyers the present age differ from their
ancestors is in their prolixity it was reserved for modern invention
to make a trial for high treason last eight days or to extend a speech
to nine hours duration
 abbot's park the king's bench
 on board the fleet the fleet prison
these societies have the following officers and servants a
treasurer subtreasurer steward chief butler three underbutlers
upper and under cook a panniers a gardener two porters two
washpots and watchmen
the benchers assume and exercise a power that can scarcely be
reconciled to the reason the thing they examine students as to their
proficiency in the knowledge the law and call candidates to the bar
or reject them at pleasure and without appeal it is pretty well known
that students in some cases eat their way to the bar in which there can
be no great harm because their clients will take the liberty afterwards
 judging how far they have otherwise qualified themselves but every
man that eats in those societies should be called or the rejection
should be founded solely on his ignorance the law and should be
subject to an appeal to a higher jurisdiction otherwise the power 
the benchers may be exercised on private or party motives
the expence going through the course these societies is not
great in the inner temple a student pays on admission for the fees 
the society l s d which with other customary charges amounts to
l s a duty is also paid to the king which is high terms may be kept
for about s per week and in fact students may dine at a cheaper
rate here than any where beside the expences in the principal societies
 like nature are something more
their kitchens and dinnerrooms merit the inspection strangers
and may be seen on applying to the porter or cooks without fee or
introduction our time is short now or we would take a peep you must
therefore content yourself with my description
the temple is an irregular building in fleetstreet are two entrances
one to the inner and the other to the middle temple the latter has a
front in the manner indigo jones brick ornamented with four large
stone pilastres the ionic order with a pediment it is too narrow
and being lofty wants proportion the passage to which it leads
although designed for carriages is narrow inconvenient and mean
the garden the inner temple is not only a most happy situation but
is laid out with great taste and kept in perfect order it
is chiefly covered with green sward which is pleasing to the eye
especially in a city and is most agreeable to walk on it lies as you
perceive along the river is great extent and has a spacious
gravel walk or terrace on the bank the thames it forms a crowded
promenade in summer and at such times is an interesting spot
the middle temple has a garden but much smaller and not so
advantageously situated
the hall the middle temple is a spacious and elegant room in its
style many great feasts have been given in it in old times it is well
worth a visit
the inner temple hall is comparatively small but is a fine room it is
ornamented with the portraits several the judges before this
hall is a broad paved terrace forming an excellent promenade when the
gardens are not sufficiently dry
there are two good libraries belonging to these societies open to
students and to others on application to the librarian from ten in the
morning till one and in the afternoon from two till six
the temple church belongs in common to the two societies the knights
templarss built their church on this site which was destroyed and the
present edifice was erected by the knights hospitallers it is in the
norman style architecture and has three aisles running east and
west and two cross aisles at the western is a spacious round
tower the inside which forms an elegant and singular entrance into
the church from which it is not separated by close walls but merely by
arches the whole edifice within has an uncommon and noble aspect the
roof the church is supported by slight pillars sussex marble and
there are three windows at each side adorned with small pillars the
same marble the entire floor is flags black and white marble
the roof the tower is supported with six pillars having an upper and
lower range small arches except on the eastern side opening into
the church the length the church is eightythree feet the breadth
sixty and the height thirtyfour the height the inside the tower
is fortyeight feet and its diameter on the floor fiftyone
in the porch or tower are the tombs eleven knights templarss eight
 them have the figures armed knights on them three them
being the tombs so many earls pembroke the organ this church
is one the finest in the world
the temple church is open for divine service every day at eleven
o'clock in the morning and at four in the afternoon there are four
entrances into the temple besides those in fleetstreet and it is
a thoroughfare during the day but the gates are shut at night the
gardens are open to the public in summer it is a place much business
and constant traffic i assure you
i perceive it said bob by the number persons passing and
repassing every one apparently animated and impelled by some business
 importance
yes it is something like a steamboiler by which a considerable
portion the engines the law are kept in motion they can alarm and
allay according to the pockets their customers or the sagacity which
they are able to discover in their heads there are perhaps as many
quacks in this profession as in any other continued tom as they
regained fleetstreet when perceiving it was half past four o'clock by
st dunstan's but we must now make the best our way or we may be
cut out the good things this globe 
what are so many persons collected together here for enquired bob
merely to witness a little ingenious machinery keep your eye on the
two figures in the front the church with clubs in their hands
i do said bob but there does not appear to me to be any thing very
remarkable about them
he scarcely uttered the words when he observed that these figures
struck their clubs upon the bells which hung between them to denote the
time day
these figures said tom and the circumstance giving them motion
every fifteen minutes by the movements the clock have attracted a
great deal notice particularly among persons from the country and
at almost every quarter an hour throughout the day they are honoured
with spectators the church itself is very ancient and has been
recently beautified the bell thunders whose abilities you have just
had a specimen have been standing there ever since the year 
it is hard service said bob and they must certainly deserve a
pension from government more than many the automatons who are
now in the enjoyment the national bounties
you are right enough said a translator soles who had overheard
bob's last remark with a pair old shoes under his arm and d n
me if i would give a pair crazy crab shells without vamp or
wheat for the whole boiling em there is not one on em worth a
bloody jemmy
upon hearing this from the political cobbler a disturbed sort shout
was uttered by the surrounding spectators who had rather increased than
diminished in number to hear the observations the leathernlonged
orator when tom giving his cousin a significant pinch the arm
impelled him forward and left them to the enjoyment their humour
political observations are always bad in the street said tom it is
a subject upon which scarcely any two persons agree distinctly old wax
and bristles is about three sheets in the wind and no doubt there
are enough to take advantage any persons stopping at this time the
day
what have we here said bob who observed a concourse people
surrounding the fetter lane
only a couple more striking figures replied tom almost as
intelligent as those we have just seen
 translator soles a disciple st crispin alias a
cobbler who can botch up old shoes so as to have the
appearance being almost new and who is principally
engaged in his laudable occupation by the secondhand booksellers
 field lane turn stile c for the purpose 
turning an honest penny ie to deceive poor purchasers
 crabshells a cant term for shoes
 whole boding em the whole kit em c means the
whole party
 bloody jemmy a cant term for a sheep's head
 three sheets in the wind a cant phrase intending to
explain that a person is more than half drunk
 this was a hint well given by dashall for in the present
times it is scarcely possible to be aware the numerous
depredations that are committed in the streets the
metropolis in open daylight and it is a wellknown fact
that fleet street being one the leading thoroughfares
is at almost all times infested with loose characters 
every description from the welldressed sharpers who hover
round the entrances to billiardtables to mark new comers
and give information to the pals in waiting somewhere
within call and who are called macesto the wily duffers
or buffers willing to sell extraordinary bargains and the
clyfaker or pickpocket
bob bustled forward and looking down the lane perceived two
watchmen one on each side the street bearing poles with black boards
inscribed in white letters beware bad houses and a lantern
hanging to each
these said tom are not decoy ducks but scare crows at least they
are intended for such whether their appearance does not operate as much
one way as it does the other is i believe a matter doubt
beware bad houses said bob i don't exactly see the object
no perhaps not continued his cousin but i will tell you this is a
method which the churchwardens parishes sometimes take shaming
the papa or fie fie ladies from their residences or at least 
discovering their visitors but i am half inclined to think that nine
times out ten the contrary effect is produced for these men who are
stationed as warnings to avoid are easily to be blinded by the gay and
gallant youths who have an inclination to obtain an admission to
the fair cyprians besides which if the first inhabitants are really
induced to quit the house is quickly occupied by similar game and
the circumstance the burning out as it is termed serves as a
directionpost to new visitors so that no real good is eventually
effectedcome we had better move on there is nothing more
extraordinary here
this is peele's coffee house continued he a house celebrated for
its general good accommodations here as well as at the chapter coffee
house in paternoster row all the newspapers are kept filed annually
and may be referred to by application to the waiters at the very
trifling expense a cup coffee or a glass wine the monthly
and quarterly reviews and the provincial papers are also kept for the
accommodation the customers and constitute an extensive and valuable
library it is the frequent resort authors and critics who meet to
pore over the news the day or search the records past times
an excellent way passing an hour said bob and a proof the
studied attention which is paid not only to the comforts and convenience
 their customers but also to their instruction
you are right replied tom in london every man has an opportunity
 living according to his wishes and the powers his pocket
he may dive like frederick random into a cellar and fill his belly for
four pence or regale himself with the more exquisite delicacies the
london tavern at a guinea while the moderate tradesman can be supplied
at a chophouse for a couple shillings and the mechanic by a call at
the shop over the way at the corner water lane may purchase his
half pound ham or beef and retire to a publichouse to eat it where
he obtains his pint porter and in turn has an opportunity reading
the morning advertiser the times or the chronicle up this court
is a wellknown house the sign the old cheshire cheese it has long
been established as a chophouse and provides daily for a considerable
number persons but similar accommodations are to be found in almost
every street in london then again there are cookshops a still
humbler description where a dinner may be procured at a still more
moderate price so that in this great metropolis there is accommodation
for all ranks and descriptions persons who may be served according
to the delicacy their appetites and the state their finances
a chophouse is productive all the pleasures in life it is a
combination the most agreeable and satisfactory amusements indeed
those who have never had an opportunity experiencing the true
happiness therein to be found have a large portion delight and
gratification to discover the heart the mind and the constitution
are to be mended upon crossing its threshold and description must
fall short in its efforts to pourtray its enlivening and invigorating
influence it is in a word a little world within itself absolutely
a universe in miniature possessing a system peculiar to itself 
planets and satellites
 this allusion was made by the hon tom dashall to the shop
 mr cantus who was formerly in the employ mr expand
whose appearance in opposition to him at temple bar a
few years back excited a great deal public attention and
had the effect reducing the prices their ham and beef
mr epps generally has from fourteen to twenty shops and
sometimes more situated in different parts the
metropolis and there is scarcely a street in london where
there is not some similar place accommodation but mr
epps is the most extensive purveyor for the public appetite
at these shops families may be supplied with any quantity
from an ounce to a pound hot boiled beef and ham at
moderate prices while the poor are regaled with a plate 
cuttings at a penny or twopence each
and fixed stars and revolutions and its motions are annual rotatory
and diurnal in all its extensive diversity waiters cooks
saucepans frying pans gridirons salamanders stoves and smokejacks
so that if you wish to know true and enclosing delight you are now
acquainted with where it is to be found not all the sages the
ancient or the modern world ever dreamed a theory half so exquisite
or calculated to afford man a treat so truly delicious
within the doors a chophouse are to be found food for both body
and soulmortal and mental appetitesfeasting for corporeal cravings and
cravings intellectualnourishment at once for the faculties both mind
and body there in fact the brain may be invigorated and the mind fed
with good things while the palate is satisfied by devouring a mutton
chop a veal cutlet or a beef steak and huge draughts wisdom may be
imbibed while drinking a bottle soda or a pint humble porter
in this delightful place amusement and convenience there is
provender for philosophers or fools stoics or epicurean contemplation
for genius all denominations and it embraces every species 
science and art having an especial eye to the important art 
cookery it encompasses all that is worthy the sublimest faculties
and capacities the soul it is the resort all that is truly good
and glorious on earth the needy and the noble the wealthy and the
wise its high estimation is universally acknowledged it has the
suffrage the whole world so much so that at all times and in all
seasons its supremacy is admitted and its influence recognized the
name the very name alone is sufficient to excite all that is
pleasant to our senses five or seven how many soever there may be a
chophouse at that word what delightful prospects are presented to the
mind's eyewhat a clashing knives and forks and plates and pewter
pots and rushing footsteps and murmuring expectant hosts enter
into our delighted ears what gay scenes varied beauty and many
natured viands and viscous soups tarts puddings and pies rise before
our visual nerveswhat fragrant perfumes sweet scented odours

effects will produce a radical advantageits component parts go down
with the world and are well digested
your description said bob has already had the effect awakening
appetite and i feel almost as hungry as if i were just returning from a
foxchace
then continued the hon tom dashall it is not only admirable asa
whole its constituent and individual beauties are as provocative 
respect as the mass is our veneration from among its innumerable
excellencies i will mention one which deserves to be held in
recollection and kept in our contemplationwhat is more delightful
than a fine beefsteakspite lexicographers there is something
 harmony even in its name it seems to be the keynote our best
constructed organs organs differing from all others only because they
have no stops it circles all that is full rich and sonorous i do
not mean in its articulated enunciation but in its internal
acceptation there there we feel all its strength and diapas or force
and quantity
admirable arrangements indeed said bob true continued

daffy's
daffy's said tallyhothat is somewhat new to me i don't recollect
hearing it before
daffy's elixir replied dashall was a celebrated quack medicine
formerly sold by a celebrated doctor that name and recommended by
him as a cure for all diseases incident to the human frame this gin
old tom and blue ruin are equally recommended in the present day inconsequence
 which some the learned gentlemen the sporting
world have given it the title daffy's though this excellent beverage
is known by many other names
for instance the lady refined sentiments and delicate nerves feels
the necessity a little cordial refreshment to brighten the one and
enliven the other and therefore takes it on the sly under the polite
appellation white wine the knowing kids and dashing swells are fora

disdains to be termed a dry washer dearly loves a dollop old

by this time they were at the globe upon entering which they were
greeted by mortimer and merry well who had arrived before them and
dinner being served almost immediately they were as quickly seated at
the table to partake an excellent repast
 it is a wellknown fact that a person the name 
tiffin announced himself to the world under this very
seductive title which doubtless had the effect 
bringing him considerable custom from the loyal subjects

chapter xvii
here fashion and folly still go hand in hand
with the blades the east and the bucks the strand
the bloods the park and paraders so gay
who are lounging in bond street the most the day
who are foremost in all that is formed for delight
at greeting or wenching or drinking all night
for london is circled with unceasing joys
then east west north and south let us hunt them my boys
 the entrance to the house had attracted tallyhoho's admiration as
they proceeded but the taste and elegance the coffeeroom fitted up
with brilliant chandeliers and presenting amidst a blaze splendour
every comfort and accommodation for its visitors struck him with
surprise in which however he was not suffered to remain long for
merrywell and mortimer had laid their plans with some degree depth
and determination to carry into execution the proposed ramble the
evening and had ordered a private room for the party besides which
they had invited a friend to join them who was introduced to tom and
bob under the title frank harry frank harry was a humorous sort 
fellow who could tell a tough story sing a merry song and was up to
snuff though he frequently got snuffy singing
the bottle's the sun our table
his beams are rosy wine
we planets never are able
without his beams to shine
let mirth and glee abound
you'll soon grow bright
with borrow'd light
and shine as he goes round
he was also a bit a dabbler at poetry a writer songs epigrams
epitaphs c and having been a long resident in the east was thought
to be a very useful guide on such an excursion and proved himself a
very pleasant sort companion he had a dawning pleasantry
in his countenance eradicated by an eye vivacity which seemed to
indicate there was nothing which gave him so much gratification as a
mirthmoving jest
what spirits were his what wit and what whim now cracking a joke and
now breaking a limb
give him but food for laughter and he would almost consider himself
furnished with food and raiment there was however a pedantic manner
with him at times an affectation the clerical in his dress which
upon the whole did not appear to be the newest fashion or improved
by wearing yet he would not barter one wakeful jest for a hundred
sleepy sermons or one laugh for a thousand sighs if he ever sigh'd at
all it was because he had been serious where he might have laugh'd
if he had ever wept it was because mankind had not laugh'd more and
mourn'd less he appeared almost to be made up contrarieties turning
at times the most serious subjects into ridicule and moralizing upon
the most ludicrous occurrences life never failing to conclude his
observations with some quaint or witty sentiment to excite risibility
seeming at the same time to say
how i love to laugh
never was a weeper
care's a silly calf
joy's my casket keeper
during dinner time he kept the table in a roar laughter by declaring
it was his opinion there was a kind puppyism in pigs that they
should wear tails calling a great coat a spencer folio edition with
tailpieces hercules a manmidwife in a small way business because
he had but twelve labours assured them he had seen a woman that morning
who had swallowed an almanac which he explained by adding that her
features were so carbuncled that the red lettered days were visible on
her face that horace ran away from the battle philippi merely to
prove that he was no lame poet he described critics as the doorporters
to the temple fame whose business was to see that no persons slipped
in with holes in their stockings or paste buckles for diamond ones but
was much in doubt whether they always performed their duty honestly he
called the sun the yellowhair'd laddie and the prince 
darkness the black prince ask'd what was the difference between a
sighheaver and a coalheaver but obtaining no answer i will tell you
said he the coalheaver has a load at his back which he can carry buta
sighheaver has one at his heart which he can not carry he had a
whimsical knack quoting old proverbs and instead saying the
cobbler should stick to his last he conceived it ought to be the
cobbler should stick to his wax because he thought that the more
practicable what is bred in the bone said he will not come out with
the skewer and justified his alteration by asserting it must be plain
enough to the fatheaded comprehension those epicurean persons who
have the magpiepropensity prying into marrowbones
dashall having remarked in the course conversation that necessity
has no law 
he declared he was sorry for it it was surely a pity considering
the number learned clerks she might give employ to if she had her
chancellor continued he would have no sinecure it i judge hearing
the petitions her poor brokenfortuned and bankrupt subjects would
take up all his terms though every term were a year and every year
a term thus he united humour with seriousness and seriousness with
humour to the infinite amusement those around him
merrywell who was well acquainted with and knew his humour took
every opportunity what is called drawing him out and encouraging
his propensity to punning a species wit at which he was particularly
happy for puns fell as thick from him as leaves from autumn bowers and
he further entertained them with an account the intention he had some
short time back petitioning for the office punpurveyor to his
late majesty but that before he could write the last line and your
petitioner will ever pun it was bestowed upon a yeoman the guard
still however said he i have an idea opening business as a
punwright in general to his majesty's subjects for the sale and
diffusion all that is valuable in that small ware wit and
intend to advertise puns upon all subjects wholesale retail and for
exportation n b an allowance will be made to captains and gentlemen
going to the east and west indies hooks peaks pococks supplied

 wellknown dramatic authors

deal box price five acts sterling comedy per packet or in small
quantities in courtplaster sized boxes price one melodrama and

munden grin all others are counterfeits long live apollo c c
the cloth being removed the wine was introduced and
as wine whets the wit improves its native force
and gives a pleasant flavour to discourse
frank harry became more lively at each glass egad said he my
intention petitioning to be the king's punster puts me in mind a
story
can't you sing it enquired merrywell
the pipes want clearing out first was the reply and that is a sign
i can't sing at present but signal as it may appear and i see some
telegraphic motions are exchanging my intention is to shew to you all
the doubtful interpretation signs in general
let's have it then said tom but mr chairman i remember an old
song which concludes with this sentiment
tis hell upon earth to be wanting wine
the bottle is out we must replenish
the hint was no sooner given than the defect was remedied and after
another glass
king james on his arrival in london said he was waited on by
a spanish ambassador a man some erudition but who had strangely
incorporated with his learning a whimsical notion that every country
ought to have a school in which a certain order men should be taught
to interpret signs and that the most expert in this department ought
to be dignified with the title professor signs if this plan were
adopted he contended that most the difficulties arising from the
ambiguity language and the imperfect acquaintance which people 
one nation had with the tongue another would be done away signs he
argued arose from the dictates nature and as they were the same
in every country there could be no danger their being misunderstood
full this project the ambassador was lamenting one day before
the king that the nations europe were wholly destitute this grand
desideratum and he strongly recommended the establishment a college
founded upon the simple principles he had suggested the king either
to humour this quixotic foible or to gratify his own ambition at the
expense truth observed in reply why sir i have a professor
 signs in one the northernmost colleges in my dominions but
the distance is perhaps six hundred miles so that it will be
impracticable for you to have an interview with him pleased with this
unexpected information the ambassador exclaimed if it had been six
hundred leagues i would go to see him and i am determined to set out
in the course three or four days the king who now perceived that
he had committed himself endeavoured to divert him from his purpose
but finding this impossible he immediately caused letters to be
written to the college stating the case as it really stood and desired
the professors to get rid the ambassador in the best manner they were
able without exposing their sovereign disconcerted at this strange and
unexpected message the professors scarcely knew how to proceed they
however at length thought to put off their august visitant by saying
that the professor signs was not at home and that his return
would be very uncertain having thus fabricated the story they made
preparations to receive the illustrious stranger who keeping his word
in due time reached their abode on his arrival being introduced with
becoming solemnity he began to enquire who among them had the honour
 being professor signs he was told in reply that neither 
them had that exalted honour but the learned gentleman after whom
he enquired was gone into the highlands that they conceived his stay
would be considerable but that no one among them could even conjecture
the period his return i will wait his coming replied the
ambassador if it be twelve months
finding him thus determined and fearing from the journey he had
already undertaken that he might be as good as his word the learned
professors had recourse to another stratagem to this they found
themselves driven by the apprehension that they must entertain him as
long as he chose to tarry and in case he should unfortunately weary out
their patience the whole affair must terminate in a discovery 
the fraud they knew a butcher who had been in the habit serving the
colleges occasionally with meat this man they thought with a little
instruction might serve their purpose he was however blind with one
eye but he had much drollery and impudence about him and very well
knew how to conduct any farce to which his abilities were competent
on sending for geordy for that was the butcher's name they
communicated to him the tale and instructing him in the part he was to
act he readily undertook to become professor signs especially as he
was not to speak one word in the ambassador's presence on any pretence
whatever having made these arrangements it was formally announced to
the ambassador that the professor would be in town in the course 
a few days when he might expect a silent interview pleased with
this information the learned foreigner thought that he would put his
abilities at once to the test by introducing into his dumb language
some subject that should be at once difficult interesting and
important when the day interview arrived geordy was cleaned up
decorated with a large bushy wig and covered over with a singular gown
in every respect becoming his station he was then seated in a chair
 state in one their large rooms while the ambassador and the
trembling professors waited in an adjoining apartment
it was at length announced that the learned professor signs was
ready to receive his excellency who on entering the room was struck
with astonishment at his venerable and dignified appearance as none 
the professors would presume to enter to witness the interview under
a pretence delicacy but in reality for fear that their presence
might have some effect upon the risible muscles geordy's countenance
they waited with inconceivable anxiety the result this strange
adventure upon which depended their own credit that the king and
in some degree the honour the nation
as this was an interview signs the ambassador began with geordy
by holding up one his fingers geordy replied by holding up two the
ambassador then held up three geordy answered by clenching his fist
and looking sternly the ambassador then took an orange from his pocket
and held it up geordy returned the compliment by taking from his
pocket a piece a barley cake which he exhibited in a similar
manner the ambassador satisfied with the vast attainments the
learned professor then bowed before him with profound reverence and
retired on rejoining the agitated professors they fearfully began to
enquire what his excellency thought their learned brother he is
a perfect miracle replied the ambassador his worth is not to be
purchased by the wealth half the indies may we presume to descend
to particulars returned the professors who now began to think
themselves somewhat out danger gentlemen said the ambassador
when i first entered into his presence i held up one finger to denote
that there is one god he then held up two signifying that the father
should not be divided from the son i then held up three intimating
that i believed in father son and holy ghost he then clenched his
fist and looking sternly at me signified that these three are
one and that he would defy me either to separate them or to make
additions i then took out an orange from my pocket and held it up to
show the goodness god and to signify that he gives to his creatures
not only the necessaries but even the luxuries life then to my
utter astonishment this wonderful man took from his pocket a piece 
bread thus assuring me that this was the staff life and was to be
preferred to all the luxuries in the world being thus satisfied with
his proficiency and great attainments in this science i silently
withdrew to reflect upon what i had witnessed diverted with the
success their stratagem the professors continued to entertain their
visitor until he thought prudent to withdraw no sooner had he retired
than the opportunity was seized to learn from geordy in what manner he
had proceeded to give the ambassador such wonderful satisfaction they
being at a loss to conceive how he could have caught his ideas with
so much promptitude and have replied to them with proportionable
readiness but that one story might not borrow any features from
the other they concealed from geordy all they had learned from the
ambassador and desiring him to begin with his relation he proceeded in
the following manner when the rascal came into the room after gazing
at me a little what do you think gentlemen that he did he held up
one finger as much as to say you have only one eye i then held up
two to let him know that my one eye was as good as both 
his he then held up three as much as to say we have only three eyes
between us this was so provoking that i bent my fist at the scoundrel
and had it not been for your sakes i should certainly have risen from
the chair pulled off my wig and gown and taught him how to insult a
man because he had the misfortune lass
brisk let the bottle circulate
name quickly name each one his fav'rite lass
drive from your brows the clouds fate
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
come thou grapeencircled boy
from thy blissful seats above
crown the present hours with joy
bring me wine and bring me love
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
bacchus o'er my yielding lip
spread the produce thy vine
love thy arrows gently dip
temp'ring them with generous wine
fill the sparkling bumper high
let us drain the bottom dry
in the mean time the enemy life was making rapid strides upon them
unheeded till dashall reminded merrywell their intended visit to
the east and that as he expected a large portion amusement in that
quarter he proposed a move
they were by this time all well primed ripe for a rumpus bangup for a
lark or spree any where any how or with any body they therefore took
leave their present scene gaiety
chapter xviii
wand'ring with listless gait and spirits gay
they eastward next pursued their jocund way
with story joke smart repartee and pun
their business pleasure and their object fun
it was a fine moonlight evening and upon leaving the globe they again
found themselves in the hurry bustle and noise the world the glare
 the gaslights and the rattling coaches carts and vehicles 
variousdescriptions mingled with
the busy hum men
attracted the attention their eyes and ears while the exhilarating
juice the bottle had given a circulation to the blood which
enlivened imagination and invigorated fancy bob conceived himself in
elysium and frank harry was as frisky as a kitten the first object
that arrested their progress was the house mr hone whose political
parodies and whose trials on their account have given him so much
celebrity his window at the moment exhibited his recent satirical
publication entitled a slap at slop and the bridge street gang
 the great wit and humour displayed in this publication
have deservedly entitled it to rank high among the jeu
esprit productions this lively age to describe it were
impossible to enjoy it must be to possess it but for the
information such our readers as are remote from the
metropolis it may perhaps be necessary to give something
like a key explanation to its title a certain learned
gentleman formerly the editor the times said now to bethe
conductor the new times who has by his writings
rendered himself obnoxious to a numerous class readers
has been long known by the title dr slop in his
publication denominated the mock times and the slop pail
he has been strenuous in his endeavours to support and
uphold a society said to miscall themselves the
constitutional society but now denominated the bridge
street gang and the publication alluded to contains
humorous and satirical parodies and sketches the usual
contents his slop pail with a life the learned
doctor and an account the origin the gang
 here said tom we are introduced at once into a fine field
 observation the inhabitant this house defended himself in three
different trials for the publication alleged impious profane and
scandalous libels on the catechism the litany and the creed st
athanasius with a boldness intrepidity and perseverance almost
unparalleled as they followed in immediate succession without even an
allowance time for bodily rest or mental refreshment
yes continued frank harry and gained a verdict on each occasion
notwithstanding the combined efforts men in power and those whose
constant practice in our courts law with learning and information at
their fingers ends rendered his enemies fearful antagonists
it was a noble struggle said tallyhoho i remember we had accounts
 it in the country and we did not fail to express our opinions by
subscriptions to remunerate the dauntless defender the rights and
privileges the british subject
tip us your flipper said harrythen i see you are a true bit
 the bull breed one us as i may say well now you see the spot
 earth he inhabits zounds man in his shop you will find amusement
for a month see here is the house that jack built there is the queen's
matrimonial ladder do you mark what think you these qualifications
for a gentleman
in love and in liquor and overtopped with debt with women with
wine and with duns on the fret
there you have the nondescript
a something a nothing what none understand
bemitred becrowned but without heart or hand
there's jack in the green too and noodles alas
who doodle john bull gold silver and brass
come said dashall you must cut your story short i know if you
begin to preach we shall have a sermon as long as from here to south
america so allons and with this impelling his cousin forward they
 tip us your flipper your manley your saddle or your
thieving hook are terms made use as occasions may suit
the company in which they are introduced to signify a desire
to shake hands
 approached towards saint paul's chiefly occupied in conversation
on the great merit displayed in the excellent designs mr cruikshank
which embellish the work they had just been viewing nor did they
discover any thing further worthy notice till bob's ears were
suddenly attracted by a noise somewhat like that a rattle and
turning sharply round to discover from whence it came was amused with
the sight several small busts great men apparently dancing to the
music a weaver's shuttle
what the devil do you call this said he is it an exhibition 
waxwork or a model academy
neither replied dashall this is no other than the shop a
wellknown dealer in stockings and nightcaps who takes this ingenious
mode making himself popular and informing the passengers that
here you may be served with all patterns and sizes
from the foot to the head at moderate prices
with woolens for winter and cottons for summer let us move on for
there generally is a crowd at the door and there is little doubt but he
profits by those who are induced to gaze as most people do in london
if they can but entrap attention romans is one those gentlemen who
has contrived to make some noise in the world by puffing advertisements
and the circulation poetical handbills he formerly kept a very small
shop for the sale hosiery nearly opposite the eastindia house where
he supplied the sailors after receiving their pay for a long voyage as
well as their doxies with the articles in which he deals by obtaining
permission to style himself hosier to the rt hon east india company
since which finding his trade increase and his purse extended he has
extended his patriotic views clothing the whole population london
by opening shops in various parts and has at almost all times two or
three depositories for
 romans the eccentric hosier generally places a loom near the door
 his shops decorated with small busts some which being attached
to the upper movements the machinery and grotesquely attired in
patchwork and feathers bend backwards and forwards with the motion 
the works apparently to salute the spectators and present to the idea
persons dancing while every passing the shuttle produces a noise
which may be assimilated to that the rattlesnake accompanied with
sounds something like those a dancingmaster beating time to his
scholars his stock at this moment besides what we have just
seen there is one in gracechurch street and another in shoreditch
where the passengers are constantly assailed by a little boy who stands
at the door with some bills in his hand vociferating cheap cheap
then said bob wherever he resides i suppose may really be called
cheapside
with quite as much propriety continued ton as the place we are now
in for as the irishman says in his song
at a place called cheapside they sell every thing dear
during this conversation mortimer merrywell and harry were amusing
themselves by occasionally addressing the numerous ladies who were
passing and taking a peep at the shops giggling with girls or
admiring the taste and elegance displayed in the sale fashionable and
useful articles rustled and impeded every now and then by the throng
approaching bow church they made a dead stop for a moment
what a beautiful steeple exclaimed bob i should though no
architect prefer this to any i have yet seen in london
your remark replied dashall does credit to your taste it is
considered the finest in the metropolis st paul's displays the grand
effort sir christopher wren but there are many other fine specimens
 his genius to be seen in the city his latin epitaph in st paul's
may be translated thus if you seek his monument look around you and
we may say this steeple if you wish a pillar to his fame lookup
the interior the little church walbrook st stephen's is
likewise considered a
 this church is perhaps unrivalled for the beauty the
architecture its interior for harmony proportion
grace airiness variety and elegance it is not to be
surpassed it is a small church built in the form a
cross the roof is supported by corinthian columns so
disposed as to raise an idea grandeur which the
dimensions the structure do not seem to promise over the
centre at which the principal aisles cross is a dome
divided into compartments the roof being partitioned in a
similar manner and the whole finely decorated the effect
 this buildking is inexpressibly delightful the eye atone
glance embracing a plan full and distinct and
afterwards are seen a greater number parts than the
spectator was prepared to expect it is known and admired on
the continent as a masterpiece art over the altar is a
fine painting the martyrdom st stephen by west
 chef louvre the same artist and serves to display the
versatility his genius
instead however looking up bob was looking over the way where a
number people collected round a bookseller's window had attracted
his attention
apropos cried dashall the temple apollo we should have
overlook'd a fine subject but for your remark yonder is egg's evening
 auction let us cross and see what's going on he is a fellow 
infinite mirth and good humour and many an evening have i passed at
his auction better amused than by a farce at the theatre
they now attempted to cross but the intervening crowd carriages
three or four deep and in a line as far as the eye could reach for the
present opposed an obstacle
if i could think it said sparkle i'd give you the ode on his
birthday which i once saw in ms it is the jeu esprit a very
clever young poet and who perhaps one these days may be better
known but poets like anatomical subjects are worth but little till
dead
and for this reason i suppose says tom their friends and patrons
are anxious they should rather be starved than die a natural death
oh now i have it let us remain in the churchyard a few minutes
while the carriages pass and you shall hear it
ye hackneycoaches and ye carts
that oft so well perform your parts
for those who choose to ride
now louder let your music grow
your heated axles fiery glow
whether you travel quick or shown
cheapside
for know ye ragged rascals all
as h would in his pulpit bawl
with cheeks extended wide
know as you pass the crowded way
this is the happy natal day
 him whose books demand your stay
in cheapside
twas on the bright propitious morn
when the facetious tegcy was born
 mirth and fun the pride
that nature said good fortune follow
bear him thro life o'er hill and hollow
give him the temple apollo
in cheapside
then o ye sons literature
shew your regard for mother nature
nor let her be denied
hail hail the man whose happy birth
may tell the world mental worth
they'll find the best books on the earth
in cheapside
good exclaimed bob but we will now endeavour to make our way
across and take a peep at the subject the ode
finding the auction had not yet commenced sparkle proposed adjourning
to the burton coffee house in the adjacent passage taking a nip ale
by way refreshment and exhilaration and returning in half an hour
this proposition was cordially agreed to by all except tallyhoho whose
attention was engrossed by a large collection caricatures which
lay exposed in a portfolio on the table beneath the rostrum the
irresistible broad humour the subjects had taken fast hold his
risible muscles and in turning them over one after the other he found
it difficult to part with such a rich fund humour and still more so
to stifle the violent emotion it excited at length clapping his hands
to his sides he gave full vent to the impulse in a horselaugh from a
pair truly stentorian lungs and was by main force dragged out by his
companions
while seated in the comfortable enjoyment their nips ale sparkle
with his usual vivacity began an elucidation the subjects they
had just left the collection caricatures said he which is
considered the largest in london are mostly from the pencil that
selftaught artist the late george woodward and display not only a
genuine and original style humour in the design but a corresponding
and appropriate character in the dialogue or speeches connected with
the figures like his contemporary in another branch the art george
norland he possessed all the eccentricity and thoughtless improvidence
so common and frequently so fatal to genius and had not his good
fortune led him towards bow church he must have suffered severe
privations and perhaps eventually have perished want here he
always found a ready market and a liberal price for his productions
however rude or hasty the sketch or whatever might be the subject 
them
 as to books continued he all ages classes and appetites
may be here suited the superficial dabbler in and pretender to everything
will find collections selections beauties flowers gems c
the man real knowledge may here purchase the elements theory
and practice every art and science in all the various forms and
dimensions from a single volume to the encyclopedia at large
the dandy may meet with plenty pretty little foolscap volumes
delightfully hotpressed and exquisitely embellished the contents 
which will neither fatigue by the quantity nor require the laborious
effort thought to comprehend the jolly bonvivant and bacchanal
will find abundance the latest songs toasts and sentiments and the
wouldbewit will meet with joe miller in such an endless variety 
new dresses shapes and sizes that he may fancy he possesses all the
collected wit ages brought down to the present moment the young
clerical will find sermons adapted
who who will you buy my good matches
who who will you buy my good matches
buy my good matches come buy'em me
 he is usually dressed in something like an old military greatcoat
wears spectacles and walks with a stick
and is a match for any body match him who can cried frank harry
but bless your heart that's nothing to another set gentry who
have infested our streets in clean apparel with a broom in their hands
holding at the same time a hat to receive the contributions the
passengers whose benevolent donations are drawn forth without inquiry
by the appearance the applicant
it must said tallyhoho arise from the distresses the times
there may be something in that said tom but in many instances it
has arisen from the depravity the times to work upon the wellknown
benevolent feelings john bull for those who emulate the public
streets this overgrown and still increasing metropolis and its
principal avenues are continually pestered with impudent impostors 
both sexes soliciting charity men and women young and old who get
more by their pretended distresses in one day than many industrious and
painstaking tradesmen or mechanics do in a week all the miseries
all the pains life with tears that ought to be their honest and
invariable signals can be and are counterfeited limbs which enjoy the
fair proportion nature are distorted to work upon humanity fits
are feigned and wounds manufactured rags and other appearances the
most squalid and abject poverty are assumed as the best engines 
deceit to procure riches to the idle and debaucheries to the infamous
ideal objects commiseration are undoubtedly to be met with though
rarely to be found it requires a being hackneyed in the ways men or
having at least some knowledge the town to be able to discriminate
the party deserving benevolence but
a begging they will go will go
and a begging they will go
the chief cause assigned by some for the innumerable classes 
mendicants that infest our streets is a sort innate principle 
independence and love liberty however it must be apparent that they
do not like to work and to beg they are not ashamed they are
with very few exceptions lazy and impudent and then what is
collected from the humane but deluded passengers is course expended
at their festivals in broad street st giles's or some other equally
elegant and appropriate part the town to which we shall at an early
period pay a visit their impudence is intolerable for if refused
a contribution they frequently follow up the denial with the vilest
execrations
to make the wretched blest
private charity is best
the common beggar spurns at your laws indeed many their arts are so
difficult detection that they are enabled to escape the vigilance 
the police and with impunity insult those who do not comply with their
wishes seeming almost to say
while i am a beggar i will rail
and say there is no sin but to be rich
and being rich my virtue then shall be
to say there is no vice but beggary
begging has become so much a sort trade that parents have been
known to give their daughters or sons the begging certain streets in
the metropolis as marriage portions and some years ago some scoundrels
were in the practice visiting the outskirts the town in sailors
dresses pretending to be dumb and producing written papers stating
that their tongues had been cut out by the algerine by which means
they excited compassion and were enabled to live well
no doubt it is a good trade said merry well and i expected we
should have been made better acquainted with its real advantages by
capt barclay walking and sporting celebrity who it was said had
laid a wager l that he would walk from london to edinburgh in
the assumed character a beggar pay all his expences living well
on the road and save out his gains fifty pounds
true said tom but according to the best account that can be
obtained that report is without foundation the establishment however
 the mendicity society's
 the frauds and impositions practised upon the public are
so numerous that volumes might be filled by detailing the
arts that have been and are resorted to by mendicants and
the records the society alluded to would furnish
instances that might almost stagger the belief the most
credulous the life the infamous vaux exhibits numerous
instances in which he obtained money under genteel
professions by going about with a petition soliciting the
aid and assistance the charitable and humane and
therefore are continually cheats who go from door to door
collecting money for distressed families or for charitable
purposes it is however a subject so abundant and
increasing by every day's observation that we shall for the
present dismiss it as there will be other opportunities in
the course the work for going more copiously into it
 is calculated to discover much on this subject and has already
brought to light many instances depravity and deception well
deserving the serious consideration the public
as they approached the the poultry this said dashall is
the heart the first commercial city in the known world on the right
is the mansion house the residence the lord mayor for the time
being
the moon had by this time almost withdrawn her cheering beams and there
was every appearance from the gathering clouds a shower rain
it is rather a heavy looking building from what i can see at present
replied tallyhoho
egad said tom the appearance every thing at this moment is
gloomy let us cross
with this they crossed the road to debate's the pastry cook's shop
zounds said tom casting his eye upon the clock it is after ten i
begin to suspect we must alter our course and defer a view the east
to a more favourable opportunity and particularly as we are likely to
have an accompaniment water
never mind said merrywell we can very soon be in very comfortable
quarters besides a rattler is always to be had or a comfortable
lodging to be procured with an obliging bedfellow don't you begin to
croak before there is any occasion for it what has time to do with us
aye aye said frank harry don't be after damping us before we
get wet this is the land plenty and there is no fear being
lost come along
on the opposite side said tom addressing his cousin is the bank 
england it is a building large extent and immense business you can
now only discern its exterior by the light the lamps it is however
a place to which we must pay a visit and take a complete survey
upon some future occasion in the front is the royal exchange the daily
resort the merchants and traders the metropolis to transact their
various business
come said merry well i find we are all upon the right scent frank
harry has promised to introduce us to a house well known resort in
this neighbourhood we will shelter ourselves under the staple commodity
 the country for the woolsack and the woolpack i apprehend are
synonymous
well thought indeed said dashall it is a house where you may
at all times be certain good accommodation and respectable
society besides i have some acquaintance there long standing and
may probably meet with them so have with you my boys the woolpack
in cornhill continued he addressing himself more particularly to
tallyhoho is a house that has been long established and deservedly
celebrated for its general accommodations partaking as it does the
triple qualifications tavern chophouse and publichouse france
amusing those around him with conjuring tricks to their great
satisfaction and delight nearly opposite the reader the courier satan
elderly gentlemanly with grey hair who heard
 to those who are in the habit visiting this room in an
evening the character alluded to here will immediately be
familiar he is a gentleman well known in the neighbourhood
as an auctioneer and he has a peculiar manner reading
with strong emphasis certain passages at the which
he makes long pauses laughs with inward satisfaction and
not infrequently infuses a degree pleasantry in others
the courier is his favourite paper and if drawn into an
argument he is not to be easily subdued
at arguing too each person own'd his skill
for e'en tho vanquish'd he can argue still
 this gentleman who is also well known in the room where
he generally smokes his pipe an evening is plain and
blunt but affable and communicative in his manners bold in
his assertions and has proved himself courageous in
defending them asthmatic and by some termed phlegmatic
but an intelligent and agreeable companion unless thwarted
in his argument a stanch friend to the late queen and the
constitution his country with a desire to have the
constitution the whole constitution and nothing but the
constitution 
 what was passing but said nothing he however puffed away large
quantities smoke at every pause the reader and occasionally
grinn'd at the contents the paper from which tallyhoho readily
concluded that he was in direct political opposition to its sentiments
the acquisition new company was not lost upon to those who were
seated at the round table and it was not long before the hon tom
dashall was informed that they hoped to have the honour his cousin's
name as a member nor were they backward in conveying a similar hint
to frank harry who immediately proposed his two friends mortimer and
merry well an example which was followed by tom's proposing his cousin
illustration pages road to a fight
such respectable introductions could not fail to meet the approbation
 the gentlemen present consequently they were unanimously elected
knights the round table which was almost as quickly supplied by the
waiter with a capacious bowl punch and the healths the newgate
members drank with three times three when their attention was suddenly
drawn to a distant part the room where a sprightly stripling who
was seated by the swarthy conjuror before mentioned was singing the
following song
the joys a mill
or
a toddle to a fight
now's the time for milling boys since all the world's agog
for it
away to copthorne mouse hurst or clipperton they go
or grave or gay they post away nay pawn their very togs
for it
and determined to be up to all go down to see the show
giddy pated hearts elated cash and courage all to view it
ev'ry one to learn a bit and tell his neighbours how to do it
e'en little sprites in lily whites are fibbing it and rushing it
your dashing swells from bagnigge wells are flooring it and
flushing it
oh tis a sight so gay and so uproarious
that all the world is up in arms and ready for a fight
the roads are so clogg'd that they beggar all description now
with lads and lasses prim'd and grogg'd for bangup fun and
glee
here's carts and gigs and knowing prigs all ready to kick up a row
and ev'ry one is anxious to obtain a place to see
here's a noted sprig life who sports his tits and slumber too
and there is cribs and gully beecher oliver and h armer too
with shelton bitton turner hales and all the lads to go it well
who now and then to please the fancy make opponents know it
well
oh tis a sight c
but now the fight's begun and the combatants are setting to
silence is aloud proclaim'd by voices base and shrill
facing stoppingfibbing dropping claret tapping betting too
reeling rapping physic napping all to grace the mill
losing winning horselaugh grinning mind you do not glance
away
or somebody may mill your mug and your nob in chancery
for nobs and bobs and empty fobs the like no tongue could ever
tell
see here's the heavyhanded gas and there's the mighty nonpareil

oh tis a sight c
thus milling is the fashion grown and ev'ry one a closer is
with lessons from the lads fist to turn out quite the thing
true science may be learn'd where'er the fam'd mendoza is
and gallantry and bottom too from scroggins martin spring
for sparring now is all the rage in town and country places
too
and collarbones and claretmugs are often seen at races too
while counterhits and give and take as long as strength can
hold her seat
afford the best amusement in a bit pugilistic treat
oh tis a sight c
while this song was singing universal silence prevailed but an uproar
 approbation followed which lasted for some minutes with a general
call encore which however soon subsided and the company was again
restored to their former state conversation each party appearing
distinct indulged in such observations and remarks as were most
suitable or agreeable to themselves
bob was highly pleased with this description a milling match and as
the singer was sitting near the person who had excited a considerable
portion his attention at intervals in watching his tricks in some 
which great ingenuity was displayed he asked his cousin if he knew him
know him replied tom to be sure i do that is no other than bitton
a wellknown pugilist who frequently exhibits at the fivescourt he is
a jew and employs his time in giving lessons
zounds said mortimer he seems to have studied the art 
legerdemain as well as the science milling
he is an old customer here said a little gentleman at the opposite
side the table drawing from his pocket a box segars now
sir continued he if you wish for a treat addressing himself to
tallyhoho allow me to select you one there sir is agar like a
nosegay i had it from a friend mine who only arrived yesterday you
don't often meet with such i assure you
bob accepted the offer and was in the act lighting it when bitton
approached toward their the room with some cards in his hand
from which bob began to anticipate he would shew some tricks upon them
as soon as he came near the table he had his eye upon the hon tom
dashall to whom he introduced himself by the presentation a card
which announced his benefit for the next week at the fivescourt when
all the prime lads the ring had promised to exhibit
egad said dashall it will be an excellent opportunity what will
you take a trip that way and see the mighty men fist
with all my heart said tallyhoho
and mine too exclaimed mortimer
it was therefore quickly determined and each the party being
supplied with a ticket bitton canvassed the room for other customers
after which he again retired to his seat
come said a smartly dressed gentleman in a white hat we have heard
a song from the other the room i hope we shall be able to muster
one here
 this gentleman whose dress and appearance indicate
something the dandy is a resident in mark lane and
usually spends his evening at the round table where he
appears to pride himself upon producing the finest sears
that can be procured and generally affords some his
friends an opportunity proving them deserving the
recommendations with which he never fails to present them
this proposition was received with applause and upon tom's giving a
hint frank harry was called upon the glasses were filled a toast was
given and the bowl was dispatched for a replenish he then sung
the following song accompanied with voice manner and action well
calculated to rivet attention and obtain applause
piggish propensities
the bumpkin in town
a bumpkin to london one morning in spring
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
took a fat pig to market his leg in a string
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the clown drove him forward while piggy good lack
lik'd his old home so well he still tried to run back
spoken come come said the bumpkin to himself lunnun is the
grand mart for every thing there they have their auction marts their
coffee marts and their linen marts and as they are fond a tidbit
 country pork i see no reason why they should not have a pork and
bacon mart so get on pig grunts i am glad to hear you have a voice
on the subject though it seems not quite in tune with my
hey derry ho derry fal de rat la
it chanc'd on the road they'd a dreadful disaster
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the grunter ran back twixt the legs his master
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the bumpkin he came to the ground in a crack
and the pig getting loose he ran all the way back
spoken hallo said the clown scrambling up again and scratching
his broken head to be sure i have heard sleightoffhand
hocuspocus and such like but by gum this here be a new manoeuvre
called sleight legs however as no bones be broken between us i'll
endeavour to make use on em once more in following the game in view so
here goes with a
hey derry ho derry c
he set off again with his pig in a rope
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
reach'd london and now for good sale gan to hope
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
but the pig being beat till his bones were quite sore
turning restive rush'd in at a brandyshop door
spoken the genteeler and politer part the world might feel a
little inclined to call this piggish behaviour but certainly after a
long and fatiguing journey nothing can be more refreshing than a drap
 the cratur and deeming this the regular mart for the good stuff in
he bolts leaving his master to sing as long as he pleased hey derry
he deny c
here three snuffy tabbies he put to the rout
hey derry ho derry fal de rai lft
with three drams to the quartern that moment serv'd
out
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
the pig gave a grunt and the clown gave a roar
when the whole the party lay flat on the floor
spoken yes there they lay all a lump and a precious group there
was them the old women well prun'd with snuff and twopenny and
bangup with gin and bitters the fair ones squalled the clown growled
like a bear with a broken head the landlord seeing all that could be
seen as they roll'd over each other stared like a stuck pig while
this grand chorus soft and sweet voices from the swinish multitude
was accompanied by the pig with his usual grunt and a
hey derry ho derry o
the pig soon arose and the door open flew
hey derry ho derry fal de rat la
when this scrambling group was expos'd to my view
hey deny ho derry fal de rat la
he set off again without waiting for jack
and not liking london ran all the way back
spoken the devil take the pig said the bumpkin he is more trouble
than enough the devil take you said miss sukey snuffle for you are
the greatest hog the two i dare say if the truth was known you are
brothers i declare i never was so exposed in all my life said miss
delia doldrum there's my beautiful bloom petticoat that never was
rumpled before in all my life i'm quite shock'd never mind said
the landlord nobody cares about it tho i confess it was a shocking
affair i wish he and his pigs were in the horsepond continued she
endeavouring to hide her blushes with her hand oh my oh my what
said boniface oh my elbow equalled out miss emilia mumble i am

by mutual consent the old women all swore
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
that the clown was a brute and his pig was a boar
hey derry ho derry fal de rai la
he paid for their liquor but grumbled good lack
without money or pig to gang all the way back
spoken by gum said he to himself as he turn'd from the door if the
lunneners likes country pork country pork dont seem to like they and
if this be the success i'm to expect in this mighty great town in search
 the grand mart i'll come no more for i thinks as how its all a
flax therefore i'll make myself contented to set at home in my own
chimney corner in the country and sing
hey derry ho derry c
this song had attracted the attention almost every one in the room
there was a spirit and vivacity in the singer combined with a power 
abruptly changing his voice to give effect to the different passages
and a knowledge music as well as character which gave it an
irresistible charm and the company who had assembled round him at the
close signified their approbation by a universal shout applause
all went on well songs toasts and sentiments punch puns and
witticisms were handed about in abundance in the mean time the
room began to wear an appearance thinness many the boxes were
completely deserted and the knights the bound table were no
longer surrounded by their esquires still the joys the bowl were
exhilarating and the conversation agreeable though at times a little
more in a strain vociferation than had been manifested at the
entrance our party it was no time to ask questions as to the names
and occupations the persons by whom he was surrounded and bob
plainly perceiving frank harry was getting into queer street very
prudently declined all interrogatories for the present making however
a determination within himself to know more the house and the
company
mortimer also discovered symptoms lushlogic for though he had an
inclination to keep up the chaff his dictionary appeared to be new
modelled and his lingo abridged by repeated clips at his mother tongue
by which he afforded considerable food for laughter
perceiving this tallyhoho thought it prudent to give his cousin a hint
which was immediately taken and the party broke up
chapter xix
o there are swilling wights in london town
term'd jolly dogs choice spirits alias swine
who pour in midnight revel bumpers down
making their throats a thoroughfare for wine
these spendthrifts who life's pleasures thus outrun
dosing with headaches till the afternoon
lose half men's regular estate sun
by borrowing too largely the moon
and being bacchi plexus full wine
although they have a tolerable notion
 aiming at progressive motion
tis not direct tis rather serpentine
upon leaving the house it was quickly discovered that mortimer was at
sea without a rudder or compass but was still enabled to preserve the
true line beauty which is said to be in a flowing curve merry well
was magnanimous frank harry poppy and all them rather muggy harry
was going eastward and the remainder the party westward it was
halfpast one in the morning the weather had cleared up as their brains
had been getting foggy
tom proposed a rattler
frank harry swore by the bacchanalian divinity they might ride in
the rumbletumble if they liked but none it for him and began to
stammer out
how sweet in the woodlands
wi with feet hound and horn
to awaken shrill hiccup echo
and taste the hiccup fresh morn
during this time having turned to the right on leaving the woolpack
instead the left they were pursuing their way down gracechurch
street in a line with london bridge without discovering their mistake
nor were they aware the situation they were in till they
reached the monument
zounds said tom we are all wrong here
all right said merrywell all right my boys go it my kidneys
bob hearing his cousin's exclamation began to make enquiries
never mind said tom we shall get housed presently i have it i
know the shop it is but seldom i get out the way so come along i
dare say we shall see some more fun yet
saying this he led the way down thames street and in a short time
introduced them to the celebrated house in darkhouse lane kept open
at all hours the night for the accommodation persons coming to
market and going off by the gravesend boats and packets early in the
morning
on entering this house nocturnal convenience a wide field for
observation was immediately opened to the mind dashall he was no
novice to the varieties character generally to be found within its
walls and he anticipated an opportunity imparting considerable
information to his cousin though somewhat clogg'd by his companions
being known however at the bar he found no difficulty in providing them
with beds which being accomplished
now said tom for a new scene in real life here we are situated at
billingsgate on the banks the thames in another hour it will be all
alive we will refresh ourselves with coffee and then look around us
but while it is preparing we will take a survey the interior button
up tie a silk handkerchief round your neck and we may perhaps escape
suspicion being mere lookers on by which means we shall be enabled
to mingle with the customers in the taproom and no doubt you will see
some rum ones
they now entered the tap or general room which exhibited an appearance
beyond the powers description
in one corner lay a sailor fast asleep having taken so much ballast onboard
as to prevent the possibility any longer attending to the log
but with due precaution resting his head on a bundle which he intended
to take on board his ship with him in the morning and apparently
well guarded by a female on each side in another was a weatherbeaten
fisherman in a guernsey frock and a thick woollen nightcap who
having just arrived with a cargo fish was toiling away time till
the commencement the market with a pipe and a pint by whose side was
seated a large newfoundland dog whose gravity countenance formed an
excellent contrast with that a man who was entertaining the fisherman
with a history his adventures through the day and who in return was
allowed to participate in the repeatedly filled pint a waterman in
his coat and badge ready for a customer and two women each having a
shallow basket for the purpose supplying themselves with fish at the
first market for the next day's sale
going to gravesend gentlemen enquired the waterman as tom and bob
took their seats near him
no was the reply
beg pardon sir thought as how you was going down and mought want a
boat that's all hope no offence
i vas down at the frying pan in brick lane yesterday said the
communicative adventurer snivelling bill and carrotty poll was therein
rum order you know carrotty poll so poll good health to you you
knows how gallows lusty she gets veil as i vas saying she had had a
good day with her fish and bang she comes back to bill you knows she's
rather nutty upon bill and according to my thinking they manages things
pretty veil together only you see as how she is too many for him so
when she comes back b tie if bill wasn't a playing at skittles
and hadn't sold a dab all day howsomever he was a winning the lush
so you know bill didn't care but my eyes how she did blow him up when
she com'd in and see'd him just a going to bowl and tip she tipp'd him
a vollopper right across the snout what made the skittles dance again
and bang goes the bowl at her sconce instead the skittles it vas
lucky for her it did not hit her for if it had i'll be d d if
ever she'd a cried buy my live flounders any more he vas at play with
sam stripe the tailor so the fleacatcher he jumps in between em
and being a piecebotcher he thought he could be peacemaker but
it wouldn't do tho he jump'd about like a parch'd pea in a
fryingpan poll called him stitch louse bid him pick up his needles
and be off bill wanted to get at poll poll wanted to get at bill and
between them the poor tailor got more stripes upon his jacket than
there is colours in a harlequin's breeches at barley fair here's
good health to you it was a bodkin to a but brandy poor snip
didn't skip out this here world into that are
and how did they settle it enquired the fisherman
i'll tell you all about it i never see'd such a b dy lark in all
my life poor sam is at all times as thin as a threadpaper and being
but the ninth part a man he stood no chance between a man and
a woman bill vas bleeding at the monk like a halfkilled hog and
carrotty moll full fire and fury vas defending herself with her
fishbasket billy vas a snivelling poll a steering and the poor
tailor in a funk thinks i to myself this here vont never do so up
i goes to poll poll says i to the devil i pitch you says
she only you know i knows poll veil enough she tried to sneak it
over me but she found as how i know'd better poll says i hold your
luff give us no more patter about this here rum rig i'll give cost
price for the fish and you shall have the money and while i was
bargaining with her d n me if bill and the tailor wasn't a milling
away in good style till stripe's wife comes in gives snivelling billy
a crossbuttock and bolted off with her fancy like as the song says
the devil took the tailor
with the broad cloth under his arm
i never laugh'd so in all my life i thought i should 
at this moment a nod from the landlord informed tom his coffee was
ready when they were ushered into the parlour
bob who had during the conversation in the other room which had
occasionally been interrupted by the snores the sleepy sailor the
giggling the girls who appeared to have him in charge and a growl
from the dog been particularly attentive to the narration this
adventure remarked that there was a peculiarity dialect introduced
which to a person coming out the country would have been wholly
unintelligible
yes replied tom almost every trade and every calling which the
numerous inhabitants this overgrown town is composed has a language
 its own differing as widely from each other as those provincials
nor is this less observable in high life where every one seems at times
to aim at rendering himself conspicuous for some extraordinary mode 
expression but come i perceive the morning is shedding its
rays upon us and we shall be able to take a survey the more general
visitors to this place extensive utility and resort already you may
hear the rumbling carts in thames street and the shrill voice the
fishwives who are preparing for a day's work which they will nearly
finish before twothirds the population leave their pillows this
market which is principally supplied by fishing smacks and boats coming
from the sea up the river thames and partly by land carriage from every
distance within the limits england and part wales is open every
morning at daylight and supplies the retailers for some miles round
the metropolis the regular shopkeepers come here in carts to purchase
 what is called the fish salesman who stands as it were between the
fisherman who brings his cargo to market and the retailer but there are
innumerable hawkers fish through the streets who come and purchase
for themselves at first hand particularly mackarel herrings
sprats lobsters shrimps flounders soles c and also cod
and salmon when in season and at a moderate rate composing an
heterogeneous group persons and characters not easily to be met with
elsewhere then said bob there is a certainty high and
exalted entertainment i should suppose the supply fish is very
considerable
the quantity fish consumed replied tom in london is
comparatively small fish being excessively dear in general and this
is perhaps the most culpable defect in the supply the capital
considering that the rivers great britain and the seas round her
coast teem with that food there are on an average about cargoes
 fish tons each brought to billingsgate and about tons
by land carriage making a total about tons and the street
venders form a sample low life in all its situations
in such indexes although small
to their subsequent volumes there is seen
the baby figure the giant mass
 things to come at large
and the language you have already heard forms a part what may be
termed cockneyism
cockneyism said bob with an inquisitiveness in his countenance
 yes continued tom cockney is universally known to be the
contemptuous appellation given to an uneducated native london
brought into life within the sound bow bell pert and conceited
yet truly ignorant they generally discover themselves by their mode 
speech notwithstanding they have frequent opportunities hearing the
best language the cause i apprehend is a carelessness every thing
but the accumulation money which is considered so important with
them that they seem at all times to be in eager pursuit it
o plutus god gold thine aid impart
teach me to catch the moneycatching art
or sly mercurial pilfering god old
thy lesser mysteries at least unfold
you will hear these gentry frequently deliver themselves in something
like the following manner
my eyes jim vat slippy walking tis this here morning i should ave
fell'd right down if so be as how i ain't catched ould a posts vere
does you thinks i ave been vy all the way to rapping vail an a top o
tower hill i seed a woman pillar'd such scouring and squeezing and
pelting with eggs ow funny
a female fruitseller will say to a lady oysterdealer law my dear
mrs melton how ar you this could morning mem the streets vil be
nice and dirty vel for my part i always likes dry wether do your
husband work at foxall still i likes to warm my could nose with a
pinch your snuff ow were obliging but come i hear the bustle 
billingsgate and you shall have a peep at the people by this time they
are all alive
bob laughed at his cousin's specimens cockney language and they
sallied forth to make further observations
it was now a fine morning the sun shone with resplendent lustre upon
all around them and danced in playful dimples on the sportive thames
there was however but little opportunity at the moment for them to
contemplate subjects this sort their eyes and ears being wholly
attracted by the passing and repassing the persons desirous to sell
or supply themselves with fish thames street was almost blocked up with
carts and the hallooing and bawling the different drivers loading
or unloading formed an occasional symphony to the continual hum
 those who were moving in all directions to and from the market
by yer leaf said a sturdy built fellow sweating under a load fish
which appeared to press him almost down what the devil do you stand in
the way for
bob in stepping on one side to make room for this man to pass
unfortunately trod upon the toe an hibernian lady who was bearing
away a large basket shrimps alive and at the same time gave her arm
so forcible a jerk with his elbow as disengaged her hand from the load
by which means the whole cargo was overturned smack into the bosom a
smartly dressed youth in white ducks who was conducting some ladies
on board one the gravesend boats the confusion that followed is
scarcely to be conceived the agitation tale who at hearing the
vociferated lamentations the irish woman the spluttering the
disconcerted dandy the declaration the owner the shrimps that
so help her god he should pay for her property the loud laughter 
those around them who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment the whole
party and the shrimps hopping and jumping about amid the dirt and slush
 the pavement while the ladies were hunting those which had fallen
into the bosom their conductor formed a scene altogether which
in spite the confusion his cousin almost convulsed the hon tom
dashall with laughter and which served but to increase the rancour 
the owner the shrimps and the poor toesuffering irishwoman the
execrations the dandy gentleman and his ladies and the miseries 
poor bob to escape from which he gave the hibernian and her employer
enough to purchase plaster for the one and a fresh cargo for the other
and seizing tom by the arm dragged him away from the scene his
misfortunes in fishery
illustration pages real life at billingsgate
their progress however was presently impeded by a sudden scream which
appeared to come from a female and drew together almost all the people
on the spot it seemed as if it had been a preconceived signal for a
general muster and it was quickly ascertained that fiftycuffs were the
order the day by the vociferations the spectators and the loud
acclamations go it poll pitch it into her mill her snatched veil
done sail all pluck game to the backbone peppermint her
upperstory and grapple her knowledgebox d n my eyes but that
vas a good one it has altered her weathercock and shifted her
wind there's your dairies stand out the way upon my sole you have
overturned all my flounders d n you and your dabs too
tom and bob took up a favourable position for observation at the corner
 a fishstall where they could quietly witness the combatants and
take a general survey the proceedings
now said tom here is a lark for you a female fight
fine salmon or cod gentlemen said an elderly woman i wish i could
tempt you to be customers
well said bob they are at it in good earnest
o yes said the woman we always have it in real earnest no sham i
wish poll may serve her out for sall is a d d saucy b h at
all times
and what have they quarrelled about inquired dashall
jealousy sir nothing else that there man in the nightcap with the
red ruff round his neck is sail's fancy man and he sometimes lets
her have a cargo fish for services done and performed you
understand and so sail she comes down this morning and she finds poll
having a philos with him that's all but i wish they would go and
have it out somewhere else for it spoils all business dance go and
get us a quartern jacky that i may ax these gentlemen to drink for
its a cold morning and perhaps they are not used to be up so early
tom saw the drift this in a moment and taking the hint supplied the
needful to dance who was dispatched for the heartcheering beverage
which they could perceive was in high reputation by those around them
the effluvia the fish the fumes tobacco and the reviving
scent the ginbottle rendered their olfactory salutations truly
delightful nor could they escape the fishwife without becoming
participators in the half pint blue ruin
come said tom we will now stroll a little further and take a
survey the street but first we will give a look here
this said he is the custom house a splendid building recently
erected in consequence the old one being demolished by fire in
 it is indeed replied bob admiring the south front
which is executed in portland stone
do you observe continued tom the central compartment which
comprises what is called the long room and which we will visit
presently is quite plain except the attic which is elegantly
ornamented that altorelievo contains allegorical representations 
the arts and sciences as connected with and promoting the commerce
and industry the nation that to the west a representation 
the costume and character the various nations with whom we hold
intercourse in our commercial relations in the centre under the large
massive dialplate are inscribed in large bronze letters the names 
the founders and the date its erection the figures which support
the dial in a recumbent position are emblematical industry and
plenty that bold projection in the centre gives a suitable character
to the king's warehouse and forms an appropriate support to the
imperial arms upheld by the attributes ocean and commerce
bob gazed with admiration and delight on this truly admirable and
extensive pile national architecture the gentle breeze from the
river the occasional dash the oar and the activity which appeared
on board the different vessels together with the view london bridge
on one side over which he could perceive pedestrians and vehicles
 various kinds passing and repassing and the tower on the other
conspired to heighten and give a most imposing effect to the scene
the designs said tallyhoho are truly creditable to the taste and
science the architect
and this quay in front is intended to be enlarged by filling up a part
 the river besides which a new wall and quay are to be formed from
the tower to billingsgate and numerous other improvements are projected
in the contiguous streets and lanes not before it is necessary was
the reply it would be impossible continued dashall to visit all
the apartments this building contains we will however have a look
at the long room and as we proceed i will endeavour to give you some
further information we are now entering the east wing which is a
counterpart that on the west having like this a grand staircase
with a double flight steps which conduct to a lobby at each 
 the long room lighted by these vertical lanternlights the
ceilings being perforated in square compartments and glazed these
lobbies serve to check the great draughts air which would otherwise
flow through the room if it opened directly from the staircase
they now entered the long room the imposing appearance which had its
due effect upon tallyhoho
bless me cried he in a state ecstasy this is a room to boast 
indeed
yes replied his cousin there is not such another room in europe it
is feet long by wide and proportionably high divided into
three compartments by these eight massive pillars from which as you
perceive spring the three domes which are so richly ornamented and
ventilated through the centre each
and all stone inquired bob
not exactly so was the reply the floor excepting the situation
 the officers and clerks is stone but the walls and ceilings are
drawn out and tinted in imitation
and what are these antique pedestals for merely ornaments
tom was pleased at this inquiry and with a smile satisfaction
replied no these pedestals do double duty and are something like
what the rural poet goldsmith describes in his deserted village
the chest contriv'd a double debt to pay
a bed by night a chest drawers by day
these are ornamental during the summer but useful in the winter they
contain fireplaces completely hid from view
fireplaces reechoed bob
yes continued his cousin the smoke descending passes through the
piers on each side and by their means a sufficient warmth is at all
times kept up in the room
that is a capital contrivance said tallyhoho
then to prevent the possibility sustaining any serious injury from
fire on the ground one and two pair stories the communication is cutoff
by means iron doors which run on wheels in chase in the centre
 the walls and are moved backward and forward by a windlass
which doors are closed every evening and would effectually prevent
a communication beyond their boundaries fireproof rooms also as
repositories for valuable books and papers are provided on each
floor where the important documents the establishment are deposited
every evening and removed in trunks to the respective offices there
are in all rooms devoted to various offices this however is the
principal here the general business is transacted particularly for all
foreign concerns both inwards and outwards the ship master first makes
the report the cargo here the entries which either for payment
 duties warehousing or subsequent exportation are all passed with
the respective officers in this room the business the customs is
managed by nine commissioners whose jurisdiction extends over all
parts england we will now pass out at the west wing adjourn to yon
tavern refresh and refit and after which a further walk
with all my heart said tallyhoho
what ho master b said dashall saluting the landlord as he
entered the tavern how does the world wag with you send us some soda
water the newspaper let somebody clean our boots give us pen ink and
paper and prepare us some breakfast with all speed but no fish mind
that
the landlord bowed assent to his honourable customer and by the time
they were ready their orders were complied with
pray inquired dashall the obliging landlord who came in to ask if
they were supplied with all they wished for did you ever recover anything
from that dashing blade that so obligingly ordered his dinner
here
never got a halfpenny no no he was not one those sort 
gentry nor do i ever wish to see such again in my house
this was uttered in a tone discontent which evidently shewed he had
no relish for the conversation
dashall could not refrain from laughter upon perceiving which the
landlord withdrew with a loud slam the door and left his customers
to enjoy their mirth
what are you laughing at cried bob
why continued his cousin
there was as fame reports in days yore
at least some fifty years ago or more
a pleasant wight on town 
 and there are many pleasant fellows now to be met with but you
shall have the tale as i had it this house has been celebrated for
furnishing excellent dinners and the cookery fish in particular
consequently it has been the resort the bucks the bloods and the
dashing swells the town and i myself have been well entertained
here it will therefore not be wondered at that its accommodations
should attract the notice a sharper whose name and character were
well known but who was in person a total stranger to the unsuspecting
landlord whom however he did not fail to visit
calling one afternoon for the purpose seeing how the land lay in
high twig and fashionably dressed he was supplied with a bothered into a spacious
apartmentparticularly elegant being unincumbered the ceiling
finished in a superior style and decorated with paintings the late
king and queen james the second lord sandwich lord howe and mr
pitt here bob wandered from portrait to portrait examining the
features and character each and admiring the skill and ability 
the artists at the upper the room he was additionally pleased
to find a large painting containing a group about twentyfour 
the elder brethren representing them at full length attended by their
secretary the late mr court many the persons being well remembered
by dashall were pointed out by him to his cousin and brought to his
recollection names deservedly celebrated though now no more this
picture was the gift the merchant brethren in 
tallyhoho was much delighted with his survey this truly elegant
building and the luminous account given by his cousin 
the various persons whose portraits met his eye or whose names and
characters connected with the establishment had become celebrated for
scientific research or indefatigable industry
it will occupy too much time this morning said dashall to visit
the interior the tower as i have dispatched a ticketporter to
piccadilly ordering my curricle to be at tom's coffeehouse at one we
will therefore defer that pleasure to the next opportunity being this
way we will however take a look at the bank and the exchange then a
trundle into the fresh air for an hour and return home to dinner so
come along but we will vary our walk by taking another road back
with this intention they now crossed tower hill and turned to the
left along the minores
here is a place said dashall well known and no doubt you have
often heard sparrow corner and rosemary lane are better known by
the appellation rag fair it is a general mart for the sale 
secondhand clothes and many a welllooking man in london is indebted
to his occasional rambles in this quarter for his appearance the
business this place is conducted with great regularity and the
dealers and collectors old clothes meet at a certain hour the
afternoon to make sales and exchanges so that it is managed almost upon
the same plan as the royal exchange only that the dealers here come
loaded with their goods which must undergo inspection before sales can
be effected while the merchant carries with him merely a sample or
directs his purchaser to the warehouse where his cargo is deposited the
principal inhabitants this place are jews and they obtain supplies
from the numerous itinerant collectors from all quarters london and
its suburbs whom you must have observed parading the streets from the
earliest hour the morning crying ould clothes clothes sale 
it surely can hardly be a trade worth following said talltho
there are many hundreds daily wandering the streets however replied
tom in pursuit castoff apparel rags and metals different
sorts or at least pretend so the jews are altogether a set traders
i do not mean to confine my observations to them only because there
are persons other sects employed in the same kind business and
perhaps a more dangerous set cheats could scarcely be pointed
at as their chief business really is to prowl about the houses and
stables people rank and fortune in order to hold out temptations
to their servants to pilfer and steal small articles not likely to be
missed which these fellows are willing to purchase at about onethird
 their real value it is supposed that upwards these
depraved itinerants among the jews are daily employed in journeys 
this kind by which means through the medium base money and other
fraudulent dealings many them acquire property with which they open
shops and then become receivers stolen property the losses thus
sustained by the public being almost incalculable
for wit coot gould rings copper gilt tis so he gets his
bread
wit his sealingvax brickdust and his pencils without lead
it is estimated that there are from fifteen to twenty thousand jews in
the metropolis and about five or six thousand more stationed in the
great provincial and seaport towns in london they have six synagogues
and in the country places there are at least twenty more most the
lower classes those distinguished by name german or dutch jews
live principally by their wits and establish a system mischievous
intercourse all over the country the better to enable them to carry
on thenfraudulent designs in every way the pliability their
consciences is truly wonderful
for they never stick at trifles if there's monies in the way
nay i remember the time when they used to perambulate our streets
openly professing to purchase base coin by bawling any bad shilling
any bad shilling the interference the police however has prevented
the calling though perhaps it is impossible to prevent a continuance
 the practice any more than they can that utterance these men
hesitate not to purchase stolen property or metals various kinds as
well as other articles pilfered from the dockyards and stolen in
the provincial towns which are brought to the metropolis to elude
detection and vice versa in some cases there are contrivances that
the buyer and seller shall not even see each other in order that no
advantage may be taken by giving information as to the parties 
upon my life the contrivances london are almost incomprehensible
said bob and might deter many from venturing into it but this
surprises me beyond any thing
it is however too lamentably true continued tom for these people
educated in idleness from the earliest infancy acquire every debauched
and vicious principle which can fit them for the most complicated arts
 fraud and deception to which they seldom fail to add the crime 
perjury whenever it can be useful to shield themselves or their friends
from the punishment the law totally without moral education and
very seldom trained to any trade or occupation by which they can earn an
honest livelihood by manual labour their youths excluded from becoming
apprentices and their females from engaging themselves generally
as servants on account the superstitious adherence to the mere
ceremonial their persuasion as it respects meat not killed by
jews nothing can exceed their melancholy condition both as it regards
themselves and society thus excluded from the resources which other
classes the community possess they seem to have no alternative
but to resort to those tricks and devices which ingenuity suggests
to enable persons without an honest means subsistence to live in
idleness
the richer jews are in the practice lending small sums to the poorer
classes their community in order that they may support themselves by
a species petty traffic but even this system contributes in no
small degree to the commission crimes since in order to render
it productive to an extent equal to the wants families who do not
acquire any material aid by manual labour they are induced to resort to
unlawful means increasing it by which they become public nuisances
from the orangeboy and the retailer seals razors glass and other
wares in the public streets or the collector 
old rags old jags old bonnets old bags
to the shopkeeper dealer in wearing apparel or in silver and gold
the same principles conduct too generally prevail
the itinerants utter base money to enable them by selling cheap to
dispose their goods while those who are stationary with very few
exceptions receive and purchase at an under price whatever is brought
them without asking questions and yet most their concerns
are managed with so much art that we seldom hear a jew being hanged
and it is also a fact that during the holidays which they have many
in the course a year or at one their weddings you may seethe
barrowwoman yesterday decked out in gay and gaudy attire an
expensive nature
by this time they had reached the top the minores and were turning
down houndsditch we are now said dashall close to another place
chiefly inhabited by jews called duke's place where they have a very
elegant synagogue which has been visited by royalty the present king
having during his regency honoured them with a visit through the
introduction the late mr goldsmith if it should be a holiday we
will be present at the religious ceremonies the morning with this
they entered duke's place and were soon within the walls this temple
 judaism in taking a view it bob was much gratified with its
splendid decorations and without being acquainted with their forms had
doffed his castor but was presently informed by his cousin that he
must keep his hat on the readers appeared to him to be singers but the
whole the service being hebrew it was little consequence to him
whether read or sung he perceived during the performances these
prayers which were every now and then joined in by almost everyone
present that many the congregation appeared to be in close
conversation which however was taken no notice by the persons
officiating he was well pleased with the singing a youth and the
accompaniment a gentleman in a cock'd hat for although he could not
discover that he actually produced words he produced sounds in many
instances bearing a strong similarity to those a bassoon the
venerable appearance and devotion the high priest who was habited ina
robe white also attracted his attention while the frequent bursts
 the congregation joining in the exercises the morning in some
instances almost provoked his risibility
the religious ceremonies these people said tom as they left the
synagogue though somewhat imposing as to form and appearance do not
seem to be strongly interesting for many them are engaged during the
whole the service in some species traffic buying and
 doffed his castor taken off his hat
 selling or estimating the value goods for sale they are such
determined merchants and dealers that they cannot forget business even
in the house prayer we have two sets them this is the dutch
synagogue but the most ancient is that the portuguese having been
established in england ever since the usurpation the members it
being mostly wealthy are extremely attentive to their poor among whom
there is said not to be a single beggar or itinerant while the dutch or
german jews get no education at all even the most affluent them are
said to be generally unable either to read or write the language the
country that gave them birth they confine themselves to a bastard or
vulgar hebrew which has little analogy to the original they observe
the particular ritual the german synagogue and also include the
polish russian and turkish jews established in london with the
exception a few wealthy individuals and as many families who are in
trade on the royal exchange they are in general a very indigent class
 people their community being too poor to afford them adequate
relief they have resorted to the expedient lending them small sums
 money at interest to trade upon which is required to be repaid
monthly or weekly as the case may be otherwise they forfeit all claim
to this aid
the portuguese jews are generally opulent and respectable and hold
no community with the others they use a different liturgy and their
language is even different they never intermarry with the jews the
dutch synagogue they pride themselves on their ancestry and give their
children the best education which can be obtained where they reside the
brokers upon the exchange the jewish persuasion are all or chiefly
 the portuguese synagogue their number is limited to twelve by act 
parliament and they pay guineas each for this privilege
they had now reached the houndsditch when passing through
bishopsgate church yard and broad street they were soon at the bank
this building said dashall covers an extent several acres 
ground and is completely isolated
its exterior replied bob is not unsuited to the nature 
the establishment as it certainly conveys an idea strength and
security
 that's true continued tom but you may observe a want 
uniformity design and proportion arising from its having been
erected piecemeal at different periods and according to different
plans by several architects this is the principal entrance and
opposite to it is the shortest street in the metropolis called bank
street it contains but one house now we will take a survey the
interior
they entered the hall where tallyhoho was much pleased to be instructed
as to the methodical way they have examining notes for a reissuing
or exchanging into coin
here said dashall are the drawingoffices for public and private
accounts this room is seventynine feet long by forty and at the
further you observe a very fine piece sculpture that is a
marble statue king william iii the founder the bank thi national
establishment was first incorporated by act parliament in the
projector the scheme was a mr james paterson a native 
scotland and the direction its concerns is vested in a governor
deputygovernor and twentyfour directors elected annually at a
general court the proprietors thirteen the directors with the
governor form a court for the transaction business the bank is open
every day from nine in the morning till five in the afternoon holidays
excepted it is like a little town the clerks at present are about
 in number but a reduction is intended the rotunda is the most
interesting apartment we will go and have a look at the moneydealers
here continued he as they entered the rotunda and mingled among
the various persons and sounds that are so well known in that seat
 traffic from the hours eleven to three a crowd eager
moneydealers assemble and avidity gain displays itself in
evervarying shapes at times truly ludicrous to the disinterested
observer you will presently perceive that the rustling and crowding
 the jobbers to catch a bargain frequently exceed in disorder the
scrambling at the doors our theatres for an early admission and sa
loud and clamorous at times are the mingled noises the buyers and
sellers that all distinction sound is lost in a general uproar
 this description tallyhoho had an absolute proof in a few
minutes for the mingling variety voices appeared to leave no
space in time for distinguishing either the sense or the sound the
individual speakers though it was evident that notwithstanding the
continual hubbub there was a perfect understanding effected
between parties for the sale and transfer stock according to the
stipulations bargained for
ha mr m said the hon tom dashall how do you do
happy to say well sir thank you was the reply any
commands markets are pretty brisk this morning and we are all alive
pray said tallyhoho who is that extraordinary looking lady with such
red lips and cheeks beneath the garb sadness
a constant visitor here replied mr m i may say a day scarcely
passes without her being present
she has a curious appearance said bob her dress is all black
from head to foot and yet her cheeks disclose the ruddy glow 
uninterrupted health is it that her looks belie her garb or that her
garb belies her looks
hush said mr m let her pass and i will give you some information
relative to her which if it does not gratify you will at least
satisfy some your inquiries i am half inclined to believe that allis
not right in the seat government with her pointing his finger to
his head and she is therefore rather deserving pity than an object
 censure or ridicule though i have reason to believe she frequently
meets with attacks the latter when in search the sympathy and
benefit to be derived from a proper exercise the former her name is
miss w her father was formerly a twopenny postman who resided
at rockingham row walworth and was himself somewhat eccentric in his
dress and manners and it was not at all unusual to meet him in
the morning in the garb his office though decidedly against his
inclination and to see him on change during change hours in silk
stockings and in every other way dressed as a merchant attending
there according to custom and practice and he managed by some means
or other to keep up a character respectability and to give an
accomplished education to the younger branches this family so that
this lady though unfortunate in her present circumstances has been
well brought up and mingled in polished society and if
you were to enter into conversation with her now you would find
her intelligent in the selection her words and the combination 
sentences to explain to you the most improbable events and the most
unheard claims that she has upon all the governments in the known
world this however would be done with good temper unless any thing
like an insulting observation should be conceived or intended to be
conveyed
and pray what is supposed to be the cause her present manners and
appearance inquired bob
it is principally attributed replied mr m to the circumstance 
losing a beloved brother who she now continually declares is only kept
from her by the persons who daily visit the rotunda with a view
to prevent the recovery the property she lays claim to and the
particulars which she generally carries in her pocket that brother
however suffered the penalty the law for a forgery but this she
cannot be induced to believe
 the lamentable effusion blood which has taken place
within the last twenty years in consequence forgeries on
the bank england has already excited a very considerable
portion public interest and indignation and it is much
to be feared that notwithstanding the very serious expence
the corporation have incurred with a view to remedy the
evil by rendering the imitation more difficult the
anticipated result is not likely to be obtained it will
hardly be conceived that the governors have expended as much
as one hundred thousand pounds in this laudable undertaking
and upon producing an impression we are told it can be
imitated by one who within three weeks produced a facsimile
and puzzled the makers the original note to
discover which was the workmanship their own hands nay
even an engraver on wood is said to have produced an
excellent imitation in a few hours it is however sincerely
to be hoped that an effectual stop will be eventually put to
the possibility committing this crime which we
apprehend nine times out ten brings the poor needy
halfstarved retailer paper to the gallows while the
more unprincipled wholesale dealer escapes detection
while on the subject forged notes we cannot help
deprecating the circulation what are termed flash
notes which if not originally intended to deceive and
defraud are calculated to accomplish these objects when in
the hands the artful and designing we think there is a
tradesman in the vicinity the bank who presents such 
his customers as visits his repository to have their hair
cut c with a hash note purporting to be for and we
have also reason to believe that more than one attempt has
been detected where the parties have really endeavoured to
pass them as valid bank england paper the danger
therefore must be evident
 we have reason to think she is frequently much straitened for
want the necessary supplies for sustenance and she has temporary
relief occasionally from those who knew her family and her former
circumstances in life while she boldly perseveres in the pursuit 
fancied property and the restoration her brother
i have heard her make heavy complaints the difficulties she has had
to encounter and the privations she has been subjected to but her own
language will best speak the impressions on her mind here is a printed
letter which was circulated by her some time ago
to the worthy inhabitants the parish st mary lexington surrey
it is with feelings deep regret i have to deplore the necessity that
compels me to adopt a public measure for the purpose obtaining my
property from those gentlemen that hold it in trust for a period ten
years i have endured the most cruel and unjustifiable persecution which
has occasioned the premature death my mother a considerable loss 
property all my personal effects apparel and valuables has exposed
me to the most wanton and barbarous attacks the greatest insults and
the severe and continual deprivation every common necessary having
made every appeal for my right or even a maintenance without effect
i now take the liberty adopting the advice some opulent friends in
the parish and solicit general favour in a loan by subscription for a
given time not doubting the liberal commiseration many ladies
and gentlemen towards so great a sufferer as it is not possible to
describe the wrongs i have endured the misery that has been heaped upon
me in so limited a space i shall be happy to give every explanation
upon calling for the result this entreaty and to those ladies and
gentlemen that condescend to favour

for the truth this statement or the real existence any property
belonging to her i am not able to vouch she is well known in all
the offices this great establishment is generally peaceable in
her conduct and communicative in her conversation which at times
distinguishes her as a person good education
hard is the fortune which your sex attends women like princes find

the conversation was here interrupted by the arrival a gentleman
who taking mr m on one side tom and bob wished him a good morning
they proceeded to view the various offices which branch out
from the rotunda and which are appropriated to the management each
particular stock in each which bob could not help admiring the happy
disposition every department to facilitate business the arrangement
 the books and the clerks under the several letters the alphabet
he conceived was truly excellent
the corporation the bank said dashall are prohibited from
trading in any sort goods or merchandize whatsoever but are to
confine the use their capital to discounting bills exchange and
to the buying and selling gold and silver bullion with a permission
however to sell such goods as are mortgaged or pawned to them and not
redeemed within three months after the expiration the time for their
redemption their profits arise from their traffic in bullion the
discounting bills exchange for bankers merchants factors and
speculators and the remuneration they receive from government for
managing the public funds and for receiving the subscriptions on loans
and lotteries but we may ramble about in these places for a month and
still have novelty in store and there is a little world underneath the
greater part this extensive building devoted to printingoffices
warerooms c
they had now reached the door which leads into bartholomew lane and
upon descending the steps and turning to the left bob's eyes soon
discovered the auction mart what have we here inquired he
that replied his cousin is a building which may deservedly be
rank'd as one the ornaments the city and its arrangements and
economy as well as the beauty its interior are well deserving the
notice every stranger this fine establishment which serves as a
focus for the sale estates and other property by public auction is
both useful and ornamental it was built about the time when the spirit
 combination was so strong in london you must know some years back
every kind business and trade appeared likely to be carried on by
joint stock companies and the profits divided upon small shares many
fireoffices have to date their origin from this source the hope the
eagle the atlas and others the golden lane brewery was opened
upon this principle some water companies were established till
neighbourhood and partnership almost became synonymous and i
believe among many other institutions that kind the building before
us is one it contains many handsome rooms and commodious offices but
as for offices every street and every alley abounds with them and
nowadays if you want to hire a cook or a scullion you have nothing
to do but to send a letter to a registeroffice and you are suited ina
twinkling it was an excellent idea and i remember the old buck who
used to call himself the founder establishments that nature or
rather the first introducer them to the notice englishmen poor
old courtois
john courtois is said to have been a native picardy where he was
born about the year or he repaired to this country while yet
young in the character valet de chambre to a gentleman who had
picked him up in his travels and as he came from one the poorest
 the french provinces he took root and throve wonderfully on his
transplantation to a richer soil
on the death his master he removed to the neighbourhood the
strand and st martin's street leicester square became the scene 
his industry and success at a time when wigs were worn by boys and a
frenchman was supposed the only person capable making one fit for
the grande monarque he commenced business as a perruquier and
soon acquired both wealth and celebrity to this he joined another
employment which proved equally lucrative and appropriate as it
subjected both masters and servants to his influence this was the
keeping a registeroffice one the first known in the metropolis
whence he drew incalculable advantages he is also said to have been a
dealer in hair which he imported largely from the continent and yet
after all it is difficult to conceive how he could have realized a
fortune exceeding l but what may not be achieved by a man who
despised no gains however small and in his own expressive language
considered farthings as the seeds guineas
the following appears to be a true description this very
extraordinary man whom we ourselves have seen more than once old
courtois was well known for more than half a century in the purlieus 
st martin's and the haymarket his appearance was meagre and squalid
and his clothes such as they were were pertinaciously got up in
exactly the same cut and fashion and the colour always either fawn or
marine for the last thirty years the venerable chapeau was uniformly
 the same cock the principal feat however in which this fervent
votary plutus appeared before the public was his nearly fatal affair
with mary benson otherwise mrs maria theresa phepoe in april 
this illfatedwoman projected a rather bungling scheme in order
to frighten her old acquaintance and visitor courtois out a
considerable sum money one evening when she was certain his
calling she had her apartment prepared for his reception in a species
 funereal style a bier a black velvet pall black wax candles
lighted c no sooner had the friend entered the room than the lady
assisted by her maid pounced on him forced him into an arm chair
in which he was forcibly held down by the woman while the hostess
brandishing a caseknife or razor swore with some violent imprecations
that instant should be his last if he did not give her an order on his
banker for a large sum money the venerable visitor alarmed at the
gloomy preparations and dire threats the desperate female asked for
pen ink and paper which being immediately produced he wrote a check
on his banker for two thousand pounds he immediately retired with
precipitation happy to escape without personal injury the next
morning before its opening he attended at the banker's with some
policeofficers and on mrs phepoe's making her appearance with the
check she was arrested and subsequently tried at the old bailey on a
capital charge grounded on the above proceedings however through
the able defence made by her counsel the late mr fielding who took a
legal objection to the case as proved and contended that she never
had or obtained any property mr courtois on the principle that
possession constituted the first badge ownership she was only
sentenced to twelve months imprisonment
some years since the late lord gage met courtois at the courtroom 
the east india house on an election business ah courtois said his
lordship what brings you here to give my votes my lord was the
answer what are you a proprietor most certainly and more
votes than one yes my lord i have four aye indeed why
then before you take the pray be kind enough to pin up my curls
with which modest request the proprietor four votes equal to ten
thousand pounds immediately complied
m courtois married a few years since and has left several children
on reflecting that his widow's thirds would amount to an immense sum
with his usual prudence he made a handsome settlement on her during
his lifetime as his sons were not very economical habits he has
bequeathed them small annuities only and vested the bulk his fortune
in trustees on behalf his daughters who are infants
until his death he invariably adhered to the costume the age in
which he was born a threecocked hat and a plumcoloured coat
both rather the worse for wear in which we have seen him frequently
invariably designated his person and habits while a penurious economy
that bid defiance to all vulgar imitation accompanied him to his grave
his death occurred in in the seth or syst year his age
such characters observed tallyhoho notwithstanding their
eccentricity afford useful lessons to those who in this giddy and
dissipated age devote a part their time to thinking
no doubt it replied dashall they furnish examples what maybe
done by perseverance and determination and almost seem to verify the
assertion that every one may become rich if he pleases but come we
must move towards tom's coffee house in our way to which we will
pass through the royal exchange which lies directly before us it was
originally a brick building erected by sir thomas gresham in the year
 but being destroyed by the fire london in the present
building portland stone was raised in its place the first stone
 which was laid by charles in in consequence which his
statue has been placed in the centre its quadrangle around which the
merchants assemble daily to transact their commercial businesses
 the merry monarch was fond the citizens and frequently
honoured the lord mayor's table with his presence it is
said him that on retiring to his carriage one day after
dining with the civic sovereign he was followed by the
latter who with a freedom inspired by the roseate deity
laid hold his majesty by the arm and insisted that he
should not go until he had drunk t'other bottle the monarch
turned round and goodhumouredly repeating a line from an
old song the man that is drunk is as great as a king
went back to the company and doubtless complied with the
lord mayor's request
 it has two principal fronts one in cornhill and the other
which you now see is at the threadneedle street each which
has a piazza affording a convenient shelter from the sun and rain
it is open as a thoroughfare from eight in the morning till six in the
evening but the hours in which business is chiefly transacted are from
two to five its extent is feet by 
by this time they had passed the gate and bob found himself in a
handsome area with a fine piazza carried entirely round and furnished
with seats along the four walks for merchants different nations who
meet each at their different stations and was immediately attracted
by the appearance the numerous specimens art with which it was
adorned
do you observe said his cousin within these piazzas are
twentyeight niches all vacant but that in which is placed a statue 
sir thomas gresham in the northwest angle and that in the southwest
which presents a statue sir john barnard magistrate the city and
one its representatives in parliament those smaller statues in the
niches the wall the quadrangle in the upper story are the kings
and queens england beginning with edward i on the north side and
ending with his late majesty on the east as far as charles i they were
executed by gabriel cibber the various frames which are placed around
under the piazza contain the names residences and occupations 
tradesmen mechanics and others the grand front in cornhill has
been under repair lately and in its appearance no doubt is greatly
improved the steeple which is just raised is a handsome dome
surmounted by the original grasshopper rendered somewhat celebrated by
a prophecy that certain alterations would take place in men manners
and times when the grasshopper on the top the exchange should meet
the dragon at the top bow church and strange and extraordinary as it
may appear this very circumstance is said to have taken place as
they have both been seen in the warehouse some manufacturer to
whom they were consigned for repair in addition to which if
crockery's relation the transmogrifications england is to
be believed the prophecy is in a considerable degree a whimsical and
laughable burnett in one act has recently been produced at the royal
coburg theatre in which mr sloan sings with admirable comicality
the following song alluded to by the hon tom dashall to the tune 
o the roast beef old england
from hinge i came with my master o dear
but lunnun is not like the same place that's clear
it has nigh broke my heart since i have been here
o the old times old england
o dear the good english old times
the town is so changed that i don't know a spot
the times are so hard there's no work to be got
and for porter they charges you tippence a pot
o the old times c
then the sides the houses are stuck full bills
about blacking mockauctions and wonderful fills
but for von wot they cures a hundred they kills
o the old times c
there's the names are all altered brewer i goes
and the people all laughs at the cut my close
the men are turn'd women the belles are turn'd beaux
o the old times c
even i vent out to hinge if any von died
a good wooden coffin they used to provide
but iron sons now keeps the poor worms outside
o the old times c
there's the lancaster schools now all over the land
wot teaches the children to scribble on sand
and a ugly bonassus wot lives in the strand
o the new times c
there's a new lifepreserver with rich you cant drown
and a new kind sovereigns just com'd into town
von is worth a pound note and the other a crown
o the new times c
the playbills have hard words wot i cannot speak
and the organs plays nothing but latin and greek
and it's rain'd every day now for more than a week
o the new times c
there's a man walks on vater and don't vet his feet
and a patent steamkitchen wot cooks all your meat
and epp's ham and beef shop in every street
o the new times c
i walks up and down with the tears in my hye
wot they once call'd a waggon is now call'd a fly
and the boys points their fingers and calls i aguy
o the old times old england
o dear the good english old times
there is a staircase in each front and one on each side which
lead to a gallery above running round the whole building containing
the offices various establishments but i believe in the original
plan shops were intended to fill the building to the top at present
the upper rooms are occupied by lloyd's celebrated subscription
coffeehouse for the use underwriters and merchants by the royal
exchange insurance company and various offices individuals there
are also the gresham lecture rooms where lectures are read pursuant to
the will the late sir thomas gresham who bequeathed to the city 
london and the mercers company all the profits arising from these and
other premises in cornhill in trust to pay salaries to four lecturers
in divinity astronomy music and geometry and three readers in civil
law physic and rhetoric who read lectures daily in term time
this we may consider the grand mart the universe where congregate
those sons commerce the british merchants who in dauntless extent
 enterprise hold such distinguished preeminence
tallyhoho viewed the scene before him with an inquisitive eye and was
evidently wrapped in surprise at the busy hum men all actuated
by one universal object the acquisition wealth the spacious area
exhibited a mass mercantile speculators numerously grouped in
conversation under the piazzas appeared a moving multitude in like
manner engaged while the surrounding seats were in similar occupation
dashall and bob the many hundreds individuals present were
perhaps the only two led to the place by curiosity alone
tallyhoho who on every occasion doubtful dilemma looked to his
cousin dashall for extrication expressed his surprise at the appearance
 a squalid figure whose lank form patched habiliments and unshorn
beard indicated extreme penury in familiar converse with a
gentleman fashionably attired and demeanour to infer unquestionable
respectability
interest said tallyhoho supersedes every other consideration else
these two opposites would not meet
your observation is just replied his cousin the tatterdemallion to
whom you allude is probably less impoverished than penurious perhaps
 miserly habits and in other respects disqualified for polite
society what then he is doubtless in ample possession the essential
requisite and here a monied man only is a good man and without money
no man can be respectable
here the continued and deafening noise a handbell rung by one
 the exchangekeepers underlings perched on the balcony over the
southern gate interrupted mr dashall's remarks it was the signal for
locking up the gates and inferring at the same time obedience to the
summons with due promptitude and submission on pain being detained
two hours in dress vile
sufficient alacrity egression not having been shown the keepers
closed the two gates and at the same time locked the east and western
avenues thus interdicting from egress above three hundred contumacious
individuals including the hon tom dashall and his cousin
a considerable time having now elapsed without any prospect 
enlargement dissatisfaction gained ground apace and shortly ripened
into actual mutiny the disaffected now proceeded to hold a council 
war and after a few moments deliberation it was resolved unanimously
to storm the avenues dashall and
 some years ago a gentleman extensive property residing in the
country was desirous raising by way loan on the security 
landed estates the sum l his solicitor in london with whom
he had corresponded on the subject summoned him at last to town a
lender was found who was to meet the solicitor at a certain time and
place appointed in the neighbourhood the exchange the borrower
on the day and near the hour fixed upon was in the area the royal
exchange when there crossed over a wretched looking being the very
personification misery the gentleman unsolicited gave the poor
object a shilling on going to the appointed rendezvous how great was
his astonishment to find in the person the wealthy monied man the
identical receiver his bounty ha ha cried he you shall not
fare the worse for your generosity and actually advanced the money
on terms much easier than expected this personage was the celebrated
daniel dancer
 tallyhoho declined taking any part in the enterprise they took a
right view the affair they were mere casual visitants not likely
ever again to suffer a similar restraint while the others were in the
daily practice transacting business on the spot to them therefore
the frequent recurrence the present disaster might happen theirs
then was the cause as being most particularly interested
an attack was made by the prisoners upon the portals opening into bank
buildings and sweeting's rents but the former having been shattered
sometime since on a similar occasion and subsequently very strongly
repaired it was found impregnable at least to any immediate exertion
 force and being neither furnished with a park artillery nor with
the battering ram the ancients the little army faced to the right
about enfiladed the area and took up a new position in due order 
assault against the door the avenue leading into sweeting's rents
the affair was decided and without bloodshed the bars soon bent before
the vigour the assailants one these was taken into custody by a
beadle but rescued and the attack recommenced with success when the
opposite door was also opened by the shopkeeper living in that avenue
and the exchange was finally cleared at four minutes past five o'clock
after above an hour's detention including the time occupied in storming
the avenues
the triumph liberty was now complete the intrepid phalanx disbanded
itself and our heroes having made the farewell cone to their
victorious compeers proceeded into cornhill where dashall espying
his curricle at the door tom's coffee house they after refreshing
themselves took a cheerful country drive over london bridge clapham
common wandsworth c from which they returned at six o'clock to
dinner determined to have a night's rest before they proceeded in
search further adventures
chapter xxi
happy the man who void cares and strife
in silken or in leathern purse retains
a splendid shilling he nor hears with pain
new oysters cried nor sighs for cheerful ale
but i whom griping penury surrounds
and hunger sure attendant upon want
with scanty offal and small acid tiff
wretched repast my meagre corse sustain
or solitary walk or dose at home
in garret vile
talking over at the breakfasttable the occurrences the preceding
day on my conscience exclaimed tallyhoho were the antediluvian
age restored and we daily perambulated the streets this immense
metropolis during a hundred years to come i firmly believe that every
hour would bring a fresh accession incident
ad infinitum answered dashall where happiness is the goal in
view and fifteen hundred thousand competitors start for the prize the
manoeuvres all in pursuit the grand ultimatum must ever exhibit an
interesting and boundless variety london
 the needy villain's general home
the common sewer paris and rome
where ingenious vice too frequently triumphs over talented worth where
folly riots in the glare luxury and merit pines in indigent
obscurity allons donc another ramble and chance may probably
illustrate my observation
take notice said the discriminating dashall to his friend as they
reached the mall in st james's park that solitary knight the
woeful countenance his threadbare raiment and dejected aspect denote
disappointment and privation ten imperial sovereigns to a plebeian
 shilling he is either a retired veteran or a distressed poet
the object curiosity who had now seated himself appeared to have
attained the age fifty or more a bat that had once been
black a scantskirted blue coat much the worse for wear a striped
waistcoat his lank legs and thighs wrapt in a pair something
resembling trowsers but a world too wide for his shrunk shanks short
gaiters shoes in the last stage consumption whiskers full
dimensions his head encumbered with an unadjusted redundancyof grey
hair such were the habiliments and figure this son adversity
the two friends now seated themselves on the same bench with the
stranger who absorbed in reflection observed not their approach
the silence the triumvirate was broken in upon by tom who with his
usual suavity manners politely addressed himself to the unknown
on the common topic weather et cetera without eliciting in reply
more than an assenting or dissenting monosyllable you have seen some
service sir
yes
in the army i presume
no
under government
yes
in the navy probably
no
i beg your pardon continued dashall my motives originate not in
idle inquisitiveness if i can be any service 
the stranger turned towards him an eye inquiry i ask not from
impertinent curiosity resumed dashall neither would i wish
indelicately to obtrude an offer assistance perhaps equally
unnecessary as unacceptable yet there are certain liabilities life
wherein sympathy may be allowed to participate
sir said the other with an immediate grateful expansion mind and
freedom communication i am inexpressibly indebted for the honour
 your solicitude and feel no hesitation in acknowledging that i ama
literary writer but so seldom employed and when employed so
inadequately requited that to me the necessaries life are frequently
inaccessible
 here tallyhoho interrupted the narrator by asking whence it
was that he had adopted a profession so irksome them both a hearty welcome arrah what mane
you by a preposterous exhibition by becky the warm hearts the sons
and daughters st patrick have exhibited an unsophisticated feeling
 loyalty very opposite indeed to the chilling indifference not to
say worse it those his subjects at home and as sir william the
big baronet the city said in the house that gives laws to the
land why should not his majesty be cheered up a little
this effusion loyalty was well received and dashall and his cousin
cordially united in the general expression approbation
this is a vera weel said the northern but an overstrained civility
wears ay the semblance o suspicion and fulsome adulation canna be vera
acceptable to the mind o delicate feeling for instance there is
my ain country and a mair ancient or a mair loyal to its legitimate
sovereign there diana exist on the face o the whole earth wad the king
condescend to honor wi his presence the palace o holyrod house he
wad experience as ardent a manifestation o fidelity to his person and
government in auld reekie as that shown him in dublin though violins
no quite sae tumultuous forbye it wadna hae been amiss to hae gain
the preference to a nation whare his ancestors held sway during sae mony
centuries and whare in the castle edinburgh is still preserved the
sacred regalia with which it nigh no hae been apropos to hae graced
his royal head and hand amidst the gratifying pageantry o a scotch
coronation sure i am that north britain has never been honored publicly
wi a royal visit whether ony branch o the present reigning family
hae been there incognita they best ken themselves
you seem to have forgot observed tallyhoho the visit the duke 
cumberland to scotland in the year 
begging your pardon for setting you right in that particular answered
the cynic with a most significant expression countenance that
sir was not a visit but a visitation
appropriate enough whispered dashall to tallyhoho
augh moderation to nice distinctions exclaimed o'shaughnessy here
mister settler be after tipping over anode half quartern the cratur
wit which to drink success to the royal visitant
and that the company may participate in the gratifying expression 
attachment to their sovereign landlord said dashall let the glass
go round
testifying our regard for the sovereign resumed the northern it
canna be understood that we include a the underlings o government we
ought as in duty bound to venerate and obey the maister o the house
bat it is by no means necessary that we should pay a similar
respect to his ox and his ass his manservant and his maidservant
may be had he been at hame on a late occasion o melancholy solemnity
blood wadna hae been spilt and mickle cool and sorrow wad hae been
avoided
we perfectly understand your allusion said one from the group 
lifeguardsmen us now present there were none implicated in the
unfortunate occurrences either that day or a subsequent one yet we
must not silently hear our comrades traduced perhaps then it may be as
well to drop the subject
i canna think o relinquishing a topic discourse answered the
northern replete wi mickle interest merely at your suggestion it
may be ye did your duty in obeying the commands on that lamentable
occasion o your superior officers and it is to be hoped that the duty
o the country towards those with whom originated the mischief will
not be forgotten there is already on record against the honour your
corps a vera serious verdict
here the lifeguardsmen spontaneously started up but the immediate
interposition dashall averted me impending storm while tallyhoho
imitating the generosity his cousin ordered the circulation once
more the bottle to unanimity betwixt the military and the people
harmony thus restored the two friends took their leave amidst the
grateful acknowledgments the company o'shaughnessy swearing on
their departure that doubtless the two strangers were begot in ireland
although they might have come over to england to be born while the
pertinacious northern observed that appearances were after deceitful
although to be sure the twa friends had vera mickle the manners 
perfectly wellbred gentlemen and seem'd forbye to hae a proper sense
o national honor
proceeding into whitehall tallyhoho much admired the statuelike figures
 the mounted sentries in the recesses by the gate the horseguards
the relief had just approached the precision retirement the one
party and advance to its post the other the interesting appearance
 the appropriately caparisoned and steady demeanour the horses
and their instinctive knowledge military duty excited deservedly
prolonged attention
 one would think said tallyhoho that these noble animals are
really actuated by reasoning faculties
hereafter replied dashall you will still more incline to this
opinion when we have an opportunity being present on a cavalry
fieldday in hyde park where manoeuvre will appear to have attained its
acme perfection as much from the wonderful docility the horse as
the discipline the riderl
but hold who have we here our friend sparkle gazing about him with
an eye inquisitive incertitude as if in search lost property
as his two friends approached he seemed bewildered in the labyrinth
 conjecture i have lost my horse he exclaimed in answer to the
inquiry dashall having occasion to stop half an hour at drummond's
i gave the animal in charge an israelite urchin and now neither are
to be seen
casting a look down the street they at last discerned the jew lad
quickly yet carefully leading the horse along with two boys mounted on
its back thoroughly instructed in the maxim get money honestly if
you can but get it by any means young moses had made the most the
present opportunity by letting out the horse at a penny a ride from
charing cross to the horse guards this by his own confession was
the fifteenth trip sparkle highly exasperated was about to apply the
discipline the whip to the shoulders the thrifty speculator when
tallyhoho interceding in his behalf he was released with a suitable
admonition
 not long since some cavalry horses deemed unfit for
further service were sold at tatters's one these
a miller happened to be the purchaser subservient now to
the ignoble purposes burthen the horse one day was
ledwith a sack flour on his back to the next markettown
there while the miller entered a house for a few
moments and the animal quietly waited at the door a
squadron dragoons drew up in an adjacent street forming
by sound trumpet the instant that the miller's horse
heard the wellknown signal it started off with as much
celerity as its burthen admitted and to the great
amusement the troop and astonishment the spectators
took its station in the ranks dressing in line with the
accustomed precision an experienced veteran in the
service and it was with considerable difficulty that the
miller who had now hastened to the spot could induce the
animal to relinquish its military ardour to which it still
appeared to cling with renewed and fond pertinacity
sparkle mounting his recovered charger left his pedestrian
friends for the present to continue their excursion who proceeding up
st martin's lane and admiring that noble edifice the church reached
without other remarkable occurrence the quietude leicester square
close by is barker's panorama an object attraction too prominent to
be passed without inspection they now entered and tallyhoho stood mute
with delight at the astonishing effect the perspective while as if
by the powers enchantment he seemed to have been transported into
other regions amidst scenes rich sublimity in the centre a vast
amphitheatre bounded only by the distant horizon far remote from the
noisy bustle the metropolis he gave full scope to his imagination
and after an hour pleasing reverie left the fascinating delusion
with evident reluctance
emerging once more into the gay world the two associates in search
 real life in london proceeded through covent garden market where
fruit flowers and exotic in profusion invite alike the eye and the
appetite
onwards they reached the classic ground drury where catherine
street descends into the strand
i never said the hon tom dashall pass this spot without a feeling
 veneration the scenes olden times rise on my view and the
shades garrick and our late loss and not less illustrious
sheridan flit before me this was then as now the seat cyprian
indulgence the magnet sensual attraction where feminine youth and
beauty in their most fascinating and voluptuous forms were let out by
the unprincipled procuress and the shrines venus and apollo invited
the votaries each to nocturnal sacrifice
 the avenue to the boxes drury lane theatre was in the
time garrick through vinegar yard in this passage an
old spider better known perhaps by the name a
procuress had spread her web alias opened a bagnio and
obtained a plentiful living by preying on those who
unfortunately or imprudently fell into her clutches those
who are not unacquainted with haddocks will understand the
loose fish alluded to who beset her doors and accosted
with smiles or insults every one that passed it happened
that a noble lord in his way to the theatre with his two
daughters under his arm was most grossly attacked by this
band flaming ministers he immediately went behind the
scenes and insisted on seeing mr garrick to whom he
represented his case and so roused the vengeance the
little manager that he instantly full wrath betook
himself to this unholy sybil
twinchild caius vulcan was their sire full offspring
both healthiness fume and fire
finding her at the mouth her cavern he quickly gave veut
to his rage in the most buskin'd strain and concluded by
swearing that he would have her ousted to this assault she
was not backward in reply but soon convinced him that she
was much more powerful in abusive language than our roscius
though he had recourse in his speech to milton's hellborn
bitch and other phrases similar celebrity whilst she
entirely depended on her own natural resources those to
whom this oratory is not new have no need our reporting
any it and those to whom it is a perfect mystery boast
a state the more gracious and are the more happy in their
ignorance none this rhapsody however although teeming
with blasphemy and abuse had any effect on garrick and he
would have remained unmoved had she not terminated in the
following manner which so excited the laughter the
collected mob and disconcerted the soul richard
that without another word to say he hastily took shelter
in the theatre putting her arms akimbo and letting down
each side her mouth with wonderful expression 
contempt she exclaimed you whipper snapper you oust me
you be d d my house is as good as your's aye and
better too i can come into your's whenever i like and
see the best that you can do for a shilling but dme if
you or any body else shall come into mine for less than a
fifteenpenny negus
 this street and neighbourhood was wont to exhibit nightly
a melancholy proof early infamy here might be seen a prolonged
succession juvenile voluptuaries females many them under
fourteen years age offering themselves to indiscriminate
prostitution in a state verging on absolute nudity alluring the
passengers by every seductive wile to the haunts depravity from
which retreat was seldom effected without pecuniary exaction and
frequently accompanied by personal violence the nuisance has been
partly abated but entirely to remove it would be a task more
difficult accomplishment than that cleansing the augean stable and
would baffle all the labours hercules
this fact observed tallyhoho throws an indelible stain on
metropolitan police
not so answered his companion scarce a day passes without groups 
these unfortunates being held before a magistrate and humanely disposed
 in various ways with the view preventing a recurrence to vicious
habits but in vain the stain is more attributed to the depraved
nature man who first seduces and then casts off to infamy
and indigence the unhappy victim credulity many these wretched
girls would in all probability gladly have abstained from the career
 vice if on their first fall they had experienced the consoling
protection parents or friends but shut out from home exiled from
humanity divested character and without resources no choice is
left other than mendicity or prostitution
the sombre reflections occasioned by these remarks gradually gave way to
those a more enlivening hue as the two friends proceeded along the
strand the various display at the tradesmen's shop windows useful
and ornamental articles the continued bustle the street the
throng passengers every description hurrying on in the activity
 business or more leisurely lounging their way under the impulse 
curiosity the endless succession new faces and frequent occurrence
 interesting incident these united in forming an inexhaustible fund
 amusement and admiration
 hatton garden on saturday no less than fifteen
unfortunate girls all elegantly attired were placed at the
bar charged by caddy the streetkeeper on the foundling
estate with loitering about the neighbourhood for their
nocturnal purposes the constable stated that repeated
complaints had been made to him by many the inhabitants
 the disgraceful practice vast numbers frail ones
who resort every night to brunswick square he had been
therefore instructed to endeavour to suppress the nuisance
about twelve o'clock on friday night while perambulating
the district he found the fifteen prisoners at the bar in
brunswick square at their usual pursuits and all them
were in the act picking up gentlemen he procured
assistance and they were taken into custody and conveyed
to the watchhouse
none the prisoners could deny the charge but expressed
great contrition at being under the painful necessity 
procuring their subsistence in so disgraceful a manner they
were examined individually by the magistrates as to the
origin that brought them to disgrace some from their
admission were farmers daughters and had been decoyed
from their relatives and brought to london and
subsequently deserted by their seducers some were nurserymaids
others girls seduced from boarding schools their
tales were truly distressing some had only been six months
in such infamy others twelve months and some two years and
upwards
the worthy magistrate with much feeling admonished them on
the evil course they were following and pointed out the
means still left for them to return to the paths virtue
and on their severally promising never to appear again in
that quarter they were discharged
passing through temple bar once more said dashall we enter
the dominions another sovereign the moderation being partly occupied by clamorous
butchers with whom this street abounds to redundancy the poet had no
other alternative than that inviting the respectable visitants to
his attic or as the landlord facetiously named the lofty domicile his
first floor down the chimney
real life in london must be seen to be believed the hon tom dashall
and his friend tallyhoho were reared in the lap luxury and never
until now formed an adequate conception the distressing privations
attendant on suffering humanity
with a dejection spirits evidently occasioned by the humiliating
necessity ushering his polished friends into the wretched asylum 
penury the poet led the way with tardy reluctancy while his visitors
regretted every step ascent under the appalling circumstance 
giving pain to adversity yet they felt that to recede would be more
indelicate than to advance
the apartment which they now entered seemed a lumber room for the
reception superfluous or unserviceable furniture containing not
fewer than eleven decayed and mutilated chairs varied description
and the limited space to make the most it in a pecuniary point 
view was encroached upon by three uncurtained beds most
impoverished appearance while exhibiting the ravages time in
divers fractures the dingy walls and ceiling retouched by the trowel
in many places with a lighter shade repairing material bore no unapt
resemblance to the pyebald horse in chigwellstreet calculating on its
utility and probable future use the builder the mansion had given
to this room the appendage a chimney but evidently it had for many
years been unconscious its usual accompaniment fire two windows had
originally admitted the light heaven but to reduce the duty one
was internally blocked up while externally uniformity was preserved a
demolished pane glass in the remaining window close to which stood
a small dilapidated table gave ingress to a current air the
convenient household article denominated a clotheshorse stood against
the wall and several parallel lines cord were stretched across the
room on which to hang wet linen a garret being considered free
access to all the house and the comfort or health its occupant held
in utter derision and contempt
here then
in the worst inn's worst room with cobwebs hung
the walls plaster and the floors dung
entered dashall and his cousin tallyhoho the latter familiarly seating
himself on the rickety remains what had once been an armchair but
now a cripple having lost one its legs the precarious equilibrium
gave way under the unaccustomed shock the contact and the squire
came to the ground to his no small surprise the confusion the poet
and amusement dashall
with many apologies for the awkwardness their very humble
accommodation and grateful expression thanks for the honour
conferred upon him the poet replaced tallyhoho in a firmer seat and a
silence some few moments ensued the two friends being at a loss in
what manner to explain and the poet unwilling to inquire the object 
their visit
dashall began at last by observing that in pursuit the knowledge 
real life in london he and his accompanying friend had met with many
incidents both ludicrous and interesting but that in the present
instance their visit was rather influenced by sympathy than 
curiosity and that where they could be serviceable to the interest 
merit in obscurity they always should be happy in the exercise a
duty so perfectly congenial with their feelings
many years had elapsed since the person to whom these remarks were
addressed had heard the voice consolation and its effect was
instantaneous his usual sombre cast countenance became brightened by
the glow cheerful animation and he even dwelt on the subject his
unfortunate circumstances with jocularity
the elevated proximity a garret he observed to the sublimer
regions has often been resorted to as the roost genius and why
should i the most slender if any literary pretensions complain
and yet my writings scattered amongst the various fugitive periodical
publications this and our sister island if collected together would
form a very voluminous compilation
i have always understood said bob that the quality not the
quantum constituted the fame an author's productions
true sir answered the poet and i meant not the vanity 
arrogating to myself any merit from my writings with reference either
to quantum or quality i alluded to the former as merely proving the
inefficacy mental labour in realizing the necessaries life to an
author whom celebrity declines acknowledging similarly situated it
would appear was the dutchman mentioned by the late doctor walcot
my broder is te poet look
as all te world must please
for he heb wrote py got a 
so big as all this cheese
on the other hand collins hammond and gray wrote each them but
little yet their names will descend to posterity and had gray his
poems the bard and the elegy in a country church yard written
only one and written nothing else he had required no other or better
passport to immortality
 that great and multitudinous writer doctor samuel
johnson the following anecdote is told being one morning
in the library at buckingham house honoured with the
presence royalty the king his late majesty inquired
why he mr johnson did not continue to write may it
please your majesty answered the doctor i think i have
written enough i should have thought so too his
majesty replied if doctor johnson you had not written so
well
 in this opinion the visitants who were both well conversant with
our native literature readily acquiesced
have you never asked dashall thought publishing a volume by
subscription
i meditated such intention answered the poet not long ago drew
up the necessary prospectus with a specimen the poetry and
perambulated the metropolis in search patronage in some few
instances i was successful and though limited the number yet the high
respectability my few subscribers gave me inexpressible satisfaction
several our nobility honoured me with their names and others my
patrons were the very first class literature nevertheless
i encountered much contumelious reception and after an irksome
and unavailing perseverance a month's continuance i was at last
compelled to relinquish all hope success
having then on my list the name a very worthy alderman who lately
filled the civic chair with honour to himself and advantage to his
fellowcitizens i submitted my prospectus in an evil hour to another
alderman a baronet this here and that there notoriety
waiting in his bankinghouse the result my application he
condescended to stalk forth from the holy holies his inner room
with the lofty demeanour conscious importance when in the presence
 his clerks and others doubtless to their great edification and
amusement the following colloquy ensued bearing in his hand my unlucky
prospectus with a respectful epistle which had accompanied it
are you the writer he asked in a magisterial tone this here
letter
i am sir wm unfortunately
then he continued you may take them there papers back again i have
no time to read prospectuses and so mister poet my compliments and
good morning to you
these literally were his words and such was the astounding effect they
produced on my mind that although i had meant to have passed through
the royal exchange i yet in the depth my reverie wandered i knew
not where and before recovering my recollection found myself in the
centre london bridge
 the detail this fact so characteristic rude ungentlemanly
manners and the barbarian ignorance this great man little soul
excited against him with dashall and his friend a mingled feeling 
ridicule contempt and reprobation
real life in london still exclaimed talltho intellect and indigence
in a garret and wealth and ignorance in a bankinghouse i would
at least have given him in deficiency other means the wholesome
castigation reproof
i did said the poet stung to the quick by such unmerited contumely
i retired to my attic and produced a philippic named the recantation
i cannot accommodate you at present with a copy the poem but the
concluding stanzas i can repeat from memory
cs thy house in lombard street
affords thee still employment meet
thy consequence retaining
for there thy partners and thy clerks
must listen to thy sage remarks
subservient uncomplaining
and rob'd in aldermanic gown
with look and language all thy own
thou mak'st thy hearers stare
when this here cause so wisely tried
thou purest with selfapplause aside
to wisely try that there
nor can thy brother its forget
when thou at civic banquet sate
and ask'd heaven a boon
a toast is call'd on thee all eyes
intent when peals laughter rise
a speedy peace and soon
nor yet orthography nor grammar
vain effort on thy pate to hammer
impregnable that fort is
witness thy toast again three cs
for who would think that thou by these
meant cox and king and curtis
cs though scant thy sense yet heaven
to thee the better boon hast given
or wealth then sense despise
and deem not fate's decrees amiss
for still where ignorance is bliss
tis folly to be wise
 bravo exclaimed dashall reissue your prospectus my friend
and we will accelerate with our best interest and influence the
publication your volume let it be dedicated to the hon tom dashall
and his cousin bob tallyhoho in the meanwhile accept this trifle as a
complimentary douceur uniformly given on such occasions and amidst
the varied scenes real life in london i shall frequently recur to
the present as the most gratifying to my feelings
by this the sun was out sight
and darker gloaming brought the night
the benevolent associates now departed pleased with the occurrences 
the day and more than all with the last wherein the opportunity
was afforded them extending consolation and relief to genius in
adversity
chapter xxii
mark
he who would cut the knot that does entwine
and link two loving hearts in unison
may have man's form but at his birth be sure on't
some devil thrust sweet nature's hand aside
ere she had pour'd her balm within his breast
to warm his gross and earthly mould with pity
i know what tis
when worldly knaves step in with silver beards
to poison bliss and pluck young souls asunder
tom and his cousin were surprised the next morning by a visit from
mr mortimer and his friend merrywell whose dismal features and long
visages plainly indicated some unpleasant disaster and tom began to
fear blame would be attached to them for leaving his party at warehouse
lane
pray said merrywell can you tell me where to find your friend
sparkle
indeed replied dashall a little relieved by this question i am not
sparkle's keeper but pray be seated what is the matter is it a duel
do you want a second i know he is a good shot
this levity sir said mortimer is not to be borne the honour a
respectable family is at stake and must be satisfied no doubt you
as his very oldest friend know where he is and i desire you will
immediately inform me or 
sir said dashall who was as averse as unused to be desired by any
person do you know whom you address and that i am in my own house
if you do you have certainly discarded all propriety conduct and
language before you cross'd the threshold
gentlemen said merrywell perhaps some explanation is really
necessary here my friend mortimer speaks under agonized feelings
for which i am sure your good sense will make every allowance miss
mortimer 
miss mortimer exclaimed dashall rising from his seat you
interest me strongly say what miss mortimer
alas said mortimer evidently endeavouring to suppress emotions which
appeared to agitate his whole frame and absorb every mental faculty
we are unable to account for her absence and strongly suspect she is
in company with your friend sparkle can you give us any information
relative to either them
dashall assured them he knew nothing the fugitives but that he
would certainly make every inquiry in his power if possible to find
out sparkle upon which they departed though not without hinting they
expected tom had the power making a search more effectually than
either mortimer or merrywell
egad said tom to tallyhoho this absence sparkle means something
more than i can at present conceive and it appears that we must
now venture forth in search our guide i hope he has taken a good
direction himself
mortimer appears hurt continued bob and i can scarcely wonder at
it
it is a trifle in high life nowadays replied dashall and my life
for it we shall obtain some clue to his mode operation before the
day is out love is a species madness and oftentimes induces
extraordinary movements i have discovered its existence in his breast
for some time past and if he is really with the lady i wonder myself
that he has not given some sort intimation though i know he is very
cautious in laying his plans and very tenacious admitting too many
persons to know his intentions for fear some indiscreet friend
unintentionally frustrating his designs
i apprehend we shall have a wildgoose chase it rejoined bob
it serves however continued tom to diversify our peregrinations
and if it is his pleasure to be in love we will endeavour to chase
pleasure in pursuit the lover and if guided by honourable motives
which i cannot doubt we will wish him all the success he can wish
himself only regretting that we are deprived his agreeable company
still free as air the active mind will rove
and search out proper objects for its love
but that once fix'd tis past the pow'r art
to chase the dear idea from the heart
tis liberty choice that sweetens life
makes the glad husband and the happy wife
 but come let us forth and see how the land lies many persons
obtain all their notoriety from an elopement it makes a noise in the
world and even though frequently announced in our newspapers under
fictitious titles the parties soon become known and are recollected
ever after and some even acquire fame by the insertion a paragraph
announcing an elopement in which they insinuate that themselves are
parties so that an elopement in high life may be considered as one 
the sure roads to popularity
but not always a safe one replied bob
life is full casualties rejoined dashall and you are by
this time fully aware that it requires something almost beyond human
foresight to continue in the line safety while you are in pursuit 
real life in london though it may fairly be said that all the world's
a stage and all the men and women merely passengers still they have
their inside and their outside places and each man in his time meets
with strange adventures it may also very properly be termed a camera
obscura reflecting not merely trees signposts houses c but
the human heart in all its folds its feelings its passions and its
motives in it you may perceive conceit flirting its fan arrogance
adjusting its cravat pedantry perverting its dictionary vacuity
humming a tune vanity humming his neighbour cunning shutting his eyes
while listening to a pedagogue and credulity opening his eyes and ears
willing and anxious to be deceived and duped
it is a strange world indeed said tallyhoho and all that i have
ever heard or seen this london your's is the most extraordinary
part
yes
this world is a wellcover'd table
where guests are promiscuously set
we all eat as long as we're able
and scramble for what we can get 
answered his cousin in fact it is like every thing and at the same
time like nothing 
the world is all nonsense and noise
fantoccini or ombres chinoises
mere pantomime mummery
puppetshow flummery
a magical lantern confounding the sight
like players or puppets we move
on the wires ambition and love
poets write wittily
maidens look prettily
till death drops the curtain
all's over good night
by this time they were at long's where upon inquiry all trace 
sparkle had been lost for two days all was mystery and surprise not so
much that he should be absent as that his servant could give no account
 him which was rather extraordinary tom ascertained however that
no suspicion appeared to have been excited as to miss mortimer and
with commendable discretion avoided expressing a word which could
create such an idea merely observing that most likely he had taken an
unexpected trip into the country and would be heard before the day
was out
on leaving long's however they were met again by mortimer in breathless
anxiety evidently labouring under some new calamity
i am glad i have found you said he addressing himself to dashall
for i am left in this d d wilderness a place without a friend
to speak to
how inquired ton what the d l is the matter with you
why you must know that merry well is gone 
gone where to
to to zounds i've forgot the name the people but two genteel
looking fellows just now very genteel told him he was wanted and must
come
indeed
yes and he told me to find you out and let you know that he must
become a bencher and without more toto walked away with his new
friends leaving me forlorn enough my sister run away my uncle run
after her sparkle absent and merrywell 
in the hands the nabmen i see it all clear enough and you have
given a very concise but comprehensive picture your own situation
but don't despair man you will yet find all right be assured put
yourself under my guidance let the world wag as it will it is useless
to torment yourself with things you cannot prevent or cure
the right life is to live and be jolly
 mortimer scarcely knew how to relish this advice and seemed to
doubt within himself whether it was meant satirically or feelingly till
dashall whispered in his ear a caution not to betray the circumstances
that had transpired for his sister's sake but continued he i
never suffer these things which are by no means uncommon in london
to interfere with my pursuits though we are all somewhat at a loss
however as the post is in by this time some news may be expected and
we will call at home before we proceed any further where do you think
the colonel is gone to
heaven only knows replied mortimer the whole family is in an uproar
 surmise and alarm what may be the it i know not
a pretty breeze master sparkle has kick'd up indeed continued tom
but i have for some time noticed an alteration in him he always was
a gay trump and whenever i find him seriously inclined i suspect
some mischief brewing for rapid transitions always wear portentous
appearances and your serious files are generally sly dogs my life
for it they have stolen a march upon your uncle queered some country
parson and are by this time snugly stowed away in the harbour 
matrimony as for merrywell i dare be sworn his friends will take care
 him
expectation was on tiptoe as dashall broke the seal a letter that
was handed to him on arrival at home mortimer was on the fidget and
tallyhoho straining his neck upon the full stretch anxiety to hear
the news when dashall burst into a laugh but in which neither the
others could join in consequence not knowing the cause it in a
few minutes however the mystery was in some degree explained
here said tom is news extraordinary news an official dispatch
from headquarters but without any information as to where the tents
are pitched it is but a short epistle he then read aloud
dear dashall
please inform the mortimer family and friends that all's well
your's truly
c sparkle
then handing the laconic epistle to mortimer i trust said he you
will now be a little more at ease
 mortimer eagerly examined the letter for the postmark but was
not able to make out from whence it came
i confess said he i am better satisfied than i was but am yet at
a loss to judge the motives which have induced them to pursue so
strange a course
the motive cried tom that may be easily explained and i doubt
not but you will find although it may at present appear a little
mysterious sparkle will be fully able to shew cause and produce effect
he is however a man honour and property and most likely we may by
this time congratulate you upon the change your sister's name what
a blaze it will make and she will now most certainly become a sparkling
subject hang it man don't look so dull upon a bright occasion
to prove pleasure but pain some have hit on a project
we're duller the merrier we grow
exactly the same unaccountable logic
that talks cold fire and warm snow
for me born by nature
for humour and satire
i sing and i roar and i quaff
each muscle i twist it
i cannot resist it
a finger held up makes me laugh
for since pleasure's joy's parent and joy begets mirth
should the subtlest casuist or sophist on earth
contradict me i'd call him an ass and a calf
and boldly insist once for all
that the only criterion pleasure's to laugh
and sing tol de rol loi de rol lol
this mirth dash all's did not seem to be in consonance with the
feelings mortimer who hastily took his departure
come said tom to his cousin having gained some information
respecting one friend we will now take a stroll through temple bar and
have a peep at merrywell he may perhaps want assistance in his present
situation though i will answer for it he is in a place perfect
security
how said bob what do you mean
mean why the traps have nibbled him he is arrested and gone to a
lockup shop a place mere accommodation for gentlemen to take up
their abode for the purpose arranging their affairs and
where they can uninterruptedly make up their minds whether to give
bail put in appearance and defend the suit or take a trip to abbott's
priory become a three months student in the college art and
undergo the fashionable ceremony whitewashing
i begin to understand you now said bob and the only difference
between our two friends is that one has willingly put on a chain for
life 
and the other may in all probability continued tom have to chaff his
time away with a chum perhaps not quite so agreeable though it really
is possible to be very comfortable if a man can reconcile himself to
the loss liberty even in durance vile
by this time they were walking leisurely along piccadilly
and marching without any cumbersome load
they mark'd every singular sight on the road
who is that meagre looking man and waddling woman who just passed us
inquired tallyhoho
an old bencher was the reply there you see all that is left a
man haut ton one who has moved in the highest circles but alas
bad company and bad play have reduced him to what he now is he has cut
up and turn'd down very well among the usurers and attornies but it is
impossible to say him as his sirloin a wife for she cannot be
called a rib or at all events a spare rib that there is any thing like
cut and come again the poor wornout exquisite tack'd himself to his
lady to enable him to wipe out a long score and she determined on
taking him for better for worse after a little rural felicity in a walk
to have her fortune told by a gipsy at wormwood he is now crippled in
pocket and person and wholly dependent upon bounty for the chance 
prolonging a miserable existence his game is up but what is life but a
game at which every one is willing to play one wins and another loses
why there have been as many moves among titled persons kings queens
bishops lords and knights within the last century as there are in a
game at chess pawns have been taken and restored in all classes
from the sovereign who pawns or loses his crown to the lady whose
reputation is in pawn and becomes at last not worth half a crown
shuffling cutting dealing out and dealing in double dealing
and double faces have long been the order the day some men's cards
are all trumps whilst others have carte blanche some honours count
whilst others stand for nothing for instance did not the little man
who cast up his final accounts a short time back at st helena like a
corsican conjurer shuffle and cut about among kings and queens knaves
and asses aces i mean dealing out honours when he liked and taking
trumps as he thought fit did he not deal and take up again almost ashe
pleased having generally an honour in his sleeve to be played at
command or un roi dans le marche by which cheating it was scarcely
possible for any one to get fair play with him till flushed by
success and not knowing how to bear his prosperity he played too
desperately and too long the tables were turned upon him and his
enemies cheated him first his liberty and ultimately his life
at this moment tallyhoho who was listening in close attention to his
cousin struck his foot against a brown paper parcel which rolled before
him hallo exclaimed he what have we here somebody has dropped a
prize
it is mine sir said an old woman dropping them a curtsey with a
smile which shone through her features though thickly begrimed with
snuff
a bite said tom
i dropp'd it from my pocket sir just now
and pray inquired tom what does it contain picking it up
snuff sir was the reply a kind goodhearted gentleman gave it tome
god bless him and bless your honour too with an additional smile
and a still lower curtsey
upon examining the paper which had been broken by the kick tom
perceived that by some magic or other the old woman's snuff had become
sugar
zounds said he they have played some trick upon you and given you
brimstone instead snuff or else you are throwing dust in our eyes
the parcel which contained a sample sugar was carefully rolled up
again and tied then dropped to be found by any body else who chose to
stoop for it
this said dashall does not turn out to be what i first expected
for the practices ring and money droppings have at various
times been carried on with great success and to the serious injury
 the unsuspecting the persons who generally apply themselves to this
species cheating are no other than gamblers who ingeniously contrive
by dropping a purse or a ring to draw in some customer with a view to
induce him to play and notwithstanding their arts have frequently been
exposed we every now and then hear some flat being done by these
sharps and indeed there are constantly customers in london to be had
one way or another
then you had an idea that that parcel was a bait this kind
rejoined bob
i did replied his cousin but it appears to be a legitimate letter
from some industrious mechanic to his friend and is a curious specimen
 epistolary correspondence and you perceive there was a person ready
to claim it which conspired rather to confirm my suspicions being a
little in the style the gentry i have alluded to they vary their
mode proceeding according to situation and circumstance your
moneydropper contrives to find his own property as if by chance
he picks up the purse with an exclamation hallo what have we
here zounds if here is not a prize i'm in rare luck today ha
ha ha let's have a peep at it it feels heavy and no doubt is worth
having while he is examining its contents up comes his confederate
who claims a share on account having been present at the finding
nay nay replies the finder you are not in it this gentleman is
the only person that was near me was not you sir by this means the
novice is induced to assent or perhaps assert his prior claim the
finder declares
 the practice ringdropping is not wholly confined to
london as the following paragraph from the glasgow courier
a very short time ago will sufficiently prove on monday
afternoon when three highland women who had been employed
at a distance from home in the harvest were returning to
their habitations they were accosted by a fellow who had
walked out a short way with them till he picked up a pair
 earrings and a key for a watch the fellow politely
informed the females that they should have half the value 
the articles as they were in his company when they were
found while they were examining them another fellow came
up who declared at once they were gold and worth at least
thirty shillings after some conversation the women were
induced to give fifteen shillings for the articles and came
and offered them to a watchmaker for sale when they
learned to their mortification that they were not worth
eighteen pence
 that sooner than have any dispute about it he will divide the
contents in three parts recommends an adjournment to a publichouse in
the neighbourhood to wet the business and drink over their good luck
this being consented to the leading points are accomplished the
purse course is found to contain counterfeit money flashscreens or
fleetnotes and the division cannot well be made without change can
be procured now comes the touchstone the countryman for such they
generally contrive to inveigle is perhaps in cash having sold his hay
or his cattle tells them he can give change which being understood
the draughtboard cards or la bagatelle are introduced and as the
job is a good one they can afford to sport some their newlyacquired
wealth in this way they drink and play and fill their grog again the
countryman bets if he loses he is called upon to pay if he wins tis
added to what is coming to him out the purse
if after an experiment or two they find he has but little money or
fight shy they bolt that is brush off in quick time leaving him to
answer for the reckoning but if he is what they term wellbreeches
and full cash they stick to him until he is cleaned out make him
drunk and if he turns restive they mill him if he should be an
easy cove he perhaps give them change for their flash notes or
counterfeit coin and they leave him as soon as possible highly pleased
with his fancied success while they laugh in their sleeves at the dupe
 their artifice
and is it possible inquired tallyhoho
can such things be and overcome us
like a summer's cloud
not without our special wonder continued dashall but such things
have been practised then again your ringdroppers or practises 
the sawney rig are more cunning in their manoeuvres to turn their wares
into the ready blunt the pretending to find a ring being one the
meanest and least profitable exercises their ingenuity it forms a
part their art to find articles much more
 flashscreens or fleetnotes forged notes
 cleaned out having lost all your money
 easy cove one whom there is no difficulty in gulling
 ready blunt cash in hand
 value such as rich jewelry broaches earrings necklaces set
with diamonds pearls c sometimes made into a paper parcel at others
in a small neat red morocco case in which is stuck a bill parcels
giving a highflown description the articles and with an extravagant
price proceeding nearly in the same way as the moneydroppers with the
dupe the finder proposes as he is rather short seven to
swap his share for a comparatively small part the value stated in
the bill parcels and if he succeeds in obtaining onetenth that
amount in hard cash his triumph is complete for upon examination the
diamonds turn out to be nothing but paste the pearls fishes eyes and
the gold is merely polished brass gilt and altogether no value
but this cannot be discovered beforehand because the bilk is in a
hurry can't spare time to go to a shop to have the articles valued
but assures his intended victim that as they found together he should
like to smack the bit without blowing the gap and so help
him g d the thing wants no buttering up because he is willing to
give his share for such a trifle
 seven a flash term for money
 swap to make an exchange to barter one article for
another
 a swindler or cheat
 smack the bit to share the booty
 blowing the gap making any thing known
 buttering up praising or flattering
this conversation was suddenly interrupted by a violent crash just
behind them as they passed drury lane theatre in their way through
russel court and bob upon turning to ascertain from whence such
portentous sounds proceeded discovered that he had brought all the
potentates the holy alliance to his feet the alexanders the
caesar the buonaparte shakespeare addison and popes lay strewed
upon the pavement in one undistinguished heap while a poor italian lad
with tears in his eyes gazed with indescribable anxiety on the shapeless
ruin vat shall me do dat man knock him down all broke you
pay oh mine god vat shall do this appeal was made to dashall and
tallyhoho the latter whom the poor italian seemed to fix upon as the
author his misfortune in upsetting his board plaster images and
although he was perfectly unconscious the accident the appeal the
vender great personages had its desired effect upon them both and
 finding themselves quickly surrounded by spectators they gave
him some silver and then pursued their way
these men said dashall are generally an industrious and hardliving
people they walk many miles in the course a day to find sale for
their images which they will rather sell at any price than carry back
with them at night and it is really wonderful how they can make a
living by their traffic
ha ha ha said a coarse spoken fellow following how the carman
duck diddled the dandies just now did you twig how he queered the coves
out seven bob for what was not worth thrums the yelper 
did his duty well and finger'd the white wool in good style i'm
d d if he was not up to slum and he whited their wattles with
the velvet and floored the town toddlers easy enough
how do you mean said his companion
why you know that foreign blade is an ould tyke about this quarter and
makes a good deal money many a twelve does he get by buying
up broken images persons who sell them by wholesale and he course
gets them for little or nothing then what does he do but dresses out
his board to give them the best appearance he can and toddles into
the streets touting for a good customer the first genteel bit 
flash he meets that he thinks will dub up the possibles he dashes
down the board breaks all the broken heads and appeals in a pitiful
way for remuneration for his loss so that nine times out ten he gets
some johnnyraw or other to stump up the rubbish
zounds said dashall these fellows are smoking us and in the midst
 my instructions to guard you against the abuses the metropolis we
have ourselves become the dupes an impostor
 thrums a flash term for threepence
 the yelper a common term given to a poor fellow subject
who makes very pitiful lamentations on the most trifling
accidents
 white wool silver
 twelve a shilling
 touting is to be upon the sharp look out
 to dub up the possibles to stand the nonsense are nearly
synonymous and mean will pay up any demand rather than be
detained
 well said tallyhoho it is no more than a practical
illustration your own observation that it is scarcely possible for
any person to be at all times secure from the arts and contrivances 
your ingenious friends the londoners though i confess i was little in
expectation finding you as an old practitioner so easily let in
it is not much to be wondered at continued tom for here we are in
the midst the very persons whose occupations if such they may be
termed ought most to be avoided for covent garden and drury lane
with their neighbourhoods are at all times infested with swindlers
sharpers whores thieves and depredators all descriptions for ever
on the look out it is not long since a man was thrown from a twopair
 stairs window in charles street which is just by having been
decoyed into a house ill fame by a cyprian and this in a situation
within sight the very police office itself in bow street
huzza ha ha ha there he goes vociferated by a variety voices
now called their attention and put an to their conversation and
the appearance a large concourse people running up drury lane
engrossed their notice as they approached the other russel court
on coming up with the crowd they found the cause the vast assemblage
 persons to be no other than a quakers decorated with a tricoloured
cockade who was
 a circumstance a truly alarming and distressing nature
to which dashall alluded in this place was recently made
known to the public in the daily journals and which should
serve as a lesson to similar adventurers
it appeared that a young man had been induced to enter a
house ill fame in charles street covent garden by one
 its cyprian inmates to whom he gave some money in order
for her to provide them with supper that upon her return
he desired to have the difference between what he had given
and what she had expended returned to him which being
peremptorily refused he determined to leave the house on
descending the staircase for which purpose he was met by
some men with whom he had a violent struggle to escape
they beat and bruised him most unmercifully and afterwards
threw him from a twopair stairs window into the street
where he was found by the watchman with his skull fractured
and in a state insensibility we believe all attempts
have hitherto proved fruitless to bring the actual
perpetrator or perpetrators this diabolical deed to
punishment
 bowstreet thursday morning an eccentric personage who
has for some time been seen about the streets the
metropolis in the habit a quaker and wearing the tricoloured
cockade in his broad white hat made his appearance
at the door this office and presenting a large packet to
one the officers desired him in a tone authority to
lay it instantly before the magistrate the magistrate g
r minshull esq having perused this singular paper
inquired for the person who brought it and in the next
moment a young man in the garb a quaker with a broadbrimmed
peacefullooking drabcoloured beaver on his
head surmounted by a furious tricoloured cockade was
brought before him this strange anomalous personage
having placed himself very carefully directly in front 
the bench smiled complacently upon his worship and the
following laconic colloquy ensued forthwith
magistrate did you bring this letter
quaker thou hast said it
magistratewhat is your object in bringing it
quaker merely to let thee know what is going on in the
world and moreover being informed that if i came to thy
office i should be taken into custody i was desirous to
ascertain whether that information was true
magistrate then i certainly shall not gratify you by
ordering you into custody
quaker thou wilt do as seemeth right in thy eyes i assure
thee i have no inclination to occupy thy time longer than is
profitable to us and therefore i will retire whenever thou
shalt signify that my stay is unpleasant to thee
magistrate why do you wear your hat are you a quaker
quaker thou mayest it but that is not my sole motive for
wearing it to be plain with thee i wear it because i chose
to do so canst thee tell me any law which compels me
to take it off
magistrate i'll tell you what friend i would seriously
recommend you to retire from this place as speedily as
possible
quaker i take thy advice farewell
thus ended this comical conversation and the eccentric
friend immediately departed in peace
the brother the above person attended at the office on
saturday and stated that the quaker is insane that he was
proprietor an extensive farm near relate in surrey for
some years but that in may last his bodily health being
impaired he was confined for some time and on his recovery
it was found that his intellects were affected and he was
put under restraint but recovered some time since he
absconded from relate and his friends were unable to
discover him until they saw the account his eccentricities
in the newspapers mr squire was desirous if he
made his appearance again at the office he should be
detained the magistrate as a cause for the detention 
the quaker swore the brother to these facts about three
o'clock the quaker walked up bowstreet when an officer
conducted him to the presence the magistrate who
detained him and at seven o'clock delivered him into the
care his brother
 very quietly walking with a police officer and exhibiting a
caricature himself mounted on a velocipede and riding over
corruption c it was soon ascertained that he had accepted an
invitation from one the magistrates bow street to pay him a visit
as he had done the day before and was at that moment going before him
i apprehend he is a little cracked said tom but however that maybe
he is a very harmless sort person but come we have other game
in view and our way lies in a different direction to his
clothes sir any clothes today said an importunate young fellow at
the corner one the courts who at the same time almost obstructed
their passage
making their way as quickly as they could from this very pressing
personage who invited them to walk in
this said tom is what we generally call a barker i believe the
title originated with the brokers in moorfields where men this
description parade in the fronts their employers houses incessantly
pressing the passengers to walk in and buy household furniture as they
do clothes in rosemary lane seven dials field lane houndsditch and
several other parts the town ladies dresses also used to be barked
in cranbourn alley and the neighbourhood leicester fields however
the nuisance has latterly in some measure abated the shopwomen in that
part content themselves nowadays by merely inviting strangers to look
at their goods but barkers are still to be found stationed at the
doors mock auctions who induce company to assemble by bawling walk
in the auction is now on or just going to begin these mock
auctions there have been many opened an evening under the imposing
glare brilliant gas lights which throws an unusual degree lustre
upon the articles put up for sale it is not however very difficult to
distinguish them from the real ones notwithstanding they assume all the
exterior appearances genuineness even up to advertisements in the
newspapers purporting to be held in the house a person lately gone
away under embarrassed circumstances or deceased they are denominated
mock auctions because no real intention exists on the part the
sellers to dispose their articles under a certain price previously
fixed upon which although it may not be high is invariably more than
they are actually worth besides which they may be easily discovered by
the anxiety they evince to show the goods to strangers at
the moment they enter never failing to bestow overstrained
panegyrics upon every lot they put up and asking repeatedly what
shall we say for this article a better cannot be produced and
promising if not approved when purchased to change it the
auctioneer has a language suited to all companies and according to his
view a customer can occasionally jest bully or perplex him into
a purchase the goods must be sold at what they will fetch and
he declares notwithstanding among his confederates who stand by as
bidders they are run up beyond the real value in order to catch a
flat that the present bidding can never have paid the manufacturer
for his labour
in such places various articles silver plate glass and household
furniture are exposed to sale but generally made up damaged
materials and slight workmanship little intrinsic value for the
selfsame purpose as the razorseller states
friend cried the razorman i'm no knave
as for the razors you have bought
upon my soul i never thought
that they would shave
not shave quoth hodge with wond'ring eyes
and voice not much unlike an indian yell
what were they made for then you dog he cries
made quoth the fellow with a smile to sell
passing the white horse yard here continued tom in this
yard and the various courts and alleys which lead into it reside
numerous girls in the very lowest state prostitution and it is
dangerous even in the day time to pass their habitations at all
events very dangerous to enter any one them do you see the crowd
 squalid halfclad and halfstarved creatures that surround the old
woman at the corner observe that young thing without a stocking is
stealing along with a bottle in one hand and a gown in the other she is
going to put the latter up the spout with her
 up the spout or up the five are synonymous in their
import and mean the act pledging property with a
pawnbroker for the loan money most probably derived from
the practice having a long spout which reaches from the
top the house the pawnbroker where the goods are
deposited for safety till redeemed or sold to the shop
where they are first received through which a small bag is
dropped upon the ringing a bell which conveys the
tickets or duplicates to a person above stairs who upon
finding them unless too bulky saves himself the trouble
and loss time coming down stairs by more readily
conveying them down the spout
 accommodating uncle in order to obtain a little the
enlivening juice the juniper to fill the former
 uncle sometimes called the ferret or the flint cant
terms for pawnbroker though many these gentlemen now
assume the more reputable appellation silversmiths they
are willing to lend money upon all sorts articles 
household furniture linen plate wearing apparel
jewellery c with a certainty making a very handsome
profit upon the money so circulated
there are in this metropolis upwards two hundred and
thirty pawnbrokers and in some cases they are a useful and
serviceable class people and although doubtless many 
them are honest and reputable persons there are still among
them a class sharpers and swindlers who obtain licences
to carry on the business and bring disgrace upon the
respectable part the profession every species fraud
which can add to the distresses those who are compelled
to raise temporary supplies money is resorted to and for
which purpose there are abundance opportunities in many
instances however the utility these persons in
preventing a serious sacrifice property cannot be
denied for by advancing to tradesmen and mechanics
temporary loans upon articles value at a period 
necessity an opportunity redeeming them is afforded
when by their industrious exertions their circumstances are
improved many them however are receivers stolen
goods and under cover their licence do much harm to
the public indeed the very easy mode raising money by
means the pawnbrokers operates as an inducement or at
least an encouragement to every species vice the
fraudulent tradesman by their means is enabled to raise
money on the goods his creditors the servant to pledge
the property his employer and the idle or profligate
mechanic to deposit his working tools or his work in an
unfinished state many persons in london are in the habit 
pawning their apparel from monday morning till saturday
night when they are redeemed in order to make a decent
appearance on the next day in low neighbourhoods and among
loose girls much business is done by pawnbrokers to good
advantage and considerable emolument is derived from women
 the town the articles they offer to pledge are generally
 the most costly nature and the pilfering the night
are usually placed in the hands an uncle the next
morning and the wary moneylenders fully acquainted with
their necessities just lend what they please by which
means they derive a wonderful profit from the almost
certainty these articles never being redeemed
the secresy with which a pawnbroker's business is conducted
though very proper for the protection the honest and
wellmeaning part the population to shield them from an
exposure which might perhaps prove fatal to their business or
credit admits great room for fraud on the part the
moneylender more particularly as it respects the interest
allowed upon the pawns many persons are willing to pay any
charge made rather than expose their necessities by
appearing before a magistrate and acknowledging they have
been concerned in such transactions
persons who are in the constant habit pawning are
generally known by the pawnbrokers in most instances
governed by their will and compelled to take and pay just
what they please again much injury arises from the want 
care in the pawnbroker to require a proper account from the
pledgers the manner in which the goods offered have been
obtained as duplicates are commonly given upon fictitious
names and residences
notwithstanding the care and attention usually paid to the
examination the articles received as pledges these
gentlemen are sometimes to be duped by their customers we
remember an instance an elderly man who was in the habit
 bringing a dutch clock frequently to a pawnbroker to
raise the wind and for safety generally left it in a large
canvass bag till he became so regular a customer that his
clock and bag were often left without inspection and as it
was seldom deposited for long together it was placed in
some handy nook the shop in order to lie ready for
redemption this system having been carried on for sometime
no suspicion was entertained the old man upon one
occasion however the pawnbroker's olfactory nerves were
saluted with a smell a most unsavoury nature for which
he could by no means account day after day passed and no
discovery was made till at length he determined to overhaul
every article in his shop and if possible discover the
source a nuisance which appeared rather to increase than
abate in doing which to his utter astonishment he found
the old man's dutch clock transformed into a sheep's head
enclosed in a small box similar in shape and size to that 
the clock it will scarcely be necessary to add that being
in the heat summer the sheep's head when turned out was
in a putrid state and as green as grass the pawnbroker
declared the old gentleman's works were out repair that
he himself was out tune and eventually pledged himself
never to be so taken in again after all however it must
be acknowledged that my uncle is a very accommodating man
my uncle's the man i've oft said it before
who is ready and willing to open his door
tho some on the question may harbour a doubt
he's a mill to grind money which i call a spout
derry down
he has three golden balls which hang over his door
which clearly denote that my uncle's not poor
he has money to lend and he's always so kind
he will lend it to such as leave something behind
derry down
if to music inclin'd there's no man can so soon
set the hooks your gamut to excellent tune
all his tickets are prizes most carefully booked
and your notes must be good or you're presently hook'd
derry down
shirts shoes and flatirons hats towels and ruffs
to him are the same as rich satins or stuffs
from the pillows you lay on chairs tables or sacks
he'll take all you have to the togs on your backs
derry down
then ye who are needy repair to your friend
who is ready and willing your fortunes to mend
he's a purse full rhino and that's quite enough
tho short in his speech he can shell out short stuff
derry down
what a blessing it is in this place renown
to know that we have such an uncle in town
in all cases degrees in all places and stations
tis a good thing to know we've such friendly relations
derry down
surely said tallyhoho no person could possibly be inveigled by her
charms
 they are not very blooming just now d some agreeable and intelligent company in his house
this proposition being agreed to and directions given accordingly by
merrywell to prepare dinner our party gave loose to opinions life
observations on men and mariners exactly as they presented themselves
to the imagination each speaker and merrywell evidently proved
himself a close observer character
places like this said he are generally inhabited by the profligate
 fashion the ingenious artist or the plodding mechanic the first
is one who cares not who suffers so he obtains a discharge from his
incumbrances having figured away for some time in the labyrinths 
folly and extravagance till finding the needful run taper he yields
to john doe and richard roe as a matter course passes through his
degrees in the study the laws by retiring to the fleet or king's
bench and returns to the world with a clean face and an increased
stock information to continue his career the second are men who
have heads to contrive and hands to execute improvements in scientific
pursuits probably exhausting their time their health and their
property in the completion their projects but who are impeded in
their progress and compelled to finish their intentions in durance
vile by the rapacity their creditors and the last are persons
subjected to all the casualties trade and the arts the former and
unable to meet the peremptory demands those they are indebted
to but they seldom inhabit these places long unless they can pay
well for their accommodations money is therefore as useful in a
lockuphouse or a prison as in any other situation life
money with the generality people is every thing it is the
universal talisman there is magic in its very name it ameliorates all
the miserable circumstances life and the sound it may almost be
termed life itself it is the balm the comfort and the restorative
it must indeed be truly mortifying to the opulent to observe that the
attachment their dependents and even the apparent esteem their
friends arises from the respect paid to riches the vulgar herd bow
with reverence and respect before the wealthy but it is in fact
the money and not the individual which they worship doubtless a
philosophic tallowchandler would hasten from the contemplation the
starry heavens to vend a farthing rush light and it therefore cannot
be wondered at that the sheriffsofficer who serves you with a writ
because you have not money enough to discharge the just demands against
you should determine at least to get as much as he can out you and
when he finds your resources exhausted that he should remove you to the
common receptacle debtors which however cannot be done to your own
satisfaction without some money for if you wish a particular place 
residence or the most trifling accommodation there are fees to pay
even on entering a prison
in that case then said tallyhoho a man is actually obliged to pay forgoing
to a prison
precisely so unless he is willing to mingle with the very lowest order
 society but come we will walk into the coffeeroom and take a view
 the inmates
upon entering this which was a small dark room they heard a great
number voices and in one corner found several the prisoners
surrounding a bagatelleboard and playing for porter ale c in
another corner was a young man in close conversation with an
attorney and a little further distant was a hardfeatured man taking
instructions from the turnkey how to act here was a poor player who
declared he would take the benefit the act and afterwards take a
benefit at the theatre to reestablish himself there a poet racking
his imagination and roving amidst the flowers fancy giving a few
touches by way finish to an ode to liberty with the produce
 which he indulged himself in a hope obtaining the subject his
muse the conversation was a mingled nature the vociferations the
bagatelleplayers the whispers the attorney and his client and the
declarations the prisoner to the turnkey that he would be d d
if he did not serve em out and floor the whole boiling them
were now and then interrupted by the notes a violin playing the most
lively airs in an animated and tasteful style the performer however was
not visible but appeared to be so near that merrywell who was a great
lover music beckoned his friends to follow him they now entered a
small yard at the back the house the usual promenade those who
resided in it and found the musician seated on one the benches
which were continued nearly round the yard and which itself formed
a panorama rural scenery here was the bubbling cascade and the lofty
fountain there the shady grove majestic poplars and the meandering
stream glittering in the resplendent lustre a rising sun the waving
foliage however and the bubbling fountain were not to be seen or heard
as these beauties were only to be contemplated in the labours the
painter but to make up for the absence these with the harmony
 the birds and the rippling the stream the musician was
endeavouring like an arcadian shepherd with his pipe to make the
woods resound with the notes his fiddle surrounded by some his
fellowprisoners who did not fail to applaud his skill and reward his
kindness by supplying him with rosin as they termed it which was by
handing him the heavywet as often as they found his elbow at rest in
one place was to be seen a butcher who upon his capture was visited by
his wife with a child in her arms upon whom the melody seemed to have
no effect she was an interesting and delicatelooking woman whose
agitation spirits upon so melancholy an occasion were evidenced by
streaming tears from a pair lovely dark eyes and the butcher as
evidently forgetful his usual calling was sympathising with and
endeavouring to soothe her into composure and fondling the child in
another a person who had the appearance an halfpay officer with
hessian boots blue pantaloons and a black silk handkerchief sat with
his arms folded almost without taking notice what was passing around
him though a rough sailor with a pipe in his mouth occasionally 
enlivened the scene by accompanying the notes the musician with a
characteristic dance which he termed a hornspike
it was a fine scene real life and after taking a few turns in the
gardens the lockup or sponginghouse they returned to merrywell's
apartments which they had scarcely entered when the tandem drew up to
the door
more company said merry well
and perhaps the more the merrier replied tom
that is as it may prove was the reply for the company this
house ace as various at times as can be met with in any other situation
however this appears to wear the form one our fashionable
highlife gentlemen but appearances are often deceitful we shall
perhaps hear more him presently he may turn out to be one the
prodigals who calculate the duration life at about ten years that
is to have a short life and a merry one
that seems to me to be rather a short career too exclaimed bob
nay nay that is a long calculation for it frequently cannot be made
to last half the number in the first place the pupil learns every kind
 extravagance which he practises en maitre the two next years these
make an his fortune he lives two more on credit established
while his property lasted the next two years he has a letter 
licence and contrives to live by ways and means for he has grown
comparatively knowing then he marries and the wife has the honour
 discharging his debts her fortune proving just sufficient for the
purpose then he manages to live a couple years more on credit and
retires to one his majesty's prisons
by this time mr safebind made his appearance and with great politeness
inquired if the gentlemen were accommodated in the way they wished
upon being assured this and requested to take a seat after some
introductory conversation he gave them the following account himself
and his business
we have brought nine gemmen into the house this morning and though i
say it no german goes out that would have any objection to come into it
again
tallyhoho shrugged up his shoulders in a way that seemed to imply a doubt
 for continued he a german that is a german shall always find
genteel treatment here i always acts upon honour and secrecy and if as
how a german can't bring his affairs into a comfortable shape here why
then he is convey'd away without exposure that is if he understands
things
with assurances this kind the veracity which no one present could
doubt they were entertained for some time by their loquacious host
who having the gift the gab would probably have continued long
in the same strain important information when dinner was placed on
the table and they fell to with good appetites seeming almost to have
made use the customary grace among theatricals
the table cleared the frequent glass goes round and joke and song and
merriment abound
your house said dashall might well be termed the temple the
arts since their real votaries are so frequently its inhabitants
very true sir said safebind and as the poet observes it is as
often graced by the presence the devotees to the sciences in point
 company he says we may almost call it multum in pavo or the camera
obscura life there are at this time within these walls a learned
alchymist two students in anatomy and a physician a poet a player
and a musician the player is an adept at mimicry the musician a good
player and the poet no bad stick at a rhyme all anxious to turn their
talents to good account and when mingled together productive
 harmony though the situation they are in at present is rather
discordant to their feelings but then you know tis said that discord
is the soul harmony and they knocked up a duet among themselves
yesterday which i thought highly amusing
i am fond music said merry well do you think they would take a
glass wine with us
 gift the gab fluency speech
 it is a very common thing among the minor theatricals
when detained at rehearsals c to adjourn to some
convenient room in the neighbourhood for refreshment and
equally common for them to commence operations in a truly
dramatic way by exclaiming to each other in the language
 shakespeare
come on macbeth come on macduff
and d d be he who first cries hold enough
 most readily no doubt was the reply i will introduce them
in a minute thus saying he left the room and in a very few minutes
returned with the three votaries apollo who soon joined in the
conversation upon general subjects the player now discovered his
loquacity the poet his sagacity and the musician his pertinacity
for he thought no tones so good as those produced by himself nor no
notes we beg pardon none but bank notes equal to his own
it will be sufficient for our present purpose to add that the
bottle circulated quickly and what with the songs the poet the
recitations the player and the notes the fiddler time which
perfects all intellectual ability and also destroys the most stupendous
monuments art brought the sons apollo under the table and
admonished dashall and his cousin to depart which they accordingly
did after a promise to see their friend merry well in his intended new
quarters
chapter xxiv
all nations boast some men nobler mind
their scholars heroes benefactors kind
and britain has her share among the rest
 men the wisest boldest and the best
yet we knaves and fools have ample share
and eccentricities beyond compare
full many a life is spent and many a purse
in mighty nothings or in something worse
the next scene which tom was anxious to introduce to his cousin's
notice was that a political dinner but while they were preparing for
departure a letter arrived which completely satisfied the mind the
hon tom dashall as to the motives and views their friend sparkle
and ran as follows
dear dashall
having rivetted the chains matrimony on the religious anvil 
gretna green i am now one the happiest fellows in existence
my election is crowned with success and i venture to presume all
afterpetitions will be rejected as frivolous and vexatious the once
lovely miss mortimer is now the ever to be loved mrs sparkle i shall
not now detain your attention by an account our proceedings or
adventures on the road we shall have many more convenient opportunities
 indulging in such details when we meet replete as i can assure you
they are with interest
i have written instructions to my agent in town for the immediate
disposal my paternal estate in wiltshire and mean hereafter to take
up my abode on one i have recently purchased in the neighbourhood 
belville hall where i anticipate many pleasurable opportunities
 seeing you and our friend tallyhoho surrounding my hospitable and
hereafter family board we shall be there within a month as we mean
to reach our place destination by easy stages and look about us
please remember me to all old friends in town and believe as ever
your's truly
charles sparkle
carlisle
 the receipt this letter and its contents were immediately
communicated to young mortimer who had already received some
intelligence a similar nature which had the effect allaying
apprehension and dismissing fear for his sister's safety the mysterious
circumstances were at once explained and harmony was restored to the
previously agitated family
i am truly glad this information said tom and as we are at
present likely to be politically engaged we cannot do less than take a
bumper or two after dinner to the health and happiness the candidate
who so emphatically observes he has gained his election and in the
true language every patriot declares he is the happiest man alive
notwithstanding the rivets by which he is bound
you are inclined to be severe said tallyhoho
by no means replied dashall the language the letter certainly
seems a little in consonance with my observation but i am sincere in my
good wishes towards the writer and his amiable wife come we must now
take a view other scenes hear long speeches drink repeated bumpers
and shout with lungs leather till the air resounds with peals 
approbation
we shall there see and hear the great men the nation or at least
who are such in their own estimation
great in the name a patriot father bore
behold a youth promise boldly soar
outstrip his fellows clambering height extreme
and reach to eminence almost supreme
with wellworn mask and virtue's fair pretence
and all the art smoothtongued eloquence
he talks wise reform rights most dear
till half the nation thinks the man sincere
hey day said tallyhoho who do you apply this to
those who find the cap fit may wear it was the reply 
i leave it wholly to the discriminating few who can discover what
belongs to themselves without further comment
 by this time they had arrived at the crown and anchor tavern in
the strand where they found a great number persons assembled sir
f b having been announced as president in a few minutes he was
ushered into the room with all due pomp and ceremony preceded by
the stewards for the occasion and accompanied by a numerous body 
friends consisting mr h major c and others though
not equally prominent equally zealous during dinner time all went on
smoothly except in some instances where the voracity some 
the visitors almost occasioned a chopping off the fingers their
neighbours but the cloth once removed and non nobis domine sung by
professional gentlemen had the effect calling the attention the
company to harmony the band in the orchestra played o give me death
or liberty erin go brach britons strike home and whilst happy
in my native land the singers introduced scots wha hae wi wallace
bled peruvians wake to glory and the tyrolese hymn but the
spirit oratory enlivened by the fire the bottle exhibited its
illuminating sparks in a blaze lustre which eclipsed even the gaslights
by which they were surrounded so much so that the waiters
themselves became confused and remained stationary or when they
moved were so dazzled by the patriotic effusions the various
speakers that they fell over each other spilt the wine in the pockets
 the company and by making afterwards a hasty retreat left them to
fight or argue between each other for supposed liberties taken even by
their immediate friends
illustration pages political dinner
unbridled feelings patriotic ardour appeared to pervade every one
present and what with the splendid oratory the speakers and the
deafening vociferations the hearers at the conclusion what
was generally considered a good point a sufficient indication the
feelings by which they were all animated was evinced
at the lower the table sat a facetious clerical gentleman who
unmindful his ministerial duties was loud in his condemnation 
ministers and as loud in his approbation those who gave them what
he repeatedly called a good hit but here a subject great laughter
occurred for mr marrowfat the peamerchant coventgarden and mr
borrowed the feathermonger drury lane in their zeal for the good
cause arising at the same moment big with ardour and sentiment to
address the chair on a subject the most momentous importance
in their consideration and desirous to signalize themselves
individually so completely defeated their objects by over anxiety to
gain precedence that they rolled over each other on the floor to the
inexpressible amusement the company and the total obliteration 
their intended observations so much so that the harangue meant to
enlighten their friends ended in a fine colloquy abuse upon each
other
the bottles the glasses and the other paraphernalia the table
suffered considerable diminution in the descent these modern cicero
and a variety speakers arising upon their downfall created so much
confusion that our heroes fearing it would be some time before harmony
could be restored took up their hats and walked
now said dashall as they left the house you have had a full
view the pleasantries a political dinner and having seen the
characters by which such an entertainment is generally attended any
further account them is almost rendered useless
at least replied tallyhoho i have been gratified by the view some
 the leading men who contribute to fill up the columns your london
newspapers
egad said his cousin now i think it there is a tine opportunity
 amusing ourselves for the remainder the evening by a peep at
another certain house in westminster whether it may be assimilated in
point character or contents to what we have just witnessed i shall
leave you after taking a review to determine
what do you mean inquired tallyhoho
charley's my boy that's the place for sport something in the old
style the professors there are all the ancient school and we shall
just be in time for the first lecture it is a school science and
though established upon the ancient construction is highly suitable to
the taste the moderns
zounds replied bob our heads are hardly in cue for philosophy after
so much wine and noise we had better defer it to another opportunity
nay nay now's the very time for it it will revive the recollection
 some your former sports
for midst our luxuries be it understood
some traits remain rugged hardihood
 charley is a good caterer for the public appetite and to
diversify the amusements a life in london we will have a little
chaff among the bearwaiters
tallyho stared for a moment then burst into laughter at the curious
introduction his cousin had given to this subject i have long
perceived your talent for embellishment but certainly was not prepared
for the conclusion but you ought rather to have denominated them
students in natural history
and what is that but a branch philosophy inquired dashall
however we are discussing points opinion rather than hastening to
the scene action to become judges facts allons
upon saying this they moved forward with increased celerity towards
tothillfields and soon reached their proposed place destination
on entering tallyhoho was reminded by his cousin to button up his
toggery keep his ogles in action and be awake for said he you
will here have to mingle with some the queer gills and rum copies 
all ranks
this advice being taken they soon found themselves in this temple 
torment where bob surveyed a mostly group assembled and at that moment
engaged in the sports the evening the generality the company bore
the appearance butchers dogfanciers and ruffians intermingled
here and there with a few sprigs fashion a few corinthian shells
costermongers coalheavers watermen soldiers and liveryservants
illustration pages the country squire
the bear was just then pinn'd by a dog belonging to a real lover the
game who with his shirtsleeves tuck'd up declared he was a d d
good one and nothing but a good one so help him g d this dog at
the hazard his life had seized poor bruin by the under lip who
sent forth a tremendous howl indicative his sufferings and was
endeavouring to give him a fraternal hug many other dogs were barking
aloud with anxiety to take an active share in the amusement while the
bear who was chained by the neck to a staple in the wall and compelled
to keep an almost erect posture shook his antagonist with all the fury
 madness produced by excessive torture in the mean time bets were
made and watches pull'd forth to decide how long the bowwow would
bother the ragged russian the dogbreeders were chaffing each other
upon the value their canine property each holding his 
brotherpuppy between his legs till a fair opportunity for a letloose
offered and many wagers were won and lost in a short space time bob
remained a silent spectator while his cousin who was better up to the
gossip mixt with the hardfeatured sportsmen inquired the names 
their dogs what prices were fix'd upon when they had fought last and
other questions equally important to amateurs
bruin got rid his customers in succession as they came up to him
and when they had once made a seizure it was generally by a hug which
almost deprived them life at least it took from them the power 
continuing their hold but his release from one was only the signal for
attack from another
while this exhibition continued tom could not help calling his cousin's
attention to an almost baldheaded man who occupied a front seat and
sat with his dog which was something the bull breed between his
legs while the paws the animal rested on the top rail and which
forcibly brought to his recollection the wellknown anecdote garrick
and the butcher's dog with his master's wig on while the greasy
carcassdealer was wiping the perspiration from his uncovered
pericranium
bob who had seen a badgerbait and occasionally at fairs in the
country a dancing bear had never before seen a bearbait stood up most
 the time observing those around him and paying attention to their
proceedings while entertaining sentiments somewhat similar to the
following lines
what boisterous shouts what blasphemies obscene
what eager movements urge each threatening mien
present the spectacle human kind
devoid feeling destitute mind
with ev'ry dreadful passion rous'd to flame
all sense justice lost and sense shame
when charley the proprietor thought his bear was sufficiently exercised
for the night he was led to his den lacerated and almost lamed to
recover his wounds with an intention that he should fight his
battles o'er again meanwhile tom and bob walk'd homeward
the next day having been appointed for the coronation our most
gracious sovereign our friends were off at an early hour in the
morning to secure their seats in westminster hall and on their
way they met the carriage our disappointed and now much lamented
queen her endeavours to obtain admission to the abbey having proved
fruitless
oh that the monarch had as firmly stood
in all his acts to serve the public good
as in that moment heartfelt joy
that firmness acted only to destroy
a nation's hope to every heart allied
who lived in sorrow and lamented died
it was a painful circumstance to dashall who was seldom severe in his
judgments or harsh in his censures he regretted its occurrence and it
operated in some degree to rob a splendid ceremony its magnificence
and to sever from royalty half its dignity
the preparations however were arranged upon a scale grandeur suited
to the occasion the exterior westminster hall and abbey presented
a most interesting appearance commodious seats were erected for the
accommodation spectators to view the procession in its moving order
and were thronged with thousands anxious subjects to greet their
sovereign with demonstrations loyalty and love
it was certainly a proud day national festivity the firing guns
and the ringing bells announced the progress the coronation in
its various stages to completion and in the evening hyde park was
brilliantly and tastefully illuminated and an extensive range 
excellent fireworks were discharged under the direction sir william
congreve we must however confine ourselves to that which came under the
view the hon tom dashall and his cousin who being seated in
the hall had a fine opportunity witnessing the banquet and the
challenge the champion
a flooring wood had been laid down in the hall at an elevation 
fourteen inches above the flags three tiers galleries were erected
on each side covered with a rich and profuse scarlet drapery falling
from a cornice formed a double row goldtwisted rope and
ornamented with a succession magnificent gold pelmets and rosettes
the front the door which entered from the passage without was
covered with a curtain scarlet trimmed with deep gold fringe and
looped up on each side with silken ropes the floor and to the
extremity the first three steps the throne was covered with a
splendid persianpattern wilton carpet and the remainder the steps
with scarlet baize
the canopy the throne which was square was surrounded by a
beautiful carved and gilt cornice prepared by mr evans beneath the
cornice hung a succession crimsonvelvet helmet drapery each helmet
having embroidered upon it a rose a thistle a crown or a harp
surmounting the cornice in front was a gilt crown upon a velvet cushion
over the letters ceo supported on each side by an antique gilt
ornament the entire back the throne as well as the interior the
canopy were covered with crimson genoa velvet which was relieved by a
treble row broad and narrow gold lace which surrounded the whole
in the centre the back were the royal arms the lion and the unicorn
rampant embroidered in the most costly style under this stood the
chair state and near the throne were six splendid chairs placed for
the other members the royal family these decorations and the hall
being splendidly illuminated presented to the eye a spectacle 
the most imposing nature heightened by the brilliant assemblage 
elegantly dressed personages the ladies universally wore ostrich
feathers and the gentlemen were attired in the most sumptuous dresses
illustration pages grand coronation dinner
about four o'clock his majesty having gone through the other fatiguing
ceremonies the day entered the hall with the crown upon his head
and was greeted with shouts long live the king from all quarters
shortly after which the banquet was served by the necessary officers
but that part the ceremony which most attracted the attention 
tallyhoho was the challenge the champion whose entrance was announced
by the sound the trumpets thrice and who having proceeded on a
beautiful horse in a full suit armour under the porch a triumphal
arch attended by the duke wellington on his right and the deputy
earl marshal on his left to the place assigned him the challenge was
read aloud by the herald he then threw down his gauntlet which having
lain a short time was returned to him this ceremony was repeated three
times when he drank to his majesty and received the gold cup and cover
as his fee
 the whole this magnificent national pageant was conducted
throughout with the most scrupulous attention to the customary etiquette
 such occasions and tallyhoho who had never witnessed any thing the
kind before and consequently could have no conception its splendour
was at various parts the ceremony enraptured he fancied himself
in fairyland and that every thing he saw and heard was the effect 
enchantment our friends returned home highly gratified with their day's
amusement
chapter xxv
behold the ring how strange the group appears
 dirty blackguards commoners and peers
jews who regard not moses nor his laws
all ranks christians eager in the cause
what eager bets what oaths at every breath
who first shall shrink or first be beat to death
thick fall the blows and oft the boxers fall
while deaf'ning shouts for fresh exertions call
till bruised and blinded batter'd sore and maim'd
one gives up vanquish'd and the other lam'd
say men wealth say what applause is due
for scenes like these when patronised by you
these are your scholars who in humbler way
but with less malice at destruction play
you like game cocks strike death with polish'd steel
they dunghighbred use only nature's heel
they fight for something you for nothing fight
they box for love but you destroy in spite
 the following tuesday having been appointed by the knowing ones
for a pugilistic encounter between jack randall commonly called the
nonpareil and martin as well known by the appellation the master 
the rolls from his profession being that a baker an excellent day's
sport was anticipated and the lads the fancy were all upon the quivive

our friends had consequently arranged on the previous night to
breakfast at an early hour and take a gentle ride along the road with
a determination to see as much as possible the attractive amusements
 a millingmatch and to take a view as they went along the company
they were afterwards to mingle with
we shall now said dashall as they sat down to breakfast have a
peep at the lads the ring and see a little the real science 
boxing
we have been boxing the compass through the difficult straits a
london life for some time replied bob and i begin to think that
with all its variety its gaiety and
 its pride the most legitimate joys life may fairly be said to
exist in the country
i confess said dashall that most the pleasures life are
comparative and arise from contrast thus the bustle london
heightens the serenity the country while again the monotony the
country gives additional zest to the evervarying scenes london but
why this observation at a moment when we are in pursuit fresh game
nay said tallyhoho i know not why but i spoke as i thought feeling
as i do a desire to have a pop at the partridges as the season is now
fast approaching and having serious thoughts shifting my quarters
we will talk that hereafter was the reply you have an excellent
day's sport in view let us not throw a cloud upon the prospect before
us you seem rather in the doldrums the amusements this day will
perhaps inspire more lively ideas and then we shall be present at the
masquerade which will doubtless be well attended all the fashion 
the metropolis will be present and there you will find a new world
such as surpasses the powers imagination a sort elysium
unexplored before full mirth frolic whim wit and variety to
charm every sense in nature but come we must not delay participating
in immediate gratifications by the anticipations those intended for
the future besides i have engaged to give the champion a cast to the
scene action in my barouche
by this time piccadilly was all in motion coaches carts gigs
til buries whiskies buggies dogcarts sociables tenets curricles
and sulkies were passing in rapid succession intermingled with
taxcarts and waggons decorated with laurel conveying company the
most varied description in a few minutes the barouche being at
the door crack went the whip and off they bowled bob's eyes were
attracted on all sides here was to be seen the dashing corinthian
tickling up his tits and his bangup setout blood and bone giving
the goby to a heavy drag laden with eight brawny bullfaced blades
smoking their way down behind a skeleton a horse to whom in all
probability a good feed corn would have been a luxury pattering
among themselves occasionally chaffing the more elevated drivers by
whom they were surrounded and pushing forward their nags with all the
ardour a british merchant intent upon disposing a valuable
cargo foreign goods on change there was a waggon full all
sorts upon the lark succeeded by a donkeycart with four insides but
neddy not liking his burthen stopt short on the way a dandy whose
horse's head coming plump up to the back the crazy vehicle at the
moment its stoppage threw the rider into the arms a dustman who
hugging his customer with the determined grasp a bear swore d n
his eyes he had saved his life and he expected he would stand something
handsome for the gemmen all round for if he had not pitched into their
cart he would certainly have broke his neck which being complied with
though reluctantly he regained his saddle and proceeded a little more
cautiously along the remainder the road while groups pedestrians
 all ranks and appearances lined each side
at hydepark corner tom having appointed to take up the prime
hammerman drew up and was instantly greeted by a welcome from the
expected party who being as quickly seated they proceeded on their
journey
this match appears to occupy general attention said tom
i should think so was the reply why it will be a prime thing
as ever was seen betting is all alive the daffy club in tiptop
spirits lots money sported on both sides somebody must make a
mull but randall's the man he is the favourite the day all the
world to a pennyroll
the simile the penny roll being quite in point with the known title
 one the combatants caused a smile on dashall's countenance which
was caught by the eye tallyhoho and created some mirth as it was
a proof what has frequently been witnessed that the lovers the
fancy are as apt in their imaginations at times as they are ready for
the accommodating one two or the friendly flush hit which floors their
opponents
the morning was fine and the numerous persons who appeared travelling
on the road called forth many inquiries from bob
now said he i think i recollect that the admirable author the
sentimental journey used to read as he went along is it possible to
read as we journey forward doubtless replied tom it is and will
produce
 mull defeat loss or disappointment
 a fund amusing speculation as we jog on latter founded his
judgment men upon the formation their features gall and spurzheim
by the lumps bumps and cavities their pericranium but i doubt not
we shall be right in our views the society we are likely to meet
without the help either do you see that group
bob nodded assent
these continued tom are profitable characters or rather men 
profit who kindly considering the constitution their friends
provide themselves with refreshments various kinds to supply the
hungry visitors round the ring oranges nuts apples gingerbread
biscuits and peppermint drops
not forgetting blue ruin and french lace said the man fist
but you have only half done it don't you see the cashcove 
behind with his stick across his shoulder padding the hoof in
breathless speed he has shelled out the lour for the occasion and
is travelling down to keep a wakeful winker on his retailers and
to take care that however they may chuse to lush away the profit they
shall at least take care the principal the little dandy just before
him also acts as whipperin between them they mark out the ground
watch the progress and pocket the proceeds they lend the money for the
others to traffic
i confess said tom i was not exactly up to this
aye aye but i know the bluntmonger and am up to his ways and
means was the reply hallo my eyes here he comes continued he
rising from his seat and bowing obsequiously to a gentleman who passed
them in a tandem all right i am glad it always good sport when
he is present no want sauce or seasoning he always comes it
strong 
i perceive replied tom you allude to the noble marquis w 
 french lace a flash or cant term for brandy
 cashcove a monied man
 padding the hoof travelling on shanks's mare or taking
a turn by the marrowbone stage ie walking
 shelled out the lour supplied the cash
 wakeful winker a sharp eye
 mark out the ground is to place his retailers in various
parts the ring for the accommodation the company anywhere
he may expect to find them himself
 bluntmonger moneydealer or moneylender
 comes it strong no flincher a real good one
 travelling gently along the road they were presently impeded by
a crowd persons who surrounded a long cart or waggon which had just
been overturned and had shot out a motley group personages who
were being lifted on their legs growling and howling at this unforeseen
disaster a hardfeatured sailor whose leg had been broken by the fall
brandished a splinter the fractured limb and swore that although
his timbers were shivered and he had lost a leg in the service he
would not be the last in the ring but he'd be d d if he mount the
rubbishcart any more it is needless to observe his leg was a wooden
one
upon examining the inscription on the cart it was found to contain the
following words household furniture building materials and lumber
carefully removed as it was ascertained that no real injury had
been sustained our party speedily passed the overturned vehicle and
proceeded
the next object attraction was a small cart drawn by one poor animal
sweating and snorting under the weight six swells led by an old man
who seemed almost as incapable as his horse seemed unwilling to perform
the journey a label on the outside the cart intimated that its
contents was soap which created some laughter between tom and bob the
man in the front whose jewlooking appearance attracted attention was
endeavouring to increase the speed the conveyance by belabouring the
boney rump the pray with his hat while some their pedestrian
palls were following close in the rear and taking occasionally
a drap the cratur which was handed out behind and returned after
refreshment
these said tom to his cousin are also men profit but
not exactly in the way those we passed secondrate swells and
brokendown gamesters determined as the saying is to have a shy
even if they lose their sticks and more properly may be termed men 
plunder desperate in their pursuits they turn out with intent to
make the best the day and will not fail to nibble all they can come
easily at
they are not worth the blood from a broken nose said the pugilist
with a feeling for the honour his profession which did him
credit they are all prigs their company
 pray a cant term for a horse
 palls partners accomplices colleagues
 spoils all genteel society and frequently brings disgrace
upon others with whom they are unworthy to associate or even to be
seen there's no getting rid such gentry is it not d d hard a
man can't have a pleasant bit a turnup without having his friends
filched but here comes the gay fellows here they come upon the trot
all eager and anxious to mark the first blow start the odds and curry
the coal these are the lads life true lovers the sport up to
the manoeuvre clear and quicksighted nothing but good ones aye aye
and here comes bill gibbons furnished with the fashionables
what do you call the fashionables inquired bob
why the binders
here he was as much at a loss as ever which the other perceiving he
continued the binders are the stakes and ropes to fence in the ring
bill gibbons who was well known on the road and was speeding down
pretty sharp was followed by crowds vehicles all descriptions as
many to whom the place meeting was but conjectured upon seeing
him felt assured being in the right track here were to be seen the
swells in their tandems the nib sprigs in their gigs buggies and
dogcarts and the tidy ones on their trotters all alive and leaping
mirth and merriment appeared spread over every countenance though
expectation and anxiety were intermingled here and there in the features
 the real lads the fancy many whom upon this very interesting
occasion had bets to a considerable amount depending upon the result 
the day the bangup blades were pushing their prads along in gay style
accompanied by two friends that is to say a biped and a quadruped the
queer fancy lads who had hired hacks from the liverystable keepers
were kicking up a dust and here and there rolling from their prancers
in their native soil while the neck or nothing boys with no prospect
but a whereas before their eyes were as heedless their personal
safety as they were their creditor's property jaded hacks and crazy
vehicles were to be seen on all sides here lay a bankruptcart with
the panels knocked and its driver with an eye knock'd out the horse
lamed and the concern completely knock'd up just before the period
when the hammer the auctioneer was to be called in and his effects
knock'd down there was another
 curry the coal make sure the money
 the same description with a harumscarum devil 
a halfbred making his way at all risks at a full gallop as
unmanageable in his career as his driver had been in his speculations
dust flying women sprawling men bawling dogs barking and the
multitude continually increasing scouts scamps lords loungers and
lacqueys costermongers from to the hill fields and the bloods from
bermondsey completely lined the road as far as the eye could reach
both before and behind it was a day the utmost importance to the
pugilistic school as the contest had excited a most unparalleled degree
 interest
it would be scarcely possible to give a full and accurate description
 the appearances as they went along imagination would labour in vain
and words are altogether incapable conveying a picture the road to
this memorable fight the various instances in which they could discover
that things were not all right were admirably contrasted by others
where care and good coachmanship with a perfect management the
bloods proved the reverse while the single horsemen whose hearts were
really engaged in the sport were picking their way with celerity and
posting to the point attraction the publichouses were thronged
to excess and the turnpikekeepers made a market the mirthmoving
throng
illustration pages road to a fight
our party arrived in the neighbourhood copthorne about halfpast
twelve where all was bustle and confusion the commissary in chief mr
jackson being out town some the subalterns who had taken the
command pro tempore had for divers weighty reasonsprincipally
founded on a view to the profits certain the surrey trusts and to
accommodate the sporting circles at brighton fixed the combat to take
place in a meadow belonging to a farmer named jarvis near this place
on this spot accordingly the ring was formed and an immense mass 
all descriptions vehicles was admitted not much it may naturally
be supposed to the prejudice the owner the premises whose
agents were praiseworthily active in levying proper contributions some
gentlemen however in the neighbourhood observing that the strictest
delicacy was not maintained towards the sacredness their fences
insisted that the place was too confined and intimated that a move must
be made or they should make application to the magistrates and at
the same time suggested crawley downs the site so many former
skirmishes as the most convenient spot for their accommodation
in this state things a move immediately took place and a fresh
ring was established on the spot alluded to but in effecting this new
lodgment much mortification was experienced not alone by those who
after a dreadful drag up one the worst byroads in england had
obtained a comfortable situation but by those who speculating on the
formation the ring had expended considerable sums in the hire 
waggons for their purpose from the surrounding farmers the waggons
it was found impossible to move in due time and thus the new area was
composed such vehicles as were first to reach the appointed ground
the general confusion now was inconceivable for notwithstanding the
departure connoisseurs from jarvis's farm martin still maintained
his post alleging that he was on the ground originally fixed and
that he should expect randall to meet him there in which demand he was
supported by his backers this tended to increase the embarrassment 
the amateurs however about one randall arrived at crawley downs ina
postchaise and took up his quarters at a cottage near the ground
waiting for his man and at two general barton who had just mounted
his charger intending to consult the headquarters the magistrates
to ascertain their intention in case proceeding to action at jarvis's
farm was suddenly arrested in his progress by an express from the
maronites announcing that their champion had yielded his claim to the
choice ground and was so anxious for the mill that he would meet
randall even in a sawpit bill gibbons arriving soon after the ring
with the assistance many hands was quickly formed by which time
tom and bob had secured themselves excellent situations to view the
combat
about twenty minutes before three randall entered the outer ring
attended by general barton and mr griffiths he was attired in a
whitehall upper benjamin and threw his hat into the ring amidst loud
applause in a few minutes after martin approached from an opposite
direction accompanied by mr sant and mr elliott he was also warmly
greeted
the men now passed the ropes and were assisted by their immediate
friends in peeling for action martin was attended by spring and
thereon randall by harry holt and haddington jones
the men stript well and both appeared to be in excellent health good
spirits and high condition but the symmetry randall's bust excited
general admiration and the muscular strength his arms neck and
shoulders bore testimony to his herculean qualities the whole force 
his body in fact seem'd to be concentrated above his waistband martin
stood considerably above him his arms were much longer but they wanted
that bold and imposing weight which characterized those randall they
walked up to the scratch and shook hands in perfect good fellowship
every man now took his station and the heroes threw themselves into
their guard
it was rumoured that martin intended to lose no time in manoeuvring but
to go to work instanter this however he found was not so easily to
be effected as suggested for randall had no favour to grant and was
therefore perfectly on his guard he was all wary caution and had
clearly no intention throwing away a chance but was evidently
waiting for martin to commence martin once or twice made play but
randall was not skittish inclined all was war hawk randall made a
lefthanded hit to draw his adversary but found it would not do
martin then hit right and left but was stopped randall was feeling for
martin's wind but hit above his mark though not without leaving one 
a red colour which told a flattering tale randall returned with his
left and the men got to a smart rally when randall got a konker which
tapped the claret an almost instantaneous close followed in which
randall grasping martin round the neck with his right arm and bringing
his head to a convenient posture served out punishment with his left
this was indeed a terrific position randall was always famous for the
dreadful force his short lefthanded hits and on this occasion they
lost none their former character martin's nob was completely in a
vice and while in that hopeless condition randall fibbed away with the
solid weight the hammer a tuckmill his aim was principally at
the neck where every blow told with horrible violence eight or ten
times did he repeat the dose and then with a violent swing threw
martin to the ground falling on him as he went with all his weight
the ring resounded with applause and jack coolly took his seaton
the knee his second martin's friends began to look blue but
still expected the fight being young there was yet much to be done
all eyes were now turned to martin who being lifted on spring's knee
in a second discovered that he was done his head fell back lifeless
and all the efforts spring to keep it straight were in vain water
was thrown on him in abundance but without effect he was in fact
completely senseless and the halfminute having transpired the
nonpareil was hailed the victor
randall appeared almost without a scratch while poor martin lay like a
lump unleavened dough he was removed and bled but it was some time
before he was conscious his defeat
nothing could exceed the astonishment which so sudden and complete a
finish to the business produced the round lasted but seven minutes and
a half which four minutes and a half had elapsed before a blow was
attempted thus ended one the most extraordinary battles between two
known game men on the pugilistic records very heavy bets had been made
upon it in all parts the kingdom one gentleman is said to have had
five thousand pounds and another one thousand eight hundred guineas
the gains the conqueror were supposed to be about a thousand pounds
the amusements the day were concluded by a second fight between
parish and lashbroke which proved a manly and determined contest for
upwards an hour and in which the combatants evinced considerable
skill and bravery and was finally decided in favour parish all
amusement which might have been derived from this spectacle however
was completely destroyed by the daring outrages an immense gang 
pickpockets who broke in the ring and closed completely up to the
ropes carrying with them every person decent appearance and openly
robbing them their watches pocketbooks and purses and the lateness
 the hour it being five o'clock and almost dark favoured the
depredators
in the midst this struggle tom dashall had nearly lost his fancy
topper and tallyhoho was secretly eased his clicker from the
scene tumult and confusion they were glad to escape and being again
safely seated in the
 topper a flash term given to a hat
 flicker a flash term given to a watch
 barouche they made the best their way home in doing which
they found the roads almost as much clogg'd as they were in the morning
the randallites were meritorious and flushed with good fortune lined
the publichouses on the road to wet their whistles singing and
shouting his name in strains to them equally inspiring as
see the conquering hero comes
sound your trumpets beat your drums
while the maronites rolled along the road in sullen silence and by
the time they reached town an account the battle was hawking about
the streets and songs singing to the praise the successful combatant
in all the melodious cadences a last dying speech and confession
such is the promptitude london printers poets and newsvenders
well said dashall as they reentered the house the events this
day have completely disappointed some the knowing ones
that may be replied bob but they have been too knowing for me
notwithstanding your previous instructions however i don't regret
seeing the humours a prize ring and the next time you catch me
there i must take a lesson from the man profit and keep a wakeful
winker on the possibles really i could not help feeling astonished at
the immense number persons assembled on such an occasion
illustration page a private turnup
zounds said tom tis the real centre attraction the thing
the tippy and the twig among the lads the fancy why it is pretty
generally known through the medium the newspapers that a certain
nobleman paid the debts one these pugilists amounting to l
that he might be released from newgate in order to fight a prize battle
and it is not long since that the marquis t ed e whilst
entertaining a large party after dinner introduced the subject with so
much effect that a purse guineas was subscribed among them for a
turn up between two the prime hammered who being introduced
actually setto in his drawingroom for the amusement his friends
nor is it less true that this sporting nobleman gloriously took up the
conqueror as the saying is and evinced his patronage and his power at
once by actually subduing his antagonist proving to certitude that if
his lordship would but practise this sublime art he could hardly
fail adding to his present title that the champion england it
is the theme constant conversation and in many cases there is more
anxiety about contests this sort than there is about the arrival a
monarch on the irish coast among the lads parties whiskey and
buttermilk thoughts are busy energies are active and money in galore
is circulated upon it
bob laughed heartily at these observations his cousin upon what he
termed the sublime art
you don't appear to enter into the spirit it continued tom but
i can assure you it is a very animating subject and has occupied the
attention all classes from the peer to the prelate the peasant
and the potboy it is said that one the lower order ranting
preachers not many miles from boltononthemoors lately addressed
his auditory in the following metaphorical language accompanied with
striking and appropriate attitudes i dare say now you'd pay to see
a boxingmatch between randall and turner or martin yet you don't like
to pay for seeing a pitchedbattle between me and the black champion
beelzebub oh my friends many a hard knock and many a crossbuttock
have i given the arch bruiser mankind aye and all for your dear
sakes pull do pull off those gay garments mammon strike the devil
a straightforward blow in the mouth darken his spiritual daylight
at him manfully give it him right and left and i'll be your
bottleholder i ask nothing but the money which you'll not forget
before you go 
the true spirit moved him said bob and a very laudable one too but
he very emphatically deprecated the votaries mammon
certainly he being called would have been unworthy his calling if
he had not
this conversation was carried on over a glass generous wine and
dwindling into indifferent subjects is not necessary to be detailed
suffice it to say that fatigued with the day's exertions they sought
repose in the arms morpheus at an early hour determined on the
pursuit fresh game with the dawn the morning
chapter xxvi
see yonder beaux so delicately gay
and yonder belles so'deck'd in thin array
ah rather see not what a decent pride
would teach a maiden modestly to hide
the dress so flimsy the exposure such
twould almost make a very wanton blush
e'en married dames forgetting what is due
to sacred ties give half clad charms to view
what calls them forth to brave the daring glance
the public ball the midnight wanton dance
there many a blooming nymph by fashion led
has felt her health her peace her honour fled
truss'd her fine form to strange fantastic shapes
to be admir'd and twirl'd about by apes
or mingling in the motley masquerade
found innocence by visor vice betrayed
an agreeable lounge through the parks in the morning afforded them an
opportunity recalling in idea the pleasures the past real life in
london which tallyhoho had been enabled to partake and during which
he again signified a desire to change the scene by a departure at
an early period for his native vales to breathe as he observed the
uncontaminated air the country to watch the wary pointer and mark
the rising covey to pursue the timid hare or chase the cunning
fox and dashall finding him inflexible notwithstanding his glowing
descriptions scenes yet unexplored at length consented to accompany
him to belville hall upon condition that they should return again ina
month this mode arrangement seemed perfectly satisfactory to bob
and a view the panorama and a peep at the tennis court would have
finished their rambles for the day but at the latter place 
amusement and healthful exercise meeting with young mortimer a further
development facts relative to sparkle and his bride transpired in
which it appeared that they had arrived at their place destination
and had forwarded an invitation to his brotherinlaw to pay them
an early visit and who proposed starting in a few days
well said dashall we will all go together and no doubt with our
old friend sparkle we shall be able to endure the unchanging prospects
 a country life
in the country how blest when it rains in the fields
to feast upon transports that shuttlecock yields
or go crawling from window to window to see
an ass on a common a crow on a tree
in the country you're nail'd like some pale in your park
to some stick a neighbour crammed into the ark
and if you are sick or in fits tumble down
you reach death ere the doctor can reach you from town
never mind cried tallyhoho a change scene will no doubt be useful
and at all events by enduring the one we may learn more judiciously
to appreciate the other
true said tom and i shall like myself all the better for being
in good company but pray mr mortimer what do you mean to do at the
approaching masquerade
not quite decided yet was the reply
you go course
certainly as orpheus or apollo but pray what character do you intend
to sustain
that's a secret 
worth knowing i suppose well well i shall find you out never
fear
time's a telltale said dashall and will most likely unfold all
mysteries but i always think the life and spirit a masquerade is
much injured by a knowledge the characters assumed by friends unless
it be where two or more have an intention playing as it were
to and with each other for where there is mystery there is always
interest i shall therefore propose that we keep to ourselves the
characters in which we mean to appear for i am determined if possible
to have a merry night it
on the lightly sportive wing
at pleasure's call we fly
hark they dance they play they sing
in merry merry revelry
hark the tabors lively beat
and the flute in numbers sweet
fill the night with delight
at the masquerade
let the grave ones warn us as they may
 every harmless joy afraid
whilst we're young and gay
we'll frolic and play
at the masquerade
 tom's observations upon this subject were in perfect accordance
with those mortimer and tallyhoho though he had intended to consult
his cousin as to the character he should appear in he now determined
to take his own direction or to have advice from centum in the strand
whose advertisements to supply dresses c he had observed in the
newspapers
these preliminaries being decided upon as far as appeared needful at
the moment mortimer departed towards home where he expected to meet
his uncle upon his return from the chase after the fugitives sparkle
and miss mortimer now mrs sparkle and tom and bob to piccadilly
where a select party dashall's friends were invited to dinner and
where they enjoyed a pleasant evening drank rather freely and had but
little to regret after it except certain qualmish feelings the head
and stomach the next morning
the anticipated masquerade had been the principal subject 
conversation so long as reason held her sway but the hard exercise 
the arm and the generosity the wine had an early and visible effect
upon some the party who did not separate till a late hour leaving
bob just strength and intelligence enough to find the way to his
dormitory
by the arrival the appointed evening for the grand masquerade at
vauxhall gardens tom dashall who had a particular view in keeping
his intended proceedings a secret had arranged all to his wishes and
anticipated considerable amusement from the interest he should take
in the safety his cousin whom he entertained no doubt quickly
discovering and with whom he determined to promote as much mirth as
possible
tallyhoho in the mean time had also made occasional calls upon merrywell
in his confinement and under his direction been preparing for the
occasion equally determined if ch was
the barber and which the sweep they were now suddenly attracted by a
grotesque dance between a clown the grimaldi school and a fancy old
woman in a garment patchwork made in an ancient fashion a red nose
long rows beads for earrings and a pair spectacles surmounted by
a high calledcap decorated with ribbons various hues rendered
her the most conspicuous character in the room and notwithstanding
her highheeled shoes she proved herself an excellent partner for the
clown
by this time bob who was anxious to carry his plan into execution
began to be fidgety and proposed a walk into the open air again as
they left the room his ears were attracted by the following song by a
watchman which he could not help stopping to catch and which afforded
his cousin an excellent opportunity giving him the slip
fly ye prigs for now's the hour
tho boosey kids have lost their power
when watchful charleys like the sun
their nightly course duty run
beneath the palefaced moon
 prigs pickpockets
 boosey kids drunken men
 charleys a cant term for watchmen
but take this warning while ye fly
that if you nibble click or clye
my sight's so dim i cannot see
unless while you the bluntly tip me
then stay then stay
for i shall make this music speak
and bring you up before the beak
unless the chink's in tune
now ye rambling sons night
or peepoday boys on your flight
well prim'd with jack or child tom's juice
while you the silver key produce
your safety then is clear
but snuffy and not up to snuff
you'll and your case is queer enough
shell out the nonsense half a quid
will speak more truth than all your whid
then go then go
for if you linger on your way
you'll for my music dearly pay
i'll quod you never fear
turning round with laughter from this character who had attracted many
hearers he look'd in vain for dashall and was not displeased to find
he had fled he therefore hastily withdrew from the scene merriment
and according to the instructions previously received and for which
he had prepared quickly changed his dress and appeared again in the
character a judge under the impression hinted by his counsellor
that the gravity his wig and gown with a steady countenance
 click a contraction the word clinker for a watch
 lye a pockethandkerchief
 blunt money
 music alluding to the rattle
 beak a magistrate
 peepoday boys staunch good ones reeling home after
the frolics the night
 silver key money which is thus termed as it is supposed
to open all places and all hearts
if you are sick and like to die
and for the doctor send
or have the cholic in your eye
still money is your friend is it not
 snuffy drunk
 up to snuffelevation ideas
 shell out the nonsense to pay money
 half a quid half a guinea
 whit words or talk
 would be a quiet and peaceable part to get through and shield
him from the torment those whom bob suspected willing to play tricks
with him should he be discovered here however he again found himself
at fait for he had scarcely entered the gardens before a host 
depredators were brought before him for trial the charleys brought in
succession drunken fiddlers tinkers and barbers and appeals were
made to his patience in so many voices and under so many varying
circumstances that justice was nearly running mad and poor tallyhoho
could find no chance making a reply an uproar from the approaching
crowd announced some more than ordinary culprit and in a moment who
should appear before him but a don giovanni and the hooking devil here
was a fine case for decision the devil claimed the don as his property
and addressed the representative justice as follows
most learned and puissant judge
protect my rights as you would the rights man i claim my property
and will have my claim allowed
hold replied bob if that is the case you have no occasion to
appeal to me begone black wretch and in thy native shades yell forth
thy discordant screams
most righteous judge a second daniel cried a bearded shylock with
his knife and scales he shan't escape me i'll have my bond so bare
his bosom next the heart let me come near him
this is playing the devil indeed said the don
by the powers cried a looney mackwolteb he's jump'd out the
fire into the fryingpan and when the slouched has done wit him he
may be drilled in his own fat
at this moment a leporello who caught the last words the irishman
burst into the presence the judge singing
zounds sir they'll grill you now lean or fat i know what games you
were always at and told you before what harm you would hatch now the
old gentleman's found you out he'll clap us all in the roundabout let
us be off ere they call for the watch
the word watch was reechoed in a thousand voices the vociferations 
the callers the noise the rattles and the laughter 
those immediately surrounding the judgmentseat offered so good an
opportunity for escape that giovanni determining to have another
chance burst from the grasp the arch enemy mankind to pursue
his wonted vagaries to the no small gratification bob who without
actually acquitting the prisoner rejoiced at his own escape
he had however scarcely time to congratulate himself before he was
annoyed by a postman in the usual costume whom he had already seen
delivering letters to the company the contents which appeared to
afford considerable amusement and who presenting a letter addressed
to the lord chief justice bunglecause in a moment disappeared breaking
open the envelope he read with astonishment the following lines
tho justice prevails
under big wigs and tails
you've not much law in your nob
so this warning pray take
your big wig forsake
and try a more modern scratch bob
go along bob lord chief justice bob in a scratch cried a waterman
at his elbow who had heard him reading in a voice loud enough to be
heard at some distance
there he'll be at home to a hair squeaked a little finicking
personification a modern peruquier sidling up to him picking his
teeth with a tortoiseshell comb
bob in bursting hastily away under the reiterated cries go along
bob lord chief justice bob with the idea overtaking the postman
found himself in a moment lock'd in the close embraces a meg
terrifies while a little bandylegg'd representative the late sir
jeffrey dunstan bawling out ould wigs ould wigs made a snatch at the
grave appendage justice and completely dismantled the head its
august representative this delayed him in his progress but it was
merely to witness the wig flying in the air with as much mirth to the
surrounding company as when the greasy nightcap the rev george
harvest was toss'd about the pit at the theatre each one giving it a
swing who could get within reach it thus mutilated in his 
apparel and probably conceiving according to the song
the wig's the thing the wig the wig
the wisdom's in the wig
bob tallyhoho took flight into a dressingroom declaring justice was
abroad and propriety not at home he was however rather at a loss as
in his last character he had not been able to meet with the turk but
determined to resume the search in a domino having therefore equipped
himself as a spectator he again sallied forth with intention to explore
the room and for a time remained comparatively unmolested but as he
could no where find his cousin he strolled indiscriminately among the
characters viewing whatever appeared amusing or interesting in his
way the fineness the weather greatly animated the scene and
gave increased brilliancy and effect to the illuminations which
were disposed in a numerous variety splendid devices representing
national trophies stars wreaths and crowns laurel it was the
first moment he had found an opportunity viewing the place in which
he had been acting
the amusements the evening were judiciously varied and protracted
by a constant succession entertainments various descriptions mr
chains exhibited many his most surprising deceptions in the rotunda
where also young gyngell displayed some capital performances on the
slackwire in the long room the celebrated fantoccini exhibition with
groupes quadrille dancers enlivened the scene in one walk the
garden mr gyngell's theatre arts was erected where were exhibited
balancing the ombres chinoises gymnastic exercises and other
feats and mr gyngell performed several airs on the musical glasses in
another punchinello delighted the beholders with his antics in a
third a very expert juggler played a variety clever tricks and
sleightoffhand deceptions and a couple itinerant italians exhibited
their musical and mechanical showboxes in another part the gardens
the celebrated diavolo antonio went through his truly astonishing
evolutions on the corde volante the duke gloucester's fine
military band occupied the grand orchestra an excellent quadrille band
played throughout the night in the long room while a scottish reel
band in the rotunda and a pandean band in the gardens played
alternately reels waltzes and country dances
this interval peace was truly acceptable to bob and he did not fail
to make the most it roving like the bee from one delight to another
sipping pleasure as he went almost regretting he had not taken the last
dress first though he was every now and then importuned by mendicants
and servant girls very desirous to obtain places all work the
introduction a dancing bear who appeared to possess more christian
qualities than his leader attracted his attention but in pressing to
the scene action he received a floored from a bruiser in gloves who
milled indiscriminately all who came in his way till the bear took the
shine out him by a fraternal embrace and his leader very politely
asked those around which they thought the greater bear the two upon
rising bob found himself in the hands two itinerant quack doctors
each holding an arm and each feeling for his pulse one declared the
case was mortal a dislocation the neck had taken place and there
was no chance preserving life except by amputation the head
the other shook his head look'd grave pull'd out his lancet and
prescribed phlebotomy and warm water
bob who had received no injury except a little contusion occasioned by
the blow seized the ignorant practitioners by the throat and knocking
their heads together exclaimed with a stentorian voice
throw physic to the clogs i'll none on't go along bob was
repeated again as loud and as long as before he however burst from
those around him in pursuit fresh game nor was he disappointed for
he presently found a dapper young clergyman in gown and surplice
and who with in hand was fervently engaged in exhortations and
endeavours to turn from the evil their ways a drunken sailor and
a hardened thief the arson the iron chest when the group were
surrounded by a detachment the imps and devils giovanni in london
a truly horrid and diabolical crew who by their hideous yells frantic
capers violent gestures and the flaring their torches scared the
affrighted parson from his task made his intended penitents their own
and became an almost intolerable nuisance to the rest the
company for the remainder the evening
while he was thus engaged the supperboxes were thrown open and the
company appeared to be all on the move towards the more substantial
entertainments the evening he was next suddenly detained by a jew
pedlar who was anxious to shew him his wares
get out slouched said bob
ant is dat all vat you can say to a poor honest jew what wants to
live by his trade for vye you trow my religions in my teeth i'm so
honest vat i never cheats nobody will you puy a gould l vat you
take for your gown i shall puy or sell it's all the same to me
now whatsoever country by chance i travel through tis all the same to
i so the monies but comes in some people call me ties just because i
am a jew so to make them tell the truth vy i thinks there is no sin so
i shows them all mine coots vic a sober winning grace and i sometimes
picks dere pockets whilst they're smiling in my face
bob laugh'd but declared he'd have nothing to do with him
then said the hon tom dashall you may go along bob
what is it possible i have been looking for you these two hours
i can't eat pork said dashall resuming his character
come along said bob happy to find his relation and catching him
by the arm they proceeded to refreshment and partook an excellent
supper cold viands plentifully supplied and accompanied with a
profusion ices and jellies served up in a style highly creditable to
the managers
here they were joined by mortimer who had been as frolicsome as any imp
in the gardens in the character the devil but who had lost sight
 the dandy officer and the nun whom he had so ingeniously hooked
together the wine was good and after enjoying their repast tom
and mortimer enshrined themselves in dominos for the remainder 
the evening the usual masquerade frolics and dancing were afterwards
continued and about five in the morning they left this region fun
mirth and good humour
chapter xxvii
that life is a picture strange things and ways
a grand exhibition each hour displays
and for london there's no place can with it compare
tis a jumble every thing curious and rare
cheapside bustlers fleet street hostlers
jockeys doctors agents proctors
bow street sanguis bond street sanguis
hide and seekers opera squeers
lawyers tailors bailiffs jailors
shorten butlers alderman gutters
patriot talkers sunday walkers
dancers actors jews contractors
placemen croakers boxers brokers
swindlers coroners spies and foreigners
and all all to keep up the bubble strife
and prove ways and means is the picture life
the bustle and merriment the masquerade were long remembered in the
mind bob tallyhoho and furnished frequent conversations between him
and his cousin and the laughable occurrences the evening in which
they had been engaged were reenjoyed in recollection notwithstanding
the preparations they were making for an excursion another kind
in the country which though not exactly to the taste dashall was
inflexibly persevered in by tallyhoho
tom tried every effort in his power to prolong the appointed period
 departure in again the heart and mind his cousin appeared to
be occupied with anticipated delights which he described in the most
glowing colours imagination the healthful fields the enlivening fox
chase and the sportive exercises a country life were detailed with
ecstacy and though last not least the additional zest for the more
attractive scenes in tom's idea that would present themselves for
inspection upon a return to the metropolis at length it was fi
buildings at a distance where they were scarcely discernible by the
naked eye bob was delighted with the view greenwich hospital and
the account which his cousin gave him the establishment and upon
descending they took a complete walk round this celebrated pillar
marking its decorations and reading the inscription
it is said tom a fluted column the doric order the total height
is feet the diameter at the base feet and the height the
column feet the cone at the top with its urn are feet the
height the massy pedestal is feet there are steps inside
but continued he ait is really a great pity that this beautiful
monument should be in such a confined situation for in a proper
place it would form one the most striking objects the kind that
architecture is capable producing
the inscription it is true continued dashall had better be erased
it contains a libel or more properly a lie which almost contradicts
itself for no rational being can entertain the notion that the
catholics or indeed any religious sect could wilfully have perpetrated
so horrible a deed as this pillar was intended to impute to them nor
can so much credit be given to human foresight as for it to be concluded
that a fire which broke out in a single house could upon this rather
than upon other occasions have extended its ravages in so extraordinary
a manner
 while we arc on the spot we will take a peep at a curious piece
 antiquity not that i am so great a lover such curiosities but it
would appear almost unpardonable for you to have been in london without
seeing london stone
i have heard it said tallyhoho and if we are near let us have a
view
come on then said dashall this same london stone is at present
fixed close under the south wall st swithin's church cannon
street it has by some been supposed british origin a kind solemn
boundary or some other object probably a religious nature which
through every change and convulsion the state has been preserved with
reverential care but this is the very place said he
bob stared about him with surprise to discover this curious and
apparently valuable relic without finding it till at length his
cousin directed his attention to the spot which at present is under a
pitchingblock or restingplace for persons carrying heavy loads and
almost burst into laughter for he had raised his cousin's expectation
by the previous description
how said tallyhoho and is this your curiosity
even so replied tom that is the celebrated london stone it
formerly stood nearer the

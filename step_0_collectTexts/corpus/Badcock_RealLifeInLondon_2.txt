middle the street was placed deep in the
ground and strongly fixed with iron bars according to account the
first mention it was in the reign athelstan king the west
saxons and it has been usually viewed by our antiquaries as a military
stone from which the romans began the computation their miles a
conjecture which certainly appears very reasonable not only from the
discovery the roman road after the year running directly to
this stone from watling street but from the exact coincidence which its
distance bears with the neighbouring station mentioned in antoine's
itinerary the principal whose journeys either begin or with
london
the sound a horn interrupted this conversation
apropos said tom we can take the post office in our way a place 
considerable importance so allons
they now pursued their way to lombard street
this collection buildings said dashall as they entered
important as its concerns are to the nation claims no praise as a
building it stands behind lombard street from which on the
south side the street there is a passage leading to it under an
arched gateway
a plan has however been adopted for erecting a building worthy 
this great establishment on the site now called st martin'slegrand
and to improve the access to it by pulling down the east ends newgate
street and paternosterrow it is now proceeding rapidly
the postoffice system is however one the most perfect regulations
 finance and convenience existing under any government it has
gradually been brought to its present perfection being at first in the
hands individuals and replete with abuses in its present form it
not only supplies the government with a great revenue but accomplishes
that by means highly beneficial to the persons contributing
the postoffice is the most important spot on the surface the globe
it receives information from all countries it distributes instructions
to the antipodes it connects together more numerous and distant
interests men than any similar establishment it is in the highest
degree hitherto realized the seat terrestrial perception and
volition the brain the whole earth and hitherto it has been in a
narrow valley misshapen even to deformity and scarcely accessible to
the few mail coaches which collect there for their nightly freights
the present postoffice was erected in but great additions have
been made to it from time to time though the whole is disjointed and
inconvenient
the mode carrying letters by the general post was greatly improved
a few years since by a most admirable plan invented by mr palmer
previously to its adoption letters were conveyed by carts without
protection from robbery and subject to delays at present they are
carried according to mr palmer's plan by coaches distinguished
by the name mailcoaches provided with a wellarmed guard and
forwarded at the rate eight miles an hour including stoppages
government contracts with coachkeepers merely for carrying the mail
the coachowner making a profitable business besides carrying
passengers and parcels it is not easy to imagine a combination 
different interests to one purpose more complete than this the
wretched situation however the horses on account the length
 the stages which they are frequently driven is a disgrace to the
character the british nation and requires the interference 
the legislature no stage should exceed twelve miles in length
the rapidity this mode conveyance is unequalled in any country
and the present rate charge for each passenger is little more than
sixpence per mile
houses having boxes for receiving letters before five o'clock are
open in every part the metropolis and after that hour bellmen
collect the letters during another hour receiving a fee one penny
for each letter but at the general postoffice in lombard street
letters are received till seven o'clock after which time till half an
hour after seven a fee sixpence must be paid and from half after
seven till a quarter before eight the postage must also be paid as
well as the fee sixpence
well said tallyhoho for a place such public utility and constant
resort i must confess i expected to see a building the most
magnificent kind but i am also puzzled to conceive how such extensive
business can be carried on with so much regularity as it is
your observation replied his cousin exactly coincides with that
 many others but you will some day or other be as much surprised
on other subjects for there are places in london where mercantile and
legal business is conducted in situations obscurity which you can
have no conception but as a national establishment though its internal
regulations are good its external appearance is no recommendation toit
but come let us proceed towards home i have a call or two to make
on the road for as we depart quickly for the open fields and are to
bid adieu to london smoke as well as london stone we have but little
time to spare so let us post away
bob alive to this subject did not require a second hint but taking
the arm dashall they proceeded along cheapside made a call at
mortimer's the gunsmith's on lydgate hill provided themselves withall
necessary shooting apparatus and tom ever mindful the variety
which he conceived would be needful to render rusticity agreeable on
their way purchased a pair boxing gloves a backgammon board and
other amusing articles to provide as he said against a rainy day
on arrival at home they were presented with a letter from sparkle
announcing his arrival at his new mansion and expressing a hope that he
should have the pleasure meeting his friends within a day or
two expatiating with great apparent delight upon the happiness his
own situation and promising lots amusement in detailing to them the
events his peregrinations this operated as an additional spur to the
speed their departure and it was agreed that they should start the
next morning
i don't know said bob whether i should really like a continued
life in london i have seen many its comforts and many its
inconveniences then replied tom you may certainly by the
exercise your reason and the decision your judgment upon mature
reflection strike the balance and if you do not give it in favour 
the former i shall entertain doubts upon your sagacity
well continued bob i shall now have a fine opportunity for drawing
out a distinct account and when done i will submit the result to your
inspection
every thing being prepared they were on the road to belville hall at an
early hour the next morning
as the occurrences a country excursion or the delineation a
country life form no part the intended plan this work we shall
not enter into any detailed account but leaving our heroes in the
pursuit fresh game under new circumstances and in somewhat
new situations bear in our minds their intended return to engage
contemplate and enjoy a future review the complicated yet ever new
and ever varying scenes a real life in london with a determination
to meet them on arrival and not lose sight them in their future

with what unequal tempers are we form'd
one day the soul elate and satisfied
revels secure and fondly tells herself
the hour evil can return no more
the next the spirit pall'd and sick riot
turns all to discord and we hate our being
curse our past joys and think them folly all
matter and motion say philosophers are inseparable and the
doctrine appears equally applicable to the human mind our country
squire anxious to testify a grateful sense the attentions paid
him during his london visit had assiduously exerted himself since his
return in contributing to the pleasures and amusements his visitors
and belville hall presented a scene festive hospitality at once
creditable to its liberal owner and gratifying to the numerous gentry
 the surrounding neighbourhood
but however varied and numerous the sports and recreations rural
life however refined and select the circle its society they
possessed not the endless round metropolitan amusement nor those
evervarying delights produced amid the busy hum men where every
street is replete with incident and character and every hour fraught
with adventure
satiety had now evidently obtruded itself amid the party and its
attendants lassitude and restlessness were not long in bringing up the
rear the impression already made upon the mind bob by the cursory
view he had taken life in london was indelible and it required
little persuasion on the part his cousin the hon tom dashall
to induce him again to return to scenes so much delight and which
afforded such inexhaustible stores amusement to an ardent and
youthful curiosity
a return to the metropolis having therefore been mutually agreed
upon and every previous arrangement being completed the squire once
more abdicated for a season his paternal domains and accompanied by
his cousin dashall and the whole cidevant party belville hall
arrived safe at the elegant mansion the latter where they planned
a new system perambulation having for its object a further
investigation manners characters objects and incidents connected
with real life in london 
come cried dashall one fine morning starting up immediately after
breakfast
rouse for fresh game and away let us haste
the regions to roam wit fashion and taste
like quixote in quest adventures set out
and learn what the crowds in the streets are about
and laugh when we must and approve when we can
where london displays ev'ry feature man
the numerous hotels bagnios taverns inns coffeehouses
eatinghouses lodginghouses c in endless variety which meet
the eye in all parts the metropolis afford an immediate choice
 accommodation as well to the temporary sojourner as the permanent
resident where may be obtained the necessaries and luxuries life
commensurate with your means payment from one shilling to a guinea
for a dinner and from sixpence to thirty shillings a night for a
lodging
the stranger recommended to one these hotels who regales himself
after the fatigues a journey with moderate refreshment and retires
to rest and preparing to depart in the morning is frequently surprised
at the longitudinal appearance and sum total his bill wherein every
item is individually stated and at a rate enormously extravagant
remonstrance is unavailable the charges are those common to the house
and in failure payment your luggage is under detention without
the means redress ultimately the bill must be paid and the only
consolation left is that you have acquired a useful though
expensive lesson how to guard in future against similar exaction and
inconvenience
 marlborough street yesterday mrs hickinbottom the
wife mr hickinbottom the keeper the st petersburg
hotel in dover street piccadilly appeared to a summons to
answer the complaint a gentleman for unlawfully detaining
his luggage under the following circumstances the
complainant stated that on thursday evening last on his
arrival in town from aberdeen he went to the white horse
cellar piccadilly but the house being full he was
recommended to the st petersburg hotel in dover street
where having taken some refreshment and wrote a letter he
went to bed and on the following morning after breakfast
he desired the waiter to bring him his bill which he did
and the first item that presented itself was the moderate
charge one pound ten shillings for his bed and then
followed amongst many others sixpence for a pen a
shilling for wax a shilling for the light and two and
sixpence for other lights so that the bill amounted in the
whole to the sum two pounds one shilling for his night's
lodging to this very exorbitant charge he had refused to
submit in consequence which he had been put to great
inconvenience by the detention his luggage the
magistrate animadverted with much severity on such
extravagant charges on the part the tavernkeeper and
advised that upon the gentleman paying fifteen shillings
the things might be immediately delivered up to these
terms however mrs hickinbottom refused to accede adding
at the same time that the gentleman had only been charged
the regular prices the house and that she should insist
upon the whole amount the bill being paid for that the
persons who were in the habit coming to their house never
objected to such the regular price their lodgings being
ten guineas per week the magistrate lamented that he had
no power to enforce the things being given up but he
recommended the complainant to bring an action against the
tavernkeeper for the detention
 these were the observations directed by dashall to his friend
as they passed one morning the hotel de la sabloniere in leicester
square
doubtless he continued in those places affluent resort the
accommodations are in the first style excellence yet with reference
to comfort and sociability were i a country gentleman in the habit 
occasionally visiting london my temporary domicile should be the snug
domesticated coffeehouse economical in its charges and pleasurable in
the variety its visitors where i might at will extend or abridge
my evening intercourse and in the retirement my own apartment feel
myself more at home than in the vacuum an hotel
the attention our perambulators in passing through the square was
attracted by a fine boy apparently about eight years age dressed in
mourning who at the door brunet's hotel was endeavouring withall
his little strength and influence to oppose the egress a large
newfoundland dog that indignant restraint seemed desirous in a
strange land introducing himself to canine good fellowship the
boy whose large dark eyes were full animation and his countenance
though bronzed interestingly expressive remonstrated with the dog in
the french language the animal does not understand you exclaimed
tallyhoho in the vernacular idiom the youth speak to him in
english he must be a clever dog answered the boy to know english
so soon for neither him nor i have been in england above a week and
for the first time in our lives and how is it asked tallyhoho
that you speak the english language so fluently o said the little
fellow my mother taught it me she is an english woman and for that
reason i love the english and am much fonder talking their language
than my own there was something extremely captivating in the boy the
dog now struggling for freedom was nearly effecting his release
when the two friends interposed their assistance and secured the
premeditating fugitive at the moment when to inquire the cause the
bustle the father the child made his appearance in the person
 field marshal count bertrand the count possessing all the
characteristics a gentleman acknowledged politely the kind attention
 the strangers to his son while on the other hand they returned
his obeisance with the due respect excited by his uniform friendship and
undeviating attachment to greatness in adversity the discerning eye
 field marshal bertrand justly appreciated the superior rank the
strangers to whom he observed that during the short period he had then
been in england he had experienced much courtesy which he should
always retain a grateful recollection this accidental interview was
creative reciprocal satisfaction and the parties separated not
without an invitation on the part the boy that his newly found
acquaintances would again visit the friends the emperor
 lines supposed to have been written by
the exemperor napoleon in his last illness
too slowly the tide existence recedes
for him in captivity destined to languish
the exile abandon'd fortune who needs
the friendship death to obviate his anguish
yet even his last moments unmet by a sigh
napoleon the great uncomplaining shall die
though doom'd on thy rock st helena to close
my life that once presag'd ineffable glory
unvisited here though my ashes repose
no tablet to tell the lone exile's sad story
napoleon buonaparte still shall the name
exist on the records immortal fame
posterity tracing the annals france
the merits will own her potent defender
her greatness preeminent skill'd to advance
creating sustaining her zenith splendour
who patroniz'd arts and averted alarms
till crush'd by the union nations in arms
i yield to my fate nor should memory bring
one moment fruitless and painful reflection
 what i was lately an emperor and king
unless for the bitter yet fond recollection
 those who my heart's best endearments have won
remote from my deathbed my consort and son
denied in their arms even to breathe my last sigh
no relatives solace my exit attending
with strangers sojourning midst strangers i die
no tear regret with the last duties blending
to him the lorn exile no obsequies paid
whose fiat a universe lately obey'd
make there then my tomb where the willow trees wave
and far in the island the streamlet meanders
if ever by stealth to my green grassy grave
some kind musing spirit sympathy wanders
here rests he will say from adversity's pains
napoleon buonaparte's mortal remains
we have no disposition to enter into the character the
deceased exemperor history will not fail to do justice
alike to the merits and the crimes one who is inevitably
destined to fill so portentous a page on its records at the
present time to speak the good which he may have been
either the intentional or the involuntary instrument
without some bias party feeling would be impossible
hard is his fate on whom the public gaze
is fix'd for ever to condemn or praise
repose denies her requiem to his name
and folly loves the martyrdom fame
at all events he is now no more and an english spirit
wars not with the dead
the count said dashall to his cousin as they pursued their walk
remains in england until he obtain permission from the king 
france to return to his native country that such leave will be given
there is little doubt the meritorious fidelity which the count has
uniformly exemplified to his late unfortunate and exiled master
has obtained for him universal esteem and the king france is too
generous to withhold amidst the general feeling his approbation
passing through long acre in their progress towards the british museum
to which national establishment they had cards admission the two
friends were intercepted in their way by a concourse at a coachmaker's
shop fronting which stood a chariot carefully matted round the
body firmly sewed together and the wheels enveloped in haybands
preparatory to its being sent into the country scarcely had these
precautionary measures safety been completed when a shrill cry
as if by a child inside the vehicle was heard loud and continuation
which after the lapse some minutes broke out into the urgent and
reiterated exclamation let me out i shall be suffocated pray
let me out
the workmen who had packed up the carriage stared at each other in
mute and appalling astonishment they felt conscious that no child was
within the vehicle and when at last they recovered from the stupor 
amazement they resisted the importunity the multitude to strip the
chariot and manfully swore that if any one was inside it must bethe
devil himself or one his imps and no human or visible being
whatsoever
some the multitude were inclined to a similar opinion the
crowd increased and the most intense interest was depicted in every
countenance when the cry let me out i shall die for heaven's
sake let me out was audibly and vehemently again and again repeated
the impatient multitude now began to cut away the matting when the
workmen apprehensive that the carriage might sustain some damage from
the impetuosity their proceedings took upon themselves the act 
dismantling the mysterious machine during which operation the cry 
let me out became more and more clamorously importunate at last
the vehicle was laid bare and its door thrown open when to the utter
amazement the crowd no child was there no trace was to be seen 
aught human or superhuman the assemblage gazed on the vacant
space from whence the sounds had emanated in confusion and dismay
during this momentary suspense in which the country squire
participated a voice from some invisible agent as if descending the
steps the carriage exclaimed thank you my good friends i am very
much obliged to you i shall now go home and where my home is you will
all know byandby
with the exception dashall and tallyhoho the minds the spectators
previously impressed with the legends superstition and diablerie
gave way under the dread the actual presence his satanic majesty
and the congregated auditors his ominous denunciation instantaneously
dispersed themselves from the scene witchery and reassembling in
groupes on distant parts the street cogitated and surmised on the
devil's visit to the coachmakers long acre
tallyhoho now turned an inquisitive eye on his cousin who answered the
silent and anxious enquiry with an immoderate fit laughter declaring
that this was the best and most ingenious hoax any he had ever
witnessed and that he would not have missed on any consideration
whatsoever the pleasure enjoying it the devil in long acre i
shall never forget it exclaimed the animated cousin the staring and
discomfited squire
explain explain reiterated the squire impatiently
you shall have it in one wordanswered dashall ventriloquism
 this hoax was actually practised by a ventriloquist in the
manner described it certainly is a less offensive nature
than that many others which have been successfully
brought forward in the metropolis the offspring folly
and idleness a fellow some years ago certainly not 
infinite humour considering an elderly maiden lady 
berne street a fit and proper subject on whom to
exercise his wit was at the trouble writing a vast
number letters to tradesmen and others magistrates and
professional men ordering from the former various goods
and requiring the advice in a case emergency the
latter appointing the same hour to all attendance so
that in fact at the time mentioned the street to the
annoyonce and astonishment its inhabitants was crowded
with a motley group visitants equestrian and pedestrian
all eagerly pressing forward to their destination the old
lady's place residence in the heterogeneous assemblage
there were seen tradesmen all denominations accompanied
by their porters bearing various articles household
furniture counsellors anticipating fees lawyers engaged
to execute the last will and testament the heroine the
drama and not the least conspicuous an undertaker
preceded by his man with a coffin and to crown the whole
though last not least in our esteem the then lord mayor 
london who at the eager desire the old lady had with
a commendable feeling humanity left his civic dominions
in order to administer in a case danger and difficulty
his consolation and assistance when behold the clue was
unravelled the whole turn'd out an hoax and the author
still remains in nubibus
 and who could have been the artist enquired tallyhoho
nay answered his friend that is impossible to say some one in the
crowd but the secret must remain with himself neither do i think it
would have been altogether prudent his revealing it to his alarmed and
credulous auditory
a ventriloquist observed the squire is so little known in the
country that i had lost all reminiscence his surprising powers
however i shall in future from the occurrence today resist
the obtrusion superstition and in all cases doubtful dilemma
remember the devil in long acrel
well resolved answered dashall and in a few minutes they
gained great russel street bloomsbury without further incident or
interruption
 the child in the hat not long since a waggoner coming
to town with a load hay was overtaken by a stranger who
entered into familiar conversation with him they had not
proneeded far when to the great terror giles jolt a
plaintive cry apparently that a child issued from the
waggon didst hear that mon exclaimed giles the cry was
renewed lord lord an there be na a babe neath the
hay i've be hanged lend us a hand mon to get un out for
god's sake the stranger very promptly assisted in
unloading the waggon but no child was found the hay now
lay in a heap on the road from whence the cry was once more
long and loudly reiterated in eager research giles next
proceeded to scatter the hay over the road the cry still
continuing but when at last he ascertained that the
assumed infantine plaint was all a delusion his hair stood
erect with horror and running rapidly from his companion
announced that he had been associated on the road by the
devil for that none else could play him such a trick it
was not without great difficulty that the people to whom he
told this strange story prevailed on him to return at last
to his waggon and horses he did so with manifest
reluctance to his indescribable relief his infernal
companion hail vanished in the person the ventriloquist
and jolt still believes in the supernatural visitation
 amongst the literary and scientific institutions the metropolis
the british museum situated in great russel street bloomsbury stands
preeminent
entering the spacious court our two friends found a party in waiting
for the conductor the individuals composing this party the
reconnoitering eye dashall observed a trio from whence he
anticipated considerable amusement it was a family triumvirate formed
 an old bachelor whose cent per cent ideas predominated over every
other wheresoever situated or howsoever employed his maiden sister
prim starch and antiquated and their hopeful nephew a
complete coxcomb that is in full possession the requisite
concomitants ignorance and impudence and arrayed in the first style 
the most exquisite dandyism this delectable triumviri had emerged from
their chaotic recess in harbingerlane the exquisite to exhibit his
sweet person along with the other curiosities the museum his maiden
aunt to see as she expressed it the hegipsyian muniments
covered with kerrygleefix and her brother to ascertain whether
independent outlandish baubles gimcracks and gewgaws there was anything
 substantiality with which to enhance the per contra side in the
account current between the british museum and the public
attaching themselves to this respectable trio dashall and tallyhoho
followed with the other visitants the guide whose duty it that
day was to point out the various curiosities this great national
institution
the british museum was established by act parliament in in
pursuance the will sir hans sloane who left his museum to
the nation on condition that parliament should pay l to his
executors and purchase a house sufficiently commodious for it the
parliament acted with great liberality on the occasion several other
valuable collections were united to that sir hans sloane and the
whole establishment was completed for the sum l raised by
lottery at the institution this grand treasury learning it
was proposed that a competent part l the annual sum granted by
parliament for the support the house should be appropriated for
the purchase new books but the salaries necessary for the officers
together with the contingent expenses have always exceeded the
allowance so that the trustees have been repeatedly obliged to
make application to defray the necessary charges
mr timothy surety the before mentioned harbingerlane resident
 cent per cent rumination his accomplished sister tabitha his
exquisite nephew jasper and the redoubtable heroes our eventful
history were now associated in one party and the remaining visitants
were sociably amalgamated in another and each having its separate
conductor both proceeded to the inspection the first and most
valuable collection in the universe
illustration pages british museum
on entering the gate the first objects which attracted attention
were two large sheds defending from the inclemency the seasons a
collection egyptian monuments the whole which were taken from
the french at alexandria in the last war the most curious these
perhaps is the large sarcophagus beneath the shed to the left which
has been considered as the exterior coffin alexander the great used
at his final interment it is formed variegated marble and as mrs
tabitha surety observed was covered with kerrygleefix 
nephew jasper said his uncle you are better acquainted with the
nomenclature i think you call it them there thingumbobs than i
am what is the name this here
my dear sir rejoined the exquisite this here is called a sark o
fergus implying the domicile or rather the windingsheet the
dead as the sark or chemise wound itself round the fair forms the
daughters o'fegus a highland chieftain from whom descended philip
 macedon father alexander the great and thence originated the
name subsequently given by the highland laird's successors to the
dormitory the dead the sark o fergus or in the corruption modern
orthography sarcophagus
timothy surety cast an approving glance towards his nephew and
whispering dashall my nephew sir apparently a puppy sir but well
informed nevertheless what think you his definition that hard
word is he not i mean my nephew jaz a most extraordinary young man
superlatively so answered dashall and i think you are happy in
bearing affinity to a young man such transcendent acquirements
d n his acquirements exclaimed timothy would you think it
they are no use in the way trade and though i have given him many
an opportunity doing well he knows no more keeping a set books
by doubleentry than timothy surety does keeping a pack hounds
who was never twenty miles beyond the hearing bow bells in all his
lifetime
this important communication having been made apart from the
recognition the aunt and nephew passed on their approach
unanswered and dashall and his friend remained in doubt whether or not
the nephew in his late definition the word sarcophagus was in
jest or earnest tallyhoho inclined to think that he was hoaxing the old
gentleman on the other hand his cousin bethought himself that the
apparent ingenuity jaz's definition was attributable entirely to his
ignorance
here also were two statues roman workmanship supposed to be those
 marcus aurelius and severus ancient but evidently provincial
sculpture
mrs tabitha shading her eyes with her fan and casting a glance askew
at the two naked figures which exhibited the perfection symmetry
enquired her nephew who they were meant to represent
his answer was equally eccentric with that accorded to his uncle on the
subject the sarcophagus
my dear madam said jaz these two figures are consanguineous to
those gog and magog in guildhall being the lineal descendants 
these mighty associates the livery london
but jaz rejoined the antique dame i always understood that
messieurs gog and magog derived their origin from quite a different
family
aunt mine responded jaz the lofty rubicund civic baronet
shall not be shorn his beams he claims the same honour with
his brainless brothers before ushe is a scion the same tree sir
wllm the twin brothers guildhall and these two sedate gentlemen
 stone all boast the honour the same extraction
behind them on the right was a ram's head very curious workmanship
from thebes
perhaps sir said mrs tabitha graciously addressing herself to
squire tallyhoho you can inform us what may be the import this
singular exhibition
on my honour madam answered the squire i cannot satisfactorily
resolve the enquiry i am a country gentleman and though
conversant with rains and rams horns in my own neighbourhood have no
knowledge them with reference to the connexion the latter with the
citizens london or westminster
jaz again assumed the office expositor my very reverend aunt
said jaz i must prolegomena the required explanation with a simple
anecdote
when charles the second returned from one his northern tours
accompanied by the earl rochester he passed through shoreditch on
each side the road was a huge pile rams horns for what purpose
tradition saith not what is the meaning all this asked the
king pointing towards the symbolic i know not rejoined rochester
unless it implies that the citizens london have laid their heads
together to welcome your majesty's return in commemoration this
witticism the ram's head is to the citizens london a prominent
feature exhibition in the british museum
this interpretation raised a laugh at the expense timothy surety
who nevertheless bore it with great good humour being a bachelor and
consequently not within the scope that ridicule on the basis which
was founded the present sarcastic fabric
it was now obvious to dash all and his friend that this young man
jasper surety was not altogether the ignoramus at first presumed they
had already been entertained by his remarks and his annotations were
 a description to warrant the expectancy further amusement in the
progress their inspection
from the hall the visitors were led through an iron gateway to the
great staircase opposite the bottom which is preserved a model in
mahogany exhibiting the method used by mr milne in constructing the
works blacksmiths bridge and beneath it are some curious fragments
from the giant's causeway in ireland
these fragments however highly estimated by the naturalist and the
antiquary were held in derision by the worldlyminded tim surety
who exclaimed against the folly expending money in the purchase 
articles no intrinsic value calculated only to gratify the curiosity
 those inquisitive idlers who affect their admiration every
uninteresting production nature and neglect the pursuit the main
chance so necessary in realizing the comforts life
 these sordid ideas were opposed by dashall and the squire to
whom they seemed particularly directed mrs tabitha smiled a gracious
acquiescence in the sentiments the two strangers and jasper
expressed his regret that nuncle was not gifted and fated as midas 
ancient times who transformed every thing that he touched into gold
the egyptian and etruscan antiquities next attracted the attention 
the visitors over a doorway in this room is a fine portrait sir
william hamilton painted by sir joshua reynolds dashall and tallyhoho
remarked with enthusiasm on these beautiful relics the sculpture
 former ages several which were mutilated and disfigured by the
dilapidation time and accident the company present there stood
on the left a diminutive elderly gentleman in the act contemplating
the fragment a statue in a posterior position and which certainly
exhibited somewhat a ludicrous appearance on the right the
exquisite jasper pointed out with the selfsufficiency an amateur
the masculine symmetry a colossian statue to his aunt antiquated
virginity whose maiden purity recoiling from the view notation
seemed to say jaz wrap an apron round him while in the foreground
stood the rotundity form timothy surety who declared after a
cursory and contemptuous glance at the venerable representatives 
mythology that with the exception the portrait sir william
hamilton there was not in the room an object worth looking at and as
for them there ancient statutes such was his vernacular idiom and
harbinger barbarism i would not give twopence for the whole this
here collection if it was never for nothing else than to set them up as
scarecrows in the garden my country house at edmonton
jasper whispered his aunt that nuncks was a vile bore and the
sacrilegious declaration gave great offence to the diminutive gentleman
aforesaid who hesitated not in pronouncing timothy surety destitute 
taste and vertu to which accusation timothy rearing his squat form
to its utmost altitude indignantly replied that there was not an
alderman in the city london better taste than himself in the
qualities callipash and calliope and that if the little penmen
presumed again to asperse his virtue he would bring an action against
him tor slander and defamation character the minikin man gave
timothy a glance ineffable disdain and left the room mrs 
tabitha in the full consciousness her superior acquirements now
directed a lecture edification to her brother who however manfully
resisted her interference and swore that where his taste and
virtue were called in question he would not submit to any she in the
universe
mrs tabitha finding that on the present occasion her usual success
would not predominate suspended like a skilful manoeuvres
unavailable attack and turning to her nephew variety 
shapes than proteus and that he had been only fifty times if not more
confined in different houses correction as an incorrigible rogue
and vagabond from one which he had recently contrived to effect his
escape the officer now bore off his prize in triumph while dashall
hitherto the most observant all observers sustained the laugh
 his cousin at the knowing one deceived with great good humour and
dashall adverting to his opinion so confidently expressed there can
be no deception here declared that in london it was impossible to
guard in every instance against fraud where it is frequently practised
with so little appearance imposition
the two friends now bent their course towards covent garden which
reaching without additional incident they wiled away an hour at
robins's much to their satisfaction that gentleman in his professional
capacity generally attracts in an eminent degree the attention his
visitors by his professional politeness so that he seldom fails to
put off an article to advantage and yet he rarely resorts to the puff
direct and never indulges in the puff figurative so much practised by
his renowned predecessor the late knight the hammer christie the
elder who by the superabundance his rhetorical flurishes was
accustomed from his elevated rostrum to edify and amuse his admiring
auditory
 the immense revenues accruing to his grace the duke bedford
not the least important is that derived from covent garden market as
proprietor the ground from every possessor a shed or stall and
from all who take their station as venders in the market a rent is
payable to his grace and collected weekly considering therefore
the vast number occupants the aggregate rental must be the first
magnitude his grace is a humane landlord and his numerous tenantry
 covent garden are always ready to join in general eulogium on his
private worth as is the nation at large on the patriotism his public
character
dashall conducted his friend through every part the market amidst a
redundancy fruit flowers roots and vegetables native and exotic
in variety and profusion exciting the merited admiration the
squire who observed and perhaps justly that this celebrated emporium
unquestionably is not excelled by any other a similar description in
the universe
 the late mr christie having at one time a small tract 
land under the hammer expatiated at great length on its
highly improved state the exuberant beauties with which
nature had adorned this terrestrial paradise and more
particularly specified a delightful hanging wood
a gentleman unacquainted with mr christie's happy talent
at exaggerated description became the highest bidder paid
his deposit and posted down into essex to examine his new
purchase when to his great surprise and disappointment he
found no part the description realized the promised
paradise having faded into an airy vision and left not a
wreck behind the irritated purchaser immediately returned
to town and warmly expostulated with the auctioneer on the
injury he had sustained by unfounded representation and as
to a hanging wood sir there is not the shadow a tree on
the spot i beg your pardon sir said the pertinacious
eulogist you must certainly have overlooked the gibbet on
the common and if that is not a hanging wood i know not
what it is
another mr christie's flights fancy may not unaptly
be termed the puff poetical at an auction pictures
dwelling in his usual strain eulogium on the unparalleled
excellence a fulllength portrait without his producing
the desired effect gentlemen said he cannot injustice
to this sublime art permit this most invaluable
painting to pass from under the hammer without again
soliciting the honour your attention to its manifold
beauties gentlemen it only wants the touch prometheus
to start from the canvass and fall bidding
 proceeding into leicester square the very extraordinary
production female genius miss logwood's gallery needlework
promised a gratification to the squire exceeding in novelty any thing
which he had hitherto witnessed in the metropolis the two
friends accordingly entered and the anticipations tallyhoho were
superabundantly realized
this exhibition consists seventyfive exquisite copies in needlework
 the finest pictures the english and foreign schools possessing
all the correct drawing just colouring light and shade the original
pictures from whence they are taken and to which in point effect
they are in no degree inferior
from the door in leicester square the visitants entered the principal
room a fine gallery excellent proportions hung with scarlet
broadcloth gold bullion tassels and greek borders the appearance
thus given to the room is pleasing and indicated to the squire a still
more superior attraction his cousin dashall had frequently inspected
this celebrated exhibition but to tallyhoho it was entirely new
on one side this room the pictures are hung and have a guard in
front to keep the company at the requisite distance and for preserving
them
turning to the left a long and obscure passage prepares the mind
and leads to the cell a prison on looking into which is seen the
beautiful lady jane gray visited by the abbot and keeper the tower
the night before her execution
this scene particularly elicited the squire's admiration the deception
 the whole he observed was most beautiful and not exceeded by
any work from the pencil the painter that he had ever witnessed
a little farther on is a cottage the casement which opens and the
hatch at the door is closed and on looking in at either our visitants
perceived a fine and exquisitely finished copy gainsborough's cottage
children standing by the fire with chimneypiece and cottage furniture
compleat near to this is gainsborough's woodman exhibited in the same
scenic manner
having enjoyed an intellectual treat which perhaps in originality as
an exhibition needlework is no where else to be met with our
perambulators retired and reached home without the occurrence any
other remarkable incident

the prison act i scene iii
traversing the streets without having in view any particular object
other than the observance real life in london such as might occur
from fortuitous incident our two perambulators skirted the metropolis
one fine morning till finding themselves in the vicinity 
tothillfields bridewell a place confinement to which the
magistrates westminster provisionally commit those who are supposed
to be guilty crimes ingress was without much difficulty obtained
and the two friends proceeded to a survey human nature in its most
degraded state where amidst the consciousness infamy and the
miseries privation apathy seemed the predominant feeling with these
outcasts society and reflection on the past or anticipation the
future was absorbed in the vacuum insensibility reckless his
destiny here the manacled felon wore with his gyves the semblance
 the most perfect indifference and the seriousness useful
retrospection was lost in the levity frivolous amusement apart from
the other prisoners was seated a recluse whose appearance excited the
attention the two visitants a deep cloud dejection overshadowed
his features and he seemed studiously to keep aloof from the
obstreperous revelry his fellowcaptives there was in his manner
a something inducing a feeling commiseration which could not be
extended to his callous companions in adversity his decayed
habiliment indicated from its formation and texture that he had seen
better days and his voluntary seclusion confirmed the idea that he
had not been accustomed to his present humiliating intercourse his
intenseness thought precluded the knowledge approximation on his
privacy until our two friends stood before him he immediately rose
made his obeisance and was about to retire when mr dashall with
his characteristic benevolence begged the favour a few moments
conversation
i am gratified he observed in perceiving one exception to the
general turpitude feeling which seems to pervade this place and
i trust that your case distress is not a nature to preclude
the influence hope in sustaining your mind against the pressure 
despondency
the cause my confinement answered the prisoner is originally
that debt although perverted into crime by an unprincipled
relentless creditor destined to the misery losing a beloved wife
and child and subsequently assailed by the minor calamity pecuniary
embarrassment i inevitably contracted a few weeks arrears rent to
the rigid occupant the house wherein i held my humble apartment
when returned one night to my cheerless domicil my irascible landlord
in the plenitude ignorance and malevolence gave me in charge a
sapient guardian the night who without any enquiry into the nature
 my offence conducted me to the watchhouse where i was presently
confronted with my creditor who accused me the heinous crime 
getting into his debt the constable very properly refused to take
cognizance a charge so ridiculous but unluckily observing that had
i been brought there on complaint an assault he would in that case
have felt warranted in my detention my persecutor seized on the idea
with avidity and made a declaration to that effect although evidently
no such thought had in the first instance occurred to him well knowing
the accusation to be grossly unfounded this happened on a saturday
night and i remained in dress and without sustenance until the
following monday when i was held before a magistrate the alleged
assault was positively sworn to and maugre my statement the
suspicious inconsistent conduct my prosecutor i was immured in the
lockup house for the remainder the day on the affidavit 
perjury and in the evening placed under the friendly care the
governor tothillfields bridewell to abide the issue at the next
westminster sessions
this is a most extraordinary affair said the squire and what do you
conjecture may be the result
the pertinacity my respectable prosecutor said the captive might
probably induce him to procure the aid some his conscientious
israelitish brethren whom never saw towards substantiating the
aforesaid assault by manfully swearing to the fact but as i have no
desire exhibiting myself through the streets linked to a chain 
felons on our way to the sessions house i believe i shall contrive
to pay the debt due to the perjured scoundrel which will ensure my
enlargement and let the devil in due season take his own
may we enquire said dashall without the imputation impertinent
inquisitiveness what has been the nature your pursuits in life
multitudinous replied the other my life has been so replete
with adventure and adversity in all its varieties and in its future
prospects so unpropitious happiness that existence has long ceased
to be desirable and had i not possessed a more than common portion 
philosophic resignation i must have yielded to despair but
when all the blandishments life are gone the coward sneaks to
death the brave live on
thirty years ago i came to london buoyant youth and hope to
realize a competency although i knew not by what means the grand
object was to be attained yet it occurred to me that i might be equally
successful with others my country who unaided by recommendation and
united with the means speculation had accumulated fortunes in
this fruitful metropolis and whom fifteen years ago one eminently
fortunate adventurer from the north filled the civic chair with
commensurate political zeal and ability
some are born great others achieve greatness and some have greatness
thrust upon them
well sir what can be said it i was without the pale fortune
although several my schoolmates who had established themselves
in london acquired by dint perseverance parsimony and servility
affluent circumstances convinced however that i was not
destined to acquire wealth and honour and being unsolved even with
the necessaries life i abandoned in london all hope success and
emigrated to ireland where i held for several years the situation 
clerk to a respectable justice the quorum in this situation i lived
well and the perquisites office which were regularly productive on
the return every fair and market day for taking examinations the
peace and filling up warrants apprehension against the perpetrators
 broken heads and bloody noses consoled me in my voluntary exile
from real life in london i was in all respects regarded as one the
family had a horse at my command visited in friendly intimacy the
neighbouring gentry and above all enjoyed the eccentricities the
lower irish most particularly so when before his honour detailing to
his great annoyance a story an hour long about a tester sixpence
and if he grew impatient attributing it to some secret prejudice which
he entertained against them
 their method is to get a story completely by heart and to
tell it as they call it out the face that is from the
beginning to the without interruption
well my good friend i have seen you lounging about these
three hours in the yard what is your business
phase your honour it is what i want to speak one word to
your honour
speak then but be quick what is the matter
the matter plase your honour is nothing at all at all
only just about the grazing a horse phase your honour
that this man here sold me at the fair gurtishannon last
shrove fair which lay down three times with myself phase
your honour and kilt me not to be telling your honour 
how no later back than yesterday night he lay down in the
house there within and all the children standing round and
it was god's mercy he did not fall atop them or into
the fire to burn himself so phase your honour today i
took him back to this man which owned him and after a
great deal to do i got the mare again i swopped exchanged
him for but he won't pay the grazing the horse for the
time i had him though he promised to pay the grazing incase
the horse didn't answer and he never did a day's work
good or bad phase your honour all the time he was with me
and i had the doctor to him five times any how and so
phase your honour it is what i expect your honour will
stand my friend for i'd sooner come to your honour for
justice than to any other in all ireland and so i brought
him here before your honour and expect your honour will
make him pay me the grazing or tell me can i process him
for it at the next assizes phase your honour
the defendant now turning a quid tobacco with his
tongue into some secret cavern in his mouth begins his
defence with
phase your honour under favour and saving your honour's
presence there's not a word truth in all this man has
been saying from beginning to upon my conscience and i
would not for the value the horse itself grazing and
all be after telling your honour a lie for phase your
honour i have a dependance upon your honour that you'll dome
justice and not be listening to him or the like him
phase your honour it is what he has brought me before your
honour because he had a spite against me about some oats i
sold your honour which he was jealous and a shawl his
wife got at my sister's shop there without and never paid
for so i offered to set the shawl against the grazing and
give him a receipt in full all demands but he wouldn't
out spite phase your honour so he brought me before
your honour expecting your honour was mad with me for
cutting down the tree in the horse park which was none 
my doing phase your honour ill luck to them that went
and belied me to your honour behind my back so if your
honour is pleasing i'll tell you the whole truth about the
horse that he swopped against my mare out the face
last shrove fair i met this man jemmy duffy phase your
honour just at the corner the road where the bridge is
broke down that your honour is to have the present for this
year long life to you for it and he was at that time
coming from the fair gurtishannon and the same way
how are you jemmy says i very well i thank you
bryan says he shall we turn back to paddy salmon's and
take a naggin whiskey to our better acquaintance i
don't care if i did jemmy says i only it is what i
can't take the whiskey because i'm under an oath against it
for a month ever since phase your honour the day your
honour met me on the road and observed to me i could hardly
stand i had taken so much though upon my conscience your
honour wronged me greatly that same time ill luck to them
that belied me behind my back to your honour well phase
your honour as i was telling you as he was taking the
whiskey and we talking one thing or t'other he makes mean
offer to swop his mare that he couldn't sell at the fair
 gurtishannou because nobody would be troubled with the
beast phase your honour against my horse and to oblige
him i took the mare sorrow take her and him along with
her she kicked me a new car that was worth three pounds
ten to tatters the first time i ever put her into it and
i expect your honour will make him pay me the price the
car any how before i pay the grazing which i have no
right to pay at all at all only to oblige him but i leave
it all to your honour and the whole grazing he ought to be
charging for the beast is but two and eight pence halfpenny
any how phase your honour so i'll abide by what your
honour says good or bad i'll leave it all to your honour
i'll leave it all to your honour literally means i'll
leave all the trouble to your honour
but this pleasant life was not decreed much longer to endure
the insurrection broke out during which an incident occurred that had
nearly terminated all my then cares in this life past present and to
come
in my capacity as clerk or secretary i had written one morning for
the worthy magistrate two letters both containing remittances the one
l and the other l in bank ireland bills we were situated at
the distance fifteen miles from the nearest market town and as the
times were perilous and my employer unwilling to entrust property to the
precarious conveyance subordinate agency he requested that i would
take a morning ride and with my own hands deliver these letters at
the postoffice accordingly i set out and had arrived to within three
miles my destination when my further progress was opposed by two
men in green uniform who with supported arms and fixed bayonets
were pacing the road to and fro as sentinels in a very steady and
soldierlike manner on the challenge one these fellows with arms
at port demanding the countersign i answered that i had none to give
that i was travelling on lawful business to the next town and required
to know by what authority he stopt me on the king's highway by the
powers he exclaimed this is my authority then and immediately
brought his musket to the charge against the chest my horse i now
learnt that the town had been taken possession that morning by a
division the army the people for so the insurgents had styled
themselves you may turn your nag homewards if you choose said the
sentry but if you persist in going into the town i must pass you by
the different outposts to the officer on duty the business in which
i was engaged not admitting delay i preferred advancing and was
ushered ultimately to the notice the captain the guard who
very kindly informed me that his general would certainly order me to be
hanged as a spy unless i could exhibit good proof the contrary with
this comfortable assurance i was forthwith introduced into the presence
 the rebel general he was a portly goodlooking man apparently about
the age forty not more wore a green uniform with gold embroidery
and was engaged in signing dispatches which his secretary successively
sealed and superscribed his staff were in attendance and a
provostmarshal in waiting to perform the office summary execution on
those to whom the general might attach suspicion the insurgent leader
now enquiring with much austerity my name profession from
whence i came the object my coming and lastly whether or not i
was previously aware the town being in possession the army the
people i answered these interrogatories by propounding the question
who the gentleman was to whom i had the honour addressing myself
and under what authority i was considered amenable to his inquisition
answer my enquiries sir he replied without the impertinency 
idle circumlocution otherwise i shall consider you as a spy and my
provostmarshal shall instantly perform on your person the duties 
his office i now resorted to my letters i had no other alternative
between existence and annihilation explaining therefore who i
was and by whom employed these letters i added are each in my
handwriting and both contain remittances i came to this town for the
sole purpose putting them into the postoffice and i was not aware
until informed by your scouts that the place was in the occupation 
an enemy he deigned not a reply farther than pointing to one 
the letters and demanding to know the amount the bill which it
enveloped i answered one hundred and fifty pounds he immediately
broke the seal examined the bill and found that it was correct now
sir he continued sit down and write from my dictation he dictated
from the letter which he had opened and when i had finished the
copy compared it next with the original characters expressed his
satisfaction at their identity and returning the letters licensed my
departure when and to where i list observing that i was fortunate in
having had with me those testimonials business otherwise said he
your appearance under circumstances suspicion might have led to a
fatal result you may be assured gentlemen continued the narrator
that i did not prolong my stay in the town beyond the shortest
requisite period two mounted dragoons by order their general
escorted me past the outposts and i reached home in safety these
occurrences took place on a saturday the triumph the insurgent
troops was short duration they were attacked that same night by the
king's forces discomfited and their daring chieftain taken prisoner
on the monday following his head stuck upon a pike surmounted the
markethouse belfast the scenes anarchy and desperation in which
that unfortunate country became now involved rendered it no very
desirable residence i therefore procured a passport bid adieu to the
emerald isle erin ma vorneen shan leet go brag and once more returned
to london to experience a renewal that misfortune by which i have
with little interval been hitherto accompanied during the whole period
 my eventful life
the two strangers had listened to the narrative with mingled sensations
 compassion and surprise the one feeling excited by the peculiarity
the other by the pertinacity his misfortunes when their cogitations
were interrupted by a dissonant clamour amongst the prisoners who it
appeared had united in enmity against an unlucky individual whom they
were dragging towards the discipline the pump with all the eagerness
 inflexible vengeance
on enquiry into the origin this uproar it was ascertained that one
 the prisoners under a charge slight assault had been visited by
this fellow who affecting to commiserate his situation proposed to
arrange matters with his prosecutor for his immediate release with
other offers gratuitous assistance this pretended friend was
recognised by one the prisoners as a kidnapper
a kidnapper or crimp is one those fellows abandoned principles
who enter into the pay the east india company in order to recruit
their army and when a guinea or two is advertised to be given to any
person that brings a proper man five feet eight or nine inches high
lie in wait to entrap men for the money some these gentry assume
the character officers others serjeants drummers and recruits
without the least shadow commission among them they have many
ways inveigling the artless and unthinking one or two these
kidnappers dressed as countrymen go five or six miles out town to
meet the waggons and stages and enquire if john suchaone is come up
which is answered in the negative no such person being known they
then enter into discourse with the countrymen and being perfectly
complaisant engage attention and by the time they get to london learn
their occupations and business to town whether they are in search 
places trades or intend to return home again which intelligence
they in general profit by coming to the place rendezvous the 
kidnappers propose a pint porter which being agreed on they enter
the house where their companions are in waiting enjoy themselves overflowing
bowls and exhilarating their spirits with loyal toasts and
songs begin their business by enquiring who is willing to serve his
majesty the countryman if inclined thereto is generally deceived if
his desire is for the guards or any other particular regiment there
are at hand mock serjeants and privates who will swear they belong to
the corps and the dupe is trepanned for the east indies hurried onboard
a ship or kept in some dismal place security till a sufficient
number is collected and an opportunity serves to send them away
on the other hand should the countryman be averse to enlisting and
talk going away these crimps will swear that he has received a
shilling or more the bountymoney insisting that they saw him put
the money into such and such a pocket it is in vain that the countryman
denies having received it search is made money found and he is
compelled to submit or pay the smart
others again these prowlers frequent the places confinement and
learning the particular case some prisoner for small debt or slight
assault kindly otter to mediate with the prosecutor or creditor
in effecting liberation the pretended friend assumes the most
disinterested feeling sympathy ingratiates himself into confidence
and generally terminates his machinations with success accomplishes the
prisoner's release and sends him ultimately from temporary dress to
perpetual exile
such was the character the fellow now placed in the ominous guidance
 an exasperated multitude they urged him forward to the place 
punishment but the tumultuary assemblage were disappointed in their
anticipated vengeance by the interposition the turnkeys and the
pretended friend escaped the meditated castigation
observe again said the narrator that dashing young fellow arrayed
in the first style dandyism
my good fellow interrupted bob he is not i should think one 
the community he has apparently the manners the well bred and
accomplished gentleman and for that very reason sir is the better
qualified to carry on his profession with impunity he whom you
dignify with the appellation a well bred and accomplished gentleman
is all that you have expressed him with the exception one word
that is substitute for gentleman swindler and the character is justly
delineated this fellow desperate enterprize is one the numerous
practitioners knavery who set themselves up for men property
and integrity the more easily to defraud the unwary and ignorant out 
their substance and effects this spark connecting himself with several
others similar pursuit they took a genteel house in a respectable
part the town and dividing themselves into classes masters
clerks outriders shorten porters and servants and thus making
a show opulence they easily obtained credit and laid in goods 
every kind which they sent into the country and sold or bartered for
other commodities these commodities they brought up to london and sold
for ready money generally taking in exchange double the quantity and
paying for the same with notes their own drawing indorsing and
fabricating for the purpose cheating the poor deluded farmer
shopkeeper and tradesman in the interior the country with respect
to tradesmen in town the goods they took them on trust they disposed
 to jews and other receivers stolen goods at about thirty percent
under value for ready money nay forty per cent rather than not
have the cash and as their stay in one place could not safely exceed
five months on account their creditors calling in their debts
and their country notes becoming due they used to make all possible
dispatch to dispose the various articles and evacuate the premises
before detection this done they played the same game elsewhere when
proteus like they changed shapes and disguised themselves so as
not to be known and carried on business in another house but in a
different name the master became the rider the rider the master the
clerks descended to footmen and porters the footmen to porters and
clerks and so on throughout until they had drained many parts the
town and country to the ruin several worthy and honest families
however the copartnership is now dissolved the establishment is broke
up and the different individuals this nefarious gang depredators
 whom the well bred and accomplished gentleman the subject our
remarks is one the principals are consigned to different
gaols for further examination and final commitment
dashall expressed thanks for the interesting communication and the
squire his astonishment that the credulity man could warrant the hope
 success to such a combination however systematically arranged and
where so many were concerned and the distribution plunder perhaps by
no means equalized that some dissatisfied individual did not renounce
the dangerous connection in the hope impunity and reward
we know not that there is any subordinate division spoil said the
other but if such there be it may in this union interests be the
maxim as with other copartnership concerns that he by whatsoever
means who contributes the most to the general stock shall participate
the most in the general benefit
swindlers have other means cheating and tricking the public such
as answering the advertisements tradesmen who are in want a sum to
make good a payment and offering in consideration a small premium
to get them the money required on their note hand which they
premise must be first given and the money will be immediately advanced
the necessitated person agrees to the terms and unthinkingly gives
his note which one the swindlers carries away with a promise a
speedy return with the money wanted but neither swindler nor note
is forthcoming until it becomes due after having passed through
many different hands some whom can ascertain giving a valuable
consideration for the same and fix the drawer to the payment whose
consolation for his credulity is paying the money or going to prison
in case a stagnation trade the swindlers advertise themselves to
borrow or lend upon good security if they borrow they have sham deeds
and make false conveyance estates in nubibus nobody knows where
if they lend they artfully inveigle the borrower out his security
which they take up money upon and convert to their own use without
the deluded person's knowledge and by absconding leave him to the
mortification descanting on their roguery and his own want 
foresight
 the triumvirate were once more interrupted a newcomer had
arrived and the prisoners hailed his initiation with the first stanza
 an old song
welcome welcome brother debtor
to this poor but merry place
where no bailiff dun nor setter
dares to shew his frightful face
but kind sir as you're a stranger
down your garnish you must lay
else your coat will be in danger
you must either strip or pay
 setters this appellation is applicable to others than
thosealluded to in the above stanza as connected with duns
and bailiffs they are a dangerous set wretches who are
capable committing any villany as well by trepanning a
rich heir into matrimony with a castoff mistress or common
prostitute as by coupling a young heiress with a notorious
sharper down to the lowest scene setting debtors for the
bailiff and his followers smitten with the first glance 
the lady you resign your heart the conjugal knot is tied
and like the copper captain you find the promised land
houses and furniture the property another and not 
yourself
the novitiate neither surprised at his reception nor adverse to the
custom the place seemed quite at home paid his garnish without
hesitation and entered at once into the vacuum indifference with his
new associates
the attention dashall and tallyhoho was attracted by the clank 
fetters as one the prisoners squatted himself on the pavement 
the yard leaning his back against the wall he commenced darning an old
stocking chanting at same time an old song from the beggar's opera
as if predicting his own fate yet with a manner indicating the most
callous indifference
since laws were made for every degree
to curb vice in others as well as in me
i wonder we hasn't better company
upon tyburn tree
but gold from law can take out the sting
and if rich men like us were to swing
twould thin the land such numbers would string
upon tyburn tree
the irreclaimable depravity this man could not excite any urgent
feeling sympathy in his behalf and our two friends took no further
notice him
 their intelligencer who in the meanwhile had gone forth for
information now advancing i thought said he that i had seen
elsewhere this johnny newcome he is a sharper another precious
addition to our respectable community
respectable indeed exclaimed tallyhoho as he detected an urchin thief
in the act picking his pocket his handkerchief this hopeful imp
though young in years was experienced in iniquity had served an active
apprenticeship to the art picking pockets with impunity
 the sharper who has generally had a genteel education is
a person good address and conversation has more the
power delusion at will than the unlettered cheat devoid
 address and other requisites to complete the pretended
gentleman and therefore should be more carefully avoided
these villains having run through their fortunes at an
early period life by associating with professed gamblers
and sharpers who having eased them their money in
return complete them for the profession by which they have
been ruined set up for themselves throw aside honour and
conscience and quote the lex talionis for deceiving others
as they themselves have been deceived these gentry are to
be met with at horseraces cockfights the billiard and
hazard tables and at all public places diversion on
your entering the coffeehouse tavern or gaminghouse the
sharper views you with attention and is not long before he
becomes acquainted and very intimate with you if you agree
to his proposal to play if he cannot beat you by fair he
will by foul means rather than lose he will elude your
attention and raise your passion sufficiently to put you
off your guard while he plays his underhand game and
cheats you before your face and though you are sensible 
being cheated yet you shall not be able to discover by what
means it is effected the various methods sharpers have to
cheat and deceive are so many and unaccountable that it
would exceed the limits our publication to detail even
the tenthpart them their study is to supply their
exigencies by means within their power however wicked or
villanous if you associate with sharpers you must not only
expect but deserve to be cheated by them for your
credulity for who would go with his eyes open into a den 
thieves but in expectation being robbed or who would
herd with sharpers and not expect to be cheated we would
therefore advise the stranger in london to shun these
reptiles the creation fraught with guile and artful as
the serpent to delude beware their conversation avoid
their company take no notice their tricks nor be caught
by their wheedling professions friendship listen not to
any their enticements if you would preserve your peace
and property be not fond making new acquaintance with
persons you do not know however genteel in appearance and
behaviour for many a villain lurks under the disguise a
modern fine gentleman and if any stranger asks you to play
with him for money set him down in your mind as a sharper
and leave the room immediately
and at last became so great an adept in the profession that at
the early age thirteen years he was unanimously elected captain 
an organized band juvenile depredators some much younger none older
than himself who for a considerable length time set at defiance the
vigilance the police these young fry carried on a long protracted
successful war extermination against ladies reticule one urchin
watching her approach would lay himself across the path she must pass
and it frequently happened that she tumbled over him a grab was then
made at the reticule the watch and the shawl with which the young
villains generally got clear off others in detachments two or
three would hover about the door or window a tradesman's shop cut
out a pane glass and abstract some valuable trinket or watch the
retirement the shopkeeper into his backroom when one the most
enterprizing would enter on hands and knees crawl round the counter
with the stillness death draw out the till with its contents and
bear off the spoil with impunity one night however luckily for the
public the whole gang was made prisoners and dispersed to various
gaols each delinquent being ordered a severe flogging and solitary
confinement availing himself this indulgence the captain had
watched the opportunity approximating towards tallyhoho and was
detected as we said before in the exercise his former propensities
so difficult it is to eradicate vice from the human mind even though
in this instance so early implanted lenity in this case would have been
equally misplaced as unjust although the squire humanely pressed his
intercession the incorrigible pilferer was therefore handed over to
the custody one the turnkeys until the governor might award a
punishment suitable to the heinousness the offence
the two friends had been here above an hour it was an hour they thought
not idly spent and now leaving a small donation for distribution
amongst such as appeared deserving objects they returned home gratified
by the additional knowledge acquired real life in london 
chapter iii
would you see
the debtors world confide yourself to me
come safely shall you pass the fatal door
nor fear it shuts you in to ope no more
see frowning grimly o'er the borough road
the crossing spikes that crown the dark abode
o how that iron seems to pierce the soul
 him whom hurrying wheels to prison roll
what time from serjeants inn some debtor pale
the tipstaff renders in default bail
black shows that grisly ridge against the sky
as near he draws and lifts an anxious eye
then on his bosom each peculiar spike
arm'd with its proper ill appears to strike
the recollection past enjoyments in the vivacious company merry
well could not fail to be revived in the minds dashall and his
cousin and as some persons with due attention to his safety had
manifested their interest and regard for him by obtaining his admission
to the priory where he was at this moment pursuing his studies
and could not quite so conveniently call on them an early visit was
determined on
we shall said tom by a call on merrywell after six weeks residence
among the gay blades that inhabit the walls the king's bench
have all the benefit his previous observation he will be able to
delineate the characters consciences and conduct his neighbours
he will describe all the comforts and advantages a college life
introduce us to the bloods and the blacks and in short there are few
persons i know except sparkle himself more able to conduct us through
the intricacies the building to point out the beauty and excellence
 the establishment its uses and abuses than merrywell
do they charge any thing on admittanceenquired bob
o yes was the reply they charge you by a public notice in
the lobby not to convey into the interior any spirituous liquors on
pain being yourself discharged from thence and confined elsewhere
bless your soul why the king's bench is a little world within itself
a sort epitome london it is in a healthy situation and the space
which it occupies is extensive there are in all rooms and they
measure each about or feet by or these eight are called
staterooms are much larger than the rest and more commodious and
a wellbreeches customer may have almost any accommodation it is the
prison most immediately belonging to the court king's bench and
exclusive debtors there sued all persons standing in contempt
 that court and most those committed under its sentence are
confined
and pretty generally all inhabited interrogated tallyhoho
yes and frequently it is difficult to obtain a place to sleep in even
as a chum
bob found himself at fault and required an explanation the word
chum
the chum replied dashall is a partner or bedfellow a person
who has an equal right to all the comforts and conveniences a room
previously wholly in the possession one
i understand said bob then when every room has already one
occupant they accommodate him with a companion
exactly so and he may prove friend or foe this however may be
avoided if the student is in possession the rubbish by an escape
into the rules which extend for three miles round the priory these
rules are purchaseable after the following rate viz ten guineas for
the first hundred pounds and about half that sum for every hundred
pounds afterwards dayrules which three may be obtained in every
term may be purchased for s d for the first day and s d for
the rest each also must give good security to the marshal
the fiction the law supposes
that every prisoner with means to pay
for he that has not this advantage loses
either has business in the courts or may
bond fee and sureties fresh prepare the way
and mister broothoft's manual sign declares
that mister suchaone on such a day
hath got a rule court and so repairs
to town or elsewhere call'd by his affairs
this little talisman strange effect
four shillings just and sixpence is the price
from bailiff's power the wearer will protect
and nullify a capias in a trice
it bears a royal head in quaint device
at least as true as that which wellesley pole
with taste for english artists much too nice
stamp'd by pistrucci's aid heaven rest his soul
and shield henceforth the mint from his controul
in various ways the various purchasers
that sally forth with this protecting spell
employ the privilege this grant confers
some like myself their lawyer's citadel
besiege his speed long striving to impel
to take a dinner with a friend some go
in fashion's haunts some for an hour to swell
some strive what creditors intend to know
and some the moments on their love bestow
thus you have a full true and particular as well as amusing account
 a day rule or what in the cant language the day is termed hiring
a horse which sometimes proves a bolter
and what is meant by a bolter
he is one replied dashall who having obtained the privilege a
day rule brushes off and leaves his bondsmen or the marshal to
pay his debt or one who transgresses the bounds but such a one when
retaken usually undergoes some discipline from the inhabitants the
college who being all honourable men set their faces against such
ungentlemanlike proceedings
then they do sometimes make an escape
yes notwithstanding their restrictive arrangements such things have
occurred and you must recollect that lord cochrane confined for
the memorable stock exchange hoax the means by which it was effected
i believe have never been discovered but certain it is that he was in
the house commons while a prisoner in the king's bench and on the
first night his subsequent liberation gave the casting vote against
a proposed grant to a certain duke
i remember it very well and also remember that the generality 
thinking persons considered his lordship harshly treated
 however he is now bravely fighting the battles independence
increasing both his fame and fortune while some the ministerial
hirelings are subjected to a similar privation we shall have a view 
some the residents in this renowned place fashionable resort the
interior which perhaps exhibits a spectacle far more diversified
and if possible more immoral and vicious than the exterior there are
quondam gentlemen fortune reduced either so low as not to be able to
pay for the rules or so unprincipled and degraded as to have no friend
at command who could with safety become their surety shopkeepers
whose knavery having distanced even their extravagance dread the
appearance ease exhibited in the rules and the detection fraud
by producing the reverse their independence and who even grudge
the expenditure money to obtain limited liberty
certificates bankrupts and unconnected felons jews gamblers by
trade horsedealers money scriveners bill discounters annuity
procurers disinterested profligates unemployed and branded
attorneys scandal mongers and libel writers gazetted publicans
and the perhaps less culpable sinners broken officers reduced
mechanics starving authors and castoff cyprians
a very comprehensive and animated account truly said tallyhoho
and you will find it accurate continued dashall for the turnout 
this dwelling crime and misery resembles the piazza de sant marco at
venice in the carnival time there are all descriptions and classes in
society all casts and sects all tribes and associations all colours
complexions and appearances not only human and inhuman beings but
also all shades features and conformations vice the spendthrift
or degraded man fortune lives by shifts by schemes by loans by
sponging on the novice by subscription or on commiseration's uncertain
aid he has however in perspective some visionary scheme emolument
and dishonour blended to put into execution as soon as he obtains his
discharge the certificates bankrupt has many opportunities left yet
he has other dupes other tricks trade other resources in reserve
the swindler mellows refines and sublimates his plan future
operations and associates in it perchance a fallen fair one oran
incipient greek put up in the bench horsedealers money
scriveners bill doers attorneys c have either the means setting
up again or some new system roguery to be put in practice in fresh
time and place which may conduct them to the harbour fortune or
waft them over the herring pond at the expence the public purse the
disinterested profligate here either consumes corrupts and festers
under the brandy fever and despair or is put up by a gambler who sells
his art to his brother debtors and thus lives in hope yet turning
the honest penny in imitation those who have gone before him the
cyprian still exercising her allurements lingers and decays
until persecution loses the point its arrow and drops from the
persecutor's hand grasping more hardly after money and opening from
the clenched attitude revenge then to conclude the picture there
are youths living upon the open infamy easyhearted women who
disgrace and ruin themselves without the walls in order to pamper the
appetite and humour the whims a favourite within thus sacrificing
one victim to another partners carrying on trade in the world
communing with their incarcerated partners in durance vile misery and
extravagance rude joy and frantic fear with more passions than the
celebrated collins ever drew and with more scenes adventures and
vicissitudes than ever jonathan wild or any other jonathan exhibited
excellent description exclaimed bob
and you shall have ocular demonstration its absolute existence nay
this sketch might serve for many other places confinement the fleet
c they are like the streets the metropolis constantly varying in
their company according to entrances and exits their visitors
this however continued the hon tom dashall is rather a mental
picture what we shall presently witness in reality a sort 
introductory sketch by way passport through the doors this
panorama real life to which you will shortly be introduced a sort
 ideal or dramatic sketch its inhabitants en masse before the
drawing up the curtain
the eagerness bob to listen to his cousin's sketches london
society on the one hand and the earnestness with which dashall
had been exercising his imaginary powers on the other had led our
perambulators to the foot blackfriar's bridge on their road
to the king's bench without any particular circumstance exciting their
attention when bob suddenly twitching his cousin by the arm and
directing his eye at the same time to a thin spare figure a man
without hat or coat who was rapidly passing towards fleet market
enquired who it was and what was his occupation or calling
don't you hear his calling was the reply
hot hot hot pudding hot was in a moment vociferated in his ears
while the active and industrious mercantile pedestrian with a swing 
his head which was in continual motion from right to left gave bob a
wipe in the eye with his tail which by the velocity the wearer was
kept in full play like the pendulum a clock or the tail matthews
in his admirable delineation sir fretful plagiary
zounds cries bob it is true i may hear but i can't pretend to say
i can see who the devil is he there is no looking at him he seems to
leave time and space behind him where is he
tom laughed heartily while bob rubbed his eyes in vain to obtain
another view
that said dashall is a sort commissary a dealer in stores for
the stomach red hot pudding all hot and commonly called the flying
pieman
 james sharpe eglaud more commonly known in the streets 
the metropolis by the appellation the flying pitman may
fairly be held forth as an example what may be effected
by persevering industry and activity especially in a large
and populous city those qualities joined with a moderate
share prudence cannot fail to ensure to every man at
least comfort and respectability it not competence and
wealth however humble his sphere and however unpromising
his beginnings he was bred to the sedentary trade a
tailor and worked for some years with his relation mr
canterbury friday street cheapside but love which
works so many changes and which has ere now transformed
blacksmiths into painters and which induced hercules to
exchange his club for the distaff caused this knight the
steel bar to relinquish the shopboard and patch up his
fortune by the pattypan he married his landlady a widow
who resided in turnmill street clerkenwell he had a soul
above buttons and abandoned the making garments to cover
the outside in order to mould cakes pies and other small
pastry to comfort the internals his active genius
however could not brook the tedious task serving his
customers behind the counter he therefore took up his
eatables and went abroad in quest them and we doubt not
he has found this practice which he has continued ever
since very profitable the neatness and cleanliness his
appearance at all times are truly pleasing hail rain or
shine he may be seen abroad without coat or hat his hair
powdered his shirt sleeves turned up to his elbows and a
steel hanging on his apronstring originally he carried a
tin case something like a dutch oven in which he
constantly kept a lire but is now generally seen with a
small tray in serving a customer he never touches his
pudding with his hands but has a knife for the purpose 
presenting it to the purchasers and his sale is so
extensive that he is obliged to replenish several times ina
day and in order to secure a regular and ready supply
his female partner and himself convey a quantity pudding
to a certain distance and deposit their load at some
publichouse where she takes care to keep it all hot
while egland scours the neighbourhood in search 
customers the first cargo being disposed he returns for
more and by this method he has it always fresh and is
never in want goods
many laughable anecdotes are told this flying pitman and
perhaps a day's excursion in following him during his
peregrinations would furnish much curious and interesting
amusement we shall however select one authenticated by his
appearance at marlborough street police office on monday
july as most intimately connected with real life in
london when he preferred a serious charge against a beggar
no other than the president a smoking club in the holy
land and others for stealing his mutton pies cutting off
his tail and otherwise disfiguring his person by the
evidence egland it appeared that he was introduced with
his goods for sale to a company chiefly consisting 
street beggars in st giles's the chair at that moment
being filled by a beggar without hands well known in the
vicinity the admiralty as a chalked the pavement the
dignity the chair was well sustained by this ingenious
coloured who was smoking a pipe as great as an alderman
over a bason turtle soup but no sooner did egland make
his appearance than the company seized upon his goods and
crammed them down their throats in spite the repeated
vociferations honour honour gentlemen from the
assailed resistance was vain and egland in this dilemma
began to consider that his only safety lay in flight this
however he found equally impracticable he was detained
and by way consolation for his loss was called upon fora
song his lungs were good and although his spirits were
not much exhilarated by the introductory part the
entertainment he began to tip em a stave but whilst he
was chanting the stormy winds do blow a fellow cut off
his tail this was worse than all the rest it was as it
were a part his working tools and the loss it was
likely to injure his business by an alteration his
appearance and could not be tacitly submitted to
the magistrates gravely considering this a most serious
charge unprovoked attack upon an industrious individual
ordered the parties to find bail in default fully
satisfying the inoffensive dealer in pastry which was
accordingly done
in the year scorning to be behindhand in loyalty as
well as activity he became a member the clerkenwell
volunteers and was placed in the light company in which
capacity he obtained the character not only being the
cleanest man but the best soldier in the regiment
it is said that for amusement or the gratification a
whim he will sometimes walk a distance fifty or a
hundred miles from the metropolis and return the same way
on such occasions he always manages to take some companion
or friend out with him but was never known to come back in
the same company for so irresistibly are they allured
forward by his inexhaustible fund humour and
sprightliness conversation that they seldom think the
distance till they find themselves too far from home to
return on foot
then said bob he is not like some the london dealers who
invite their customers to taste and try before they buy for he scarcely
seems to afford a chance seeing what he sells
you did not try him replied tom nor would he have expected you to
be a customer he is a remarkable character well known all over the
metropolis particularly noted for his activity in disposing 
his goods never standing still for a moment but accosting with
extraordinary ease and fluency every person who appears likely to be a
purchaser always ready with an answer to any question but delivering
it with so much volubility that it is impossible to propose a second
enquiry suiting at the same time his answer to the apparent quality
 the querist though frequently leaving it unfinished in search a
customer and moving on with so much rapidity that you may almost find
him at the same moment at tower hill billingsgate and spa fields at
smithfield temple bar and piccadilly indeed he may be said to be in
all quarters the town in a space time incredibly short for a man
who obtains a livelihood by seeking customers as he moves along
zounds cried bob this walking genius this credible incredible
and visible invisible pedestrian dealer in portable eatables has almost
blinded me
for by this flying pitman
i've nearly lost an eye man
come said tom i've no fear your eye while you can muster a
couplet so let us proceed
crossing black friars bridge and approaching the road bob who had
assuaged the pain which he had previously been complaining
could not help admiring the extensive range houses on each side 
the way terminated by a handsome building in the distance
that building said dashall will be the extent our journey for
very near to it is the habitation merrywell where i entertain no
doubt you will find enough for observation a useful as well asa
humorous nature for an epitome men and manners is there to be
obtained
here are abundance subjects worthy inspection in this quarter
replied tom and we therefore ought not to exhaust too much time on
one so let us proceed do you see that high wall to the right that is
the magdalen hospitality established for the relief and
 the magdalen hospital in blacksmiths road enclosed from
public view occupies an extensive space ground and is
from the nature its inhabitants very properly so
enclosed it was opened in the year and it must be a
delightful reflection to its governors that during the
period it has subsisted more than twothirds the women
who have been admitted have been reconciled to their
friends or placed in honest employments or reputable
services besides which a very considerable portion have
since been married and are at this moment respectable
members society circumstances which prove the great and
important utility this admirable institution
there is no prescribed time for the objects this charity
to remain in the house it being varied according to
circumstances every effort is made use to find out their
relations and friends if possible to bring about a
reconciliation with them and if they prove to be persons 
character to put them under their protection if however
the young women are destitute such friends they are kept
in the house till an opportunity offers placing them in
reputable services or otherwise procuring them the means 
obtaining an honest livelihood and they never discharge anyone
without providing for her there have been but few
discharged beyond the age twenty years
the general business the establishment is conducted by a
committee consisting governors who meet at the
hospital every thursday at twelve o'clock precisely except
on the first thursday every mouth when they meet at
eleven two them attend at the chapel in rotation every
sunday at morning and evening service when a collection is
made at the door on entrance the hours divine service
are a quarter after eleven in the forenoon and a quarter
after six in the evening and on account the fascination
 the singing no place worship in the metropolis is
more worthy the notice strangers
an opportunity is afforded to companies who wish to visit
this charity by addressing a request by letter to the
committee any thursday or to a bonnet esq the treasurer
any day in the week and no fees are allowed to be taken
reformation wretched outcasts from society the principle on which
it is founded entitles it to the countenance and support the public
and particularly the female sex the object being to reclaim and
restore to virtue such wanderers in the labyrinths vice as are not
totally depraved
admirable intentions indeed cried tallyhoho if they are but as well
carried into effect
the records the establishment have proved its advantages to society
or rather i should say to its conductors for they are a nature
which cannot be publicly exposed without much private injury to
the individuals who partake them it is however not a little
remarkable that till lately on the very opposite side the road the
neighbourhood has exhibited scenes vice immorality and indecency
which it is the great object this charity if possible to prevent by
an endeavour to reclaim the miserable and deluded wretches from their
evil ways i remember the late john home tooke related in the house 
commons a curious anecdote in allusion to himself and his situation
at the time in which this institution was mentioned and which excited
considerable interest
it is well known that the late john home tooke political memory as
the reputed tutor a certain patriotic baronet the present day as
well as the author the diversions parley and a correspondent
 the yet undiscovered junius was a reverend divine the church
 england and when he became a member parliament it was objected
against him that no person in holy orders could hold a seat in the
honourable house commons in his reply he very ingeniously observed
that this objection reminded him an applicant for admission to the
magdalen who upon being exhorted by the chaplain to forsake her
evil ways replied that she was not aware his meaning and upon
explanation she was excluded from the charity because she was not bad
enough to require reforming this said mr home tooke is exactly
my case because i am in holy orders i must leave the house and
after committing some act impropriety to lose my gown i may yet be
eligible for a member this assembly
pointed enough said bob tallyhoho
yes replied tom and having mentioned the name the man you may
perhaps recollect the order the day as well as the curious
definition before the commissioners the income tax as to how a man
lives who has no income at all being interrogated by the commissioners
as to how he obtained his living mr home tooke replied as
follows why it appears to me gentlemen that there are three modes
by which a person may obtain a living the first is by begging now
this i am too proud to submit to the second by stealing this i don't
choose to resort to and the third is by the exercise the wits and
this gentlemen i presume you know nothing about
here said dashall is the surrey theatre formerly denominated the
royal circus i shall however dispatch my description it in a very
few words as we will ere long pay a visit to its interior it is a
neat building and shews a good front to the road is fitted up with a
considerable degree elegance and is a very convenient theatre it
was originally conducted by hughes and jones and its exhibitions were
both scenic and equestrian something in the style what ashley's
amphitheatre is now but you must see the one in order to form an idea
 the other horses are now banished at this place where under
an annual license from the magistrates the county burlettas
melodramas dancing and pantomimes are got up and performed in a style
which would not disgrace even the patent theatres it is at present
under the management mr dibdin a son the celebrated writer 
so many our national patriotic and characteristic ballads just
through the turnpike the building which gives a sort finish to the
road is the school for the indigent blind at the back which is the
philanthropic institution calculated to unite the purposes charity
with those industry and police to rescue from destruction the
offspring the vicious and criminal and bethlehem hospital for the
care and cure insane persons well deserving minute inspection
and to the right at the corner a road which leads from westminster
bridge towards vauxhall is an asylum for female orphans which as the
magdalen was intended to reclaim prostitutes was originally intended to
prevent prostitution to the left again is the king's bench and as
that is our present place destination we will forego any further
description till another opportunity
i cannot however refrain a few remarks on the situation we are
now in for from this place may be seen the children penance the
magdalen the children darkness the school for the indigent blind
the insane new bethlehem the infatuated and fanatic the congregations
 the soar chapel and the faithful menses garrets and wooden
tabernacles the children thespis and terpsichore the surrey
theatre mingled together as it were with the debtor and the captive
the king's bench at least placing ourselves at this obelisk in the
centre the road the mind's eye can comprehend them within a short
distance each other
and a curious admixture the useful and the sweet it certainly is
exclaimed tallyhoho anxious to give his cousin a little respite while
they turned to the left on their way to the bench
you will find continued tom all the beforementioned infirmities
blindness infatuation madness and profligacy within the walls that
we shall shortly enter without the repentant spirit the sisters
within the walls we have just passed you will also find there is
a plenty selfinterest and hypocrisy combined with them nay an
hospital incurables is only wanting to complete the scene it is not
till lately that a little reform has been effected in this quarter for
dover street and its vicinity as i before observed so near to these
benevolent charities and to the walls a prison have been the sink
 female profligacy the lowest most dangerous and most disgusting
kind and suffered too long to pollute the streams charity and impede
the road to reform however at length the nuisance is removed at least
the public appearance it though the neighbourhood is not altogether
bereft its private negociations and stolen accommodations but come
now for an interior view the abbott's park its interesting scenery
and its multivarious characters there you shall see what you shall
see and merrywell will tell you more in ten minutes than you might wish
to know in your whole life i mean practically though it is well to
know in theory what ought never to be reduced to experiment
chapter 
give me leave to ask a question
pray in the king's bench have you ever been
the bench good heaven how shocking a suggestion
was e'er so saucy a companion seen
well you ne'er saw the place or if you did
twere better not too closely to surmise
enough enough those frowns the thought forbid
who sees too much is rarely counted wise
i rather boast that mine are prudent eyes
persons and things so quietly they read
nor by a glance confess they scrutinize
that thoughtless lookers think me blind indeed
when themselves i take the strictest heed
but since you wish me to believe that college
ne'er gave its finish to your education
i its laws and customs having knowledge
ere i take up the thread my narration
must say a little for your information
they had now passed the outer gates the prison and entered a courtyard
surrounded by a wall which enclosed some good looking houses
these houses said dashall are occupied by the principal officers 
the place and devoted to purposes business or let out by them for
the accommodation those who have purchased the privilege the
rules this door directly opposite the gate is the only entrance to the
park
illustration paget king's bench
they next passed up the steps and entered a gloomy apartment whereafter
a few minutes a turnkey surveying their persons rather minutely
opened the ponderous door which admitted them to an inner court 
confined dimensions bob looked around him with surprise after the
description his cousin and began to think he had been vamping up
imaginary pictures what was not to be realized however hearing
a variety voices and perceiving another gate he quelled his
conjectures and followed dashall who upon knocking at the door
was surveyed from a sort loophole by the keeper within who quickly
gave them entrance and the spacious appearance the parade racquet
ground and habitations and a moving panorama personages both
sexes attracted his immediate attention
gazing with enquiring eyes upon this worldwithinwalls they
scarcely heeded the variety salutations with which they were greeted
on entering such as nods winks and touches on the shoulder from one
who appeared as unconscious such familiarity as if he had for sometime
been wholly absorbed in the solution a mathematical problem
or the horselaugh the ignorant and vulgar by whom they found
themselves surrounded struggling through the throng dashall impelled
his cousin forward repeating as he proceeded
how many o'er this threshold pass that mourn
wanting our power at pleasure to return
a moment let us pause ere we ascend
the gallery that leads us to our friend
survey the place where all that meets your view
is full interest and strangely new
could we but hide those grinning spikes awhile
borne spacious barrack we might think the pile
however continued he i perceive we are quizzed we will just take
a turn round and probably we may meet merrywell if not we will soon
find him out by enquiry you perceive they have the accommodation 
a butcher's shop and a baker's besides green stalls fish stalls
and chandlers shops which give the place the appearance a public
market while the racquet players and others amusing themselves in
various ways resemble that a fair
indeed said tallyhoho your description is just for i have as yet
seen but few sorrowful faces every one seems to have some object in
view either business or pleasure almost as attractive as those
without the walls
 and in many instances continued dashall as much nay more
interest however you perceive the
 the walls the king's bench are about thirty feet high
surmounted by a chevaux de frieze and as a place 
confinement it is great though uncertain antiquity
accommodation the inmates has been studied by the founders the
college water is well supplied from four pumps and were it not that
the walls intercept the views a man here might almost consider himself
in his own habitation with only one drawback
and what is that enquired tallyhoho
merely that like the starling he can't get out
how now said merry well who had espied the entrance his friends
from the window his apartment and immediately descended to greet
them touching the honourable tom dashall on the shoulder while he
seized bob by the opposite arm
what are you after exploring the secrets the prisonhouse
mutual congratulations having passed merrywell welcomed them to
his habitation significantly informing them at the same time that
notwithstanding his powers entertainment were just then not what he
could wish all was right the trick was done that he was arranging
for a house in the rules pro tempore and that it would not be long
before he should have the honour meeting them in a way that would be
more agreeable to all parties however continued he if you can bear
a confined apartment i promise you shall have nothing else to complain
 can you put up with potluck in a prison
certainly was the reply our object was to spend a convivial hour
with you to wile away a little the time to see and learn to take
a peep at things as they are and to form our judgments upon their
existence
then replied merrywell you have arrived en bon heure for in this
place a volume information may be obtained which if judiciously
applied must prove beneficial and while dinner is preparing i can
afford you abundance amusement so come along we must move round
this way to the gate again in order to take any thing like an accurate
survey and i can furnish some anecdotes the paraders the players
the officers the court and the visitors which cannot fail to prove
interesting this however must be done with caution for suspicion is
ever active and jealousy constantly awake within these walls and as
i mean to give you sketches individual characters rather than a
general view the society with which i am now in association a
little discretion may be well made use 
now let us analyse but not too loud
if wise the composition this crowd
made up from native soil and foreign clime
 waste and folly accident and crime
here join the speculator and the fool
greybeards and youngsters rather tit for school
at least for any school but this alone
where college vices in the shade are thrown
 pugilists haberdashers jugglers
horse jockeys swindlers bond street beaux and smugglers
by hollow friendship some in prison thrown
by others follies some more by their own
by this time they had traversed round the open walk the prison and
on arriving at the place entrance
do you observe that small building on the right it is called the state
house and contains the largest and most convenient rooms it is usually
devoted to the accommodation such as are best enabled to pay and
there are persons residing here who live as well and in as dashing
a style as those without the walls or at least pay as much for their
living on the left hand you may also perceive the chapel for the
spiritual wants those confined are not to be forgotten
there in the centre is the chapel door
with ever changing notices spread o'er
whatever doctrines may within be taught
with words peace that door is rarely fraught
for there mid notices beds for hire
 concerts in the statehouse by desire
some illspelt scrawl demands the mighty debt
 half a crown with a ferocious threat
some traitorous agent is denounced some spy
that blabb'd gin is hung in effigy
here angry fools proclaim the petty jar
and clumsy pasquinades provoke to war
by this time they had reached the door the chapel which by the
various placards pasted against it fully confirmed the description 
merrywell
bob casting his eyes around him discovered much for enquiry who are
those in the corner in close conversation together
the farthest from us replied merrywell is a jew attorney well
acquainted with all the shuffling arts the place one who can
explain the whole game from raising the wind down to the whitewashing
act for the knowledge and experience gentlemen or not so
as to obtain liberation by the whitewashing act no one at present can
tell and melville is taking his walks he is one the janitors and
crier the place he has a stentorian voice which is a part his
business to exercise in calling the prisoners i know but little him
and even that is not worth knowing he however has the character 
being an informer and i am not aware that he is in possession any
good qualities i shall therefore rather give a slight sketch the
office he holds than the person
whoe'er one night has slept within these walls
has heard the din that each new comer calls
to where the keeneyed turnkeys wait to trace
the lineaments every novel face
each morning thro the bench goes forth a cry
by melville sent thro every gallery high
to number one peals round the shout from ten
far rolling heard pull up now gentlemen
this is the custom with every new comer and is productive sometimes 
much mirth to some but infinite mortification to others according
to the circumstances the case as it would occupy some time to
describe them i shall give you a poetical sketch a morning in the
bench and by the introduction a fictitious name make you acquainted
with a general practice imagine for a moment
rous'd by the force that stentorian sound
rose belcour dressed and soon the lobby found
about the door a throng varlet stood
a grinning and illfavoured brotherhood
that scoff and gibe at every wight that wears
linen less black or better coat than theirs
for these young belcour was too fair a mark
make way cries one he's going to the park
his horses wait he's going for a ride
fool tis his tilbury another cried
d'ye think his lordship rides without his spurs
a curse upon such base unmanner'd curs
between his teeth impatient belcour mutter'd
as each his wit so truly attic utter'd
then mid the laughter the brutal throng
dark frowning through the door he moved along
within the upper lobby morris sate
and touch'd with easy complaisance his hat
and cried not deigning from his seat to stir
we hope you're pretty comfortable sir
these chaps about the door are rather rum
but love you so they do to all that come
short was the conference the turnkey's look
quick cognizance belcour's features took
and never from that hour might he pass by
unnoted by that wellobserving eye
well said tallyhoho i must confess such scrutiny on the one part and
such observations on the other would be more than likely to ruffle my
temper and i should be apt to signify my disapprobation at least 
all that was unnecessary
in that case replied merry well you would only subject yourself
to additional torment you would have songs epigrams lampoons and
epitaphs in abundance which would prove still more irritating for this
is the seat learning and wit poets painters and musicians
who being enraptured with their own arts neglect that bookkeeping
till a residence here gives them a leisure opportunity to close their
ledgers
 speaking on that subject by the by we have among us at this
moment the publishers the john bull whose combined efforts in the
way scurrility have rendered them notorious among the periodicals
 present times there is however little public attraction about
them and although they profess to have a subscription opened to enable
them to pay the fine imposed upon them it is doubted whether any
such is really in existence here however is a character another
description
captain k is still a gay fellow though i apprehend rather what we
call hard up just now he has had the opportunity expending a very
considerable property in seeing life but if report say true it has
been chiefly exhausted among the fair sex and coffeehouse keepers
seldom much depressed in spirits let the world wag as it will he
sometimes gives good dinners and enjoys himself with a friend though i
suspect that can under present circumstances only be done when he can
pitch the gammon to the wine merchant and induce him to stand the
nonsense
and do wine merchants give credit to persons in confinement enquired
bob
certainly was the reply for services done or promised to be done
or upon the security some friend who perhaps intends soon after to
pay his engagements by a similar mode to that the person whose debt
he pretends to secure no place can be found where the study ways and
means is more closely attended to than this our prisons in general
much the same may be said as our gaming houses very few get out 
them as they went in a dupe is the general character those who
first enter but they seldom fail to acquire that knave before their
departure the air is infectious the society fatal to morality and
to honesty few pass through the ordeal with purity and return
uncontaminated to the world and yet after all the frauds tricks and
speculations practised it is well to be acquainted with them in order
to guard against the recurrence if a man can but have fortitude enough
to avoid practising them himself
think not that the action the place
is all revealed upon this open space
the darkest portion the picture lies
obscur'd and cover'd up from public eyes
here much you see that bids you all mistrust
much that provokes aversion and disgust
new friends who coolly ask a one pound note
or borrow for an hour then pawn your coat
such stuff as this upon the surface swims
he little sees who but the surface skims
how much fraud and finished wickedness
how much deep despair and keen distress
thought by few and seen by none the while
is clambered in the niches this pile
zounds cried dashall your pictures have so much light and shade
so much to admire and so much to condemn that there is scarcely any
possibility arriving at any conclusion bless me there is dick
bakewell
do you know him said merry well
what the devil are you doing here cried a young man advancing and at
the same time catching the honourable tom dashall by the hand are
you initiated or merely come to take a peep at the curiosities this
menagerie have you tipp'd and shewn yourself in due form or do you
still sport a game leg among the gallants bond street
fortunately said dashall i can still boast the latter and have
no very strong inclination to aspire to all the honour and happiness 
the former
grown serious and sedate i suppose married and cant come pretty
wife lots children love and fireside comfort at home pleasure
abroad cash in hand and care for nobody that's the sort give you joy
with all my heart never were such times
i am glad you find them so continued tom but your anticipations
are a little too rapid and your imagination rather too vivid for my
proceeding however there is no knowing what we may come to life is a
labyrinth full turnings and windings but what brought you here
driven in by the philistines was the reply caught like a harmless
dove by the greeks clean'd out by the cog i was obliged to fly to
this pigeon house in order to avoid being cut up by my creditors and
up to a little the newmarket logic i am now crossing and rustling
though it is doubtful at present who will win the race
you have not far to run however replied dashall and it is
therefore fair to presume the heat will soon be over
 as usual cried rakewell always something short but pungent
like a pinch merrygoup satire and sentiment mirth morality
and good humour unmarried and still the same man these are better
subjects congratulation than the former
we shall dine at half past three said merry well and if you are
inclined to make one along with us you will find me at home
i should have no objection to meet you abroad exclaimed rakewell
but however i'm your man half past three d nd unfashionable but
never mind
i'll pick a bone with you and spite dull care and high walls
locks bolts and bars we'll defy you and my life for it we have
a jolly afternoon is the cellar well stored and the kitchen in good
repair
all right my boy exclaimed merrywell bring your bellows in
good order and don't be afraid your bread basket the dibs are
in tune a ball fires a dose daffy or a blow out black
strap will set the blue devils at defiance give a spur to harmony and
set the spirits a jogging
then at half past three i'll have a turn to with you continued
rakewell so no more at present from your loving cousin i am going now
to call on fred fearnought that fellow has deceived me i thought
him a trump but he's eaten up with hopes and fears tormented in mind
body and estate no more pluck than a dunghill chick i must stir him
up with a long pole give him a lesson or two touch him to the quick
and then quickly adjourn to you so adieu for the present
thus saying he made his escape from his friends and passing through
one the entrances to the interior was quickly out sight
that said dashall addressing his cousin was one the gayest 
the gay in all the leading circles haut ton 
and i assure you said merrywell he has not lost one atom his
vivacity notwithstanding the alteration in his circumstances he is
always full humour ready for a bit fun even in confinement he
plays laughs sings drinks and is about one the most cheerful
companions i know
 merrygoup snuff
 bellows a cant term for the lungs
 breadbasket the stomach
 the dibs are in tune there is plenty money
 a ball fire a glass brandy
then rejoined bob he is a philosopher for he has learned to bear
yes continued dashall but the other and by far the most important
part philosophy is to forbear
that said merry well he yet has to learn and i have my doubts
whether he will accomplish that desirable object while here he has
with a moderate allowance from his father contrived to drive his
fourinhand at times to keep seven or more horses on his hunting and
town establishments has kept some the most dashing and expensive
ladies expensive male company indulged in extravagant habits all
sorts and has twinkled for a while in the highest gambling circles
a run ill luck has at last sent him here but not before he had
honoured almost all the horsedealers coachmakers and saddlers
gunsmiths and tavernkeepers in town with his custom or rather with
his name on their books his father is a man considerable property
which must eventually come to him and he may yet form a conspicuous
figure in high life
what have we here said tallyhoho stopping to read a paper displayed in
the window a barber's shop
the old and only established shop at the prison
price shave well for one penny hair fashionably cut
for twopence at in first staircase round the corner
seventeen in sixteen i don't understand this
each the doors said merry well which lead to the apartments is
numbered as is likewise every room in each passage by which means
much facility is afforded to visitors who come to make a call upon their
friends the operator himself is a prisoner and so are most those
who carry on trades but opportunities are afforded for any person to
come in and supply articles to the inhabitants and at an early hour in
the morning you may hear almost all the cries london
milk matches eggs and epping sausages
greens watercresses chips geranium trees
a brush or broom deal wood cowheel and tripe
fresh butter oranges all round and ripe
rabbits a kettle jug or coffee pot
eels poultry homebak'd bread and rolls all hot
shirt buttons nosegays coals and god knows what
such are the goods that pass the lobby door
cried in all tones that vary squeak and roar
a little further on said merry well is the public kitchen wherefor
a trifling fee cooking is performed for the prisoners and hot
water supplied at a penny per kettle then there is a coffeeroom and
a taproom for general accommodation according to the circumstances 
the inmates so that in point fact there is little to be regretted
here but the loss liberty and the want money
zounds said bob those two articles constitute all that is valuable
in life and in their absence it dwindles into mere existence
and bare existence man to live ordained
wrings and oppresses with enormous weight
i admit the justice the remark for to become an article 
vegetation were it sure continuance would be one the most
irksome as well as degrading situations to which a man could be
reduced but you should recollect that the generality persons who
study in this college expect an early termination their privations
by which hope is kept alive and when the cherished hope is realized 
escaping from these walls all recollection the past is banished
and it is doubtful whether the temporary absence from the possibility
 indulging in folly does not increase the possibility as well as the
power when at liberty
who do you call that man with his hands in his pockets pointing to a
person at a short distance from them at the moment in slovenly attire
and with a vacant countenance
hush replied merry well for we have modest men here as well as
elsewhere men who though they have rendered themselves famous a more
delicate term than notorious are not emulous having their deeds
recorded in history and are indeed very tenacious satisfying
enquiries his name is f rr ter not quite so vacant as he looks for
it is generally speaking not your emptyheaded fellows who can arrive
at the honour a residence here it is rather those brilliant
imagination aspiring talent who have been determined to have money
for a time without heeding the source from which it was derived who
have been up to snuff till they have reduced themselves to the
necessity resting contented with the marrowbone stage instead a
phaeton or a curricle and twopenny in lieu claret the
person you allude to however is brother to cecil f rr ter court
notoriety and has really been in possession considerable property
it is said that his principal failing has been too strong an inclination
to resort to the law and that upon the law and lawyers he has expended
the bulk his fortune
he cuts a curious figure now however said tallyhoho and every view
at first sight would take him for a fortunate youth
do you observe that man in mustachios now talking with p s that
is captain r n who bears a more striking resemblance in character to
the celebrated youth you mention he had at one time inspired a belief
among those who knew him that he was a man property married with a
view to realize it and upon comparing notes after the nuptial knot
was tied both parties discovered they were taken in but it is not
ascertained whether this mutual disappointment ended with smiles
why it was no laughing matter said tom the lucky hit was all a
miss
yes there was a miss taken and a biter bit love is a lottery as well
as life and the chances two to one against the adventurer replied
dashall
it may be so said merrywell i am not fly to the subject
at present perhaps sparkle could by this time unravel some its
mysteries and give beneficial lessons to us all however time is
flying we will just make one more turn and then to dinner with what
appetite we may do you observe the pericranium topp'd with a prussian
cap and the wearer with a pipe in his mouth
 fit to be up to any thing to understand to know or be
awake
i was on the point enquiry said bob pray who is he
that is another captain
who one would almost think you have the whole army martyrs confined
here said tallyhoho at all events your ranks are not deficient 
officers
but then said dashall they are out commission and out 
practice
for want command continued merrywell though capt s 
although never made a commander in chief has been an exalted character
having once been made inspector the pavement or in other
words snapped the stoop and if report says true he has also figured
away in other situations equally honourable a flash turf man a naval
character and a smuggler but come i have given you a sort index by
which you may read mark and learn more when we are more at leisure
it is now half past three o'clock and punctuality is always my motto
 inspector the pavement or snapped the stoop cant term
for the pillory
humph ejaculated tom cash down and no grumbling
d n severity was the reply no more that or we cut touch my
honour and you touch my life
dot and go one cried dashall come along bob and catching his
cousin by the arm they followed merrywell in silence to his apartment
in the state house
on arrival they found the dinner on table and bakewell true to his
appointment arrived before them the keen air surrey though
rather confined had furnished them with good appetites apologies
were banished and to it they went without let hinderance or
molestation the viands were good the wines exquisite and plentiful
the cloth being removed mirth and conviviality were the order the
day
confusion to soft heads and hard hearts parks and pleasure ground s
without priories were drank in bumpers with enthusiastic applause the
merriment and hilarity merrywell and his fellow student crowned the
afternoon with as much pleasure and delight as bob conceived he
could have found under unlimited circumstances the good humour and
hospitality the host was manifested in the perfect satisfaction 
those he entertained and about eight o'clock when rakewell began to
mangle his mother tongue our friends after dropping their mites
into the canisters held out for their bounty repassed the gates well
pleased and highly diverted with the information they had obtained
and the occurrences the day and not a little exhilarated by the
bacchanalian juice
well said tallyhoho this is a scene real life which i should
judge could scarcely be equalled and would almost induce one to wish
for an opportunity a residence along with the collegians
 provided always nevertheless with an equal opportunity leaving
it when we please said dashall and probably we have only seen one
 the best pictures it contains for although we have been as jolly as
sandboys there is a large store misery unseen but let us proceed
we shall soon be free from college rules and a thought strikes me that
we can make a call on our road that will afford another view society
equally amusing and refreshing i have often observed to you that in
order to see life there is no necessity to bus about with court flies
to waste time and money in getting introduced to the tip tops the
west to join what are termed the fashionable circles and to a
fashionable career by a whereas or a whitewashing the true student 
real life should occasionally mingle with all descriptions persons
mark the characters and their conduct and believe me there are those
in the humblest situations who enjoy themselves in their own way with
as much heartfelt satisfaction as those in the highest which
i think i shall be able to give you a decided proof before we reach
home
they now pursued their way along the london road and over westminster
bridge till tom called a halt at the door a friend
come bob said he here we must unease doff the present toggery
and turn out in new trim for the evening
what enquired bob another masquerade
no no was the reply a temporary suspension the dress and
character a gentleman in order to avoid being tormented and
suspected by the company to which i intend to introduce you
finding his friend at home they were quickly supplied with tatter'd
garments and slouched hats in which they again sallied forth and about
nine o'clock they entered a low publichouse in scotlandyard
illustration pages public house
fear nothing said tom as they passed the threshold don't be
flurried by any thing said to you tis only a heavywet party among the
coalheaving coves
as bob entered the room his very first action betrayed him for being
accustomed to genteel behaviour he took off his hat which was in a
moment knocked out his hand by a hard featured fellow near him whose
face indicated the want water although so near the river
 order order was vociferated in an instant by a jolly
goodnatured looking man exalted above the rest who at the
same moment rapped the table with his knuckles this here way
gentlemen bill muggins mind you i ain't had your penny in the plate
for back
vy that's a lie roar'd out a stentorian voice i never takes my
seat before i sees my way clear upon the board i put a crooked ha
penny
yes and two bad gardens what an't worth nothing said another make
him tip cried a third or else stick him in the nitch
 stick him in the pitch send him to coventry
bob having regained his castor followed his cousin to the other 
 the room and after each depositing a penny in the plate they took
their seats at the table where being supplied with a flowing quart
they began to look around them
the first thing which struck tallyhoho's eye was no trust printed inlarge
letters at one the room a sort indication that a man
without money would not be likely to meet with agreeable entertainment
then turning his head the other way he discovered they were in a
house call for coal porters before the president who by way 
distinction had turned the broad flap his coalheaving hat forward
in the fashion a huntsman's cap was placed a small round table on
which stood a gallon measure heavy wet on his right sat a wornout
workman fast asleep and occasionally affording his friends around him a
snoring accompaniment to a roar laughter
silence silence vy don't you all be more quieter when i am going to
begin
order order chair chair now resounded from every one
well you know its no use at all for to make me take this here chair
because vy i an't got no voice
i knows better nor that said bill muggins for by wen you fell
overboard the other day you roared like a rum un and wen i pulled you
out you squeaked like a pig so that are proves what you have got two
voices and that's one more than you ought to have lord lord if you
had but seen him and i get drunk after it you would ha laughed dick
bolted blue ruin till his eyes sparkled just for all the world like a
wooden spoon against a soot bag
 a general laugh succeeded this sally which was accompanied by the
speaker with a violent blow upon the table which threatened confusion
to the candles glasses and porterpots with which it was loaded
veil continued the chairman you know its all my eye i an't got nosing
in me so if you're a mind to be friendly will you heave out
vy you know dick for the matter o that are i never refuses you
nothing nor what's more i never vont so here goes
what a hearty blade am i
care cant never touch my heart
every trouble i defy
while i views the foaming quart
a very good song and very well sung
jolly companions every one
clap your hats on keep your heads vain
a little more liquor will do us no harm
blankets and pins blankets and pins
when a man's married his sorrow begins
the six last lines were repeated as a chorus till every one appeared
to be exhausted and was succeeded by thunders approbation and
reiterated cries well done bill go it bill bill muggins forever
and the still unabated snoring their companion in the corner
bill muggins ant nothing but a goodman gemmensaid the president
here's his health landlord bring him a bolus blue ruin i say
bill what shall ve say after that are good song
here's bad luck and no blue ruin to bad masters and leg o mutton and
turnips for trumps that's all i got to say so here goes
the toast being drank
who is ve to call on now bill
vy bob martlet's the boy to come it strong
bob martlet was accordingly called upon but requested a few minutes to
prepare himself as he was rather hoarse
during this interregnum dashall slipped out the room and gave the
landlord an order to place two bowls punch on the tables cautioning
him at the same time to say nothing the party who paid for it but
to say that a gentleman passing by the door and hearing them all merry
had given an order for it at the bar
 upon reentering the room bob martlet with one eye bound up and
his hat in his hand was bawling with lungs leather
lovely nymph assuage my anguish
at thy feet a tender swain
prays you will not let him languish
one kind look would ease his pain
did you know the lad who courts you
he not long need sue in vain
prince song and dance you
scarce will meet his like again
as this was a song to be sung in character bob martlet determined to
profit by the instructions shakspeare to suit the action to the
word and the word to the action and consequently at the word dance
he introduced some steps to the great entertainment the company
but unfortunately jigging to another tune in which all the broad brims
joined he forgot the connexion the words and was compelled to sing
it over again and to give his hornpipe by way conclusion which was
accompanied by the barking a dog
tallyhoho laughed heartily at this the grotesque appearance the
tender swain and the dance in wooden shoes were admirable and
highly relished by his companions the room resounded with applause
and it was some moments before silence could be obtained when lo and
behold the landlord entered the room as a peacebreaker with two bowls
 punch
consternation and surprise were visible in every countenance the
confusion tongues could scarcely equal the enquiries made in a
moment but the landlord having his cue made no reply but there
it is will you drink it it is all your own and to set you a good
example here goes success to trade and took a hearty swig from the
bowl he placed before the president then taking the other bowl to the
lower the room he evaporated but soon returned with
glasses where he came from or how it was obtained was banished from
consideration and to make more the remnant a pot heavy wet was
thrown into the bowl to mellow it as the president observed because
vy he liked things mellow the punch was handed about the song and the
toast passed merrily in succession till near twelve when an unlucky
disturber harmony with a candle set fire to the whisker hill
the flue maker so called from his having in his younger days been
a chimneysweeper hill who had slept during the noise the evening
was notwithstanding his former trade not fireproof awoke in a flame
and not knowing the real depredator upset the president and nearly
knock'd him through a window just behind him milled away in all
directions growling with as much melody as he had before snored during
the confusion this affray tom and bob took their departure from
charley's crib which they understood was a nickname given to the place
and throwing themselves into a rattler soon arrived in piccadilly
where we shall for the present leave them to their repose
chapter v
since life's but a jest let us follow the rule
there's nothing so pleasant as playing the fool
in town we may practise as well as at school
the world turns about the same things o'er and o'er
we fool it our forefathers fool'd it before
they did what we do which our sons will encore
life's but a half holiday lent us to stare
we wander and wonder in vanity's fair
all babylike bawling for each bawble there
we children like covet the glitter gay things
make racket for ribbands and such sort playthings
which we cannot have tho without we can say things
we take or are in all our turns taken in
the world to be sure tis a shame and a sin
might soon be much better but who will begin
 london said the hon tom dashall to his cousin abounds with
so much munificence that notwithstanding all its intricacies and
inconveniences he who travels through life without visiting it may
justly be said to know nothing for it is all life its remotest corners
are full animation and although it is difficult to fancy how all
live there are few but could give some satisfactory information if they
chose though i am willing to believe many would rather wish to avoid
interrogation we have already explored some parts it but be assured
there is still much to admire much to applaud and much to deprecate
our researches after all have been rather confined than extensive it
is such an ever varying and never ceasing mine observation that it
is almost like the wishing cap fortunatus with this exception that
although every wish may be supplied it requires something more than
putting on the cap to obtain the object desired
 from what i have already seen replied tallyhoho i perfectly
coincide with you in the latter part your observation for i have no
doubt but perseverance and integrity with some portion ability is
sure to meet reward
you are right continued tom many instances could be pointed out
in proof the justice that remark some the greatest men the
present day have rose from the lowest origin shopboys and porters have
become tradesmen and merchants shoeblacks have become statesmen and
servants councillors but on the other hand many who have been born as
the old saying is with a silver spoon in their mouths have fallen
from their high estates and lingered out the latter parts their
lives in prisons or workhouses laying the blame on fate rather than
attributing failure to their own want ability prudence or active
exertion but come i perceive the curricle is ready let us take
a spank through the city and look a little more minutely at the
mercantile world
this call was instantly obeyed by tallyhoho who never doubted but
his cousin had some object in view though he frequently started from
piccadilly without being previously acquainted with it
passing out at hyde park corner bon remarked that he thought the city
lay the other way
never mind replied dashall we shall come to the point without
doubt why man there are more ways than one and i am not particularly
partial to being blocked up in the public streets amidst knowing
surveys and cramp carmen sugar hogsheads molasses and slush carts
which is so frequently the case when by a slight deviation from the
direct way we can give the tits a rattler on a good road without
obstruction and pocket a handful time into the bargain
he now turned into the road which leads directly to vauxhall bridge on
arriving at which tallyhoho was much delighted with an extensive view 
the thames
this said dashall will bring us to a favourite place amusement
where you have already cut a conspicuous figure
what do you mean enquired his cousin
a masquerade replied he significantly go along bob
 passing gently over the bridge do you observe continued he
that extensive building that is called the penitentiary it is a
building designed for the punishment employment and reformation 
offenders secondary turpitude usually punished by transportation
for a term years it has been conceived since the commencement the
disputes which terminated in the separation the american states
the plan it is known to be partly that mr jeremy bentham the
culprits are confined in circular buildings the windows which are so
constructed that the overseer from his room in the centre may be able
to view every one their rooms the external wall encloses no less
than eighteen acres ground within which are six these circular
buildings each capable lodging and employing from to 
prisoners with a chapel infirmary and other conveniences its
situation is called millbank
it looks said bob like a castle or tower impregnable
strength
it is however continued tom a useful institution since it
supersedes that indiscriminate transportation so long practised and
which as applied to definite periods was cruel and unjust since the
wretched objects were precluded from the power ever returning
to their native land however short the intended period their
banishment this part the world is much improved late years the
bridge we are now passing is an admirable light and elegant structure
but recently erected according to the plan mr j walker and
connects as you perceive by a straight line road with hyde park
corner the road before us leads to lexington cross and thence by
various ways to the city the bridge consists nine arches equal
span in squares cast iron on piers rusticated stone formed 
fragments united by means parker's cement its width is feet
the span the arches feet the height feet and the clear
breadth the road way is feet it cost above l but we
shall shortly cross another bridge far surpassing it in point 
magnificence
it is wonderful indeed said bob that in a country complaining 
a starving population such serious sums money should be expended in
the erection splendid mansions and magnificent bridges
 not at all was the reply for perhaps it is one the
best ways expending as it gives employment to thousands who would
otherwise have become beggars on private charity or paupers on public
bounty either which is revolting to the mind an englishman
besides if your observation applied at all it would cut at every
improvement the day and you should recollect that whether upon
true foundations or not every generation think the age they live in is
the most enlightened so it may be with respect to the preceding and
indeed so much so that the succeeding will rather decline than improve
upon it but it would be difficult to convince them the fact it is
certain however that scarcely a day passes but some new invention or
improvement is offered to public notice the perusal the newspapers
is an evidence my assertion and as london is the centre 
attraction so it is the seat knowledge science and information
i should judge that if a person who had lived some two hundred years
ago even in this wild place were to rise up amongst us his surprise
and astonishment would be strongly excited said bob endeavouring to
draw forth more his observations as they bowled along the road
there can be no question on that subject said tom for how would the
high ideas he entertained the ingenuity the age in which he had
lived dwindle into nothing nay should he appear in the country
first what would he think the various implements husbandry for
ploughing and preparing the land the different machines for sowing
the corn for threshing grinding and dressing it and in numerous
instances though perhaps not quite so much now as it has been on
account the present agricultural distresses he would find something
else too which he might not consider an improvement instead meeting
the honest homely farmer assisting personally in the gathering in his
crops and his daughter following the cart with a rake he would find
the former mounted on his pray following the hounds and the latter at
boarding school instead the farmer's son bringing home his cows 
an evening and his sister going out to meet him at the sound his
well known voice with her milkwhite pail he would find the one poring
over latin and greek and the other running her fingers over the chords
 a harp or pianoforte
 these said bob are refinements in manners at least
then should he take a peep at london as we are now doing he would be
struck dumb with admiration but here we are on the waterloo road that
building on the right is the coburg theatre so named in compliment
to the prince saxe coburg who married the unfortunate princess
charlotte wales the much regretted daughter our present king
before us is waterloo bridge which leads to the strand and was
originally denominated the strand bridge it is acknowledged to be
one the most majestic structures the kind perhaps in the known
world and was built under the direction the late mr jennie to
whose memory it is said a monument is intended to be erected the bridge
consists nine equal arches and like the bridges the ancients
is perfectly flat which you perceive the road we are now travelling is
not for in some instances you may look over the wall upon another world
below as we are above the tops the houses its being level is a
circumstance highly favourable to the draught carriages across it
and without any apparent subtraction from its beauty we will alight
here and walk leisurely across taking time for remark
the servants now took charge the curricle with orders to wait at the
corner the strand while our heroes having each deposited his penny
at the tollhouse strolled forward
tallyhoho appeared delighted with the views around him in the front a
fine prospect one the finest cities in the world and behind an
equally pleasing sight over the surrey hills the day being fine
and the sun darting his refulgent beams on the bosom the thames
contributed to form altogether one the most enraptured sights he
had ever beheld the passing and repassing boats and barges
below and carriages horsemen and pedestrians crossing the bridge
alternately attracted his attention
each arch this bridge said dashall is feet span the piers
 feet thick with tuscan columns the width between the parapets 
feet these footpaths are seven feet each and the roadway is 
feet the cost has been immense and it is not likely that the original
subscribers will ever realize the capital expended
 at this moment the sound music attracted the ears tallyhoho
what have we here said he thrusting his head through the
balustrades by which he found himself almost suffocated with smoke
which stopped further enquiry
behold said tom another improvement the age that is the
richmond steam boat proceeding with a cargo live stock to that
celebrated place public resort and in spite wind and weather
will return in the evening they always have a band music on board
for the amusement their passengers
zounds said bob they ought to have a smokeconsumer
they had one just now replied tom for i apprehend you assisted them
in some degree though not voluntarily
you are smoking me said bob
never mind you have only been puffing a cloud
however as the mist is dispelled said tallyhoho and we have a clear
sky before us again let us make use our senses
to the right you perceive blacksmiths bridge and beyond that the
southwark bridge by the way we were speaking the alterations to be
witnessed in a country life we will now pursue the subject and suppose
for a moment our twothousandyearsago friend after his visit among
the swains inclined to transfer his observations to the great town the
first question would be how shall i get there oh there are plenty 
night coaches and day coaches too sir well then fancy him seated ina
night coach and having supped on the road on resuming his corner
 the vehicle he falls into a sound sleep guess what must be his
surprise on waking in the morning to find himself in the bustle and
apparent confusion the streets the metropolis but how altered
wide streets and upright houses instead narrow lanes with houses
meeting each other at the tops then what elegant shops he would
exclaim rubbing his eyes why this is all a dream
proceeding from the heatoppressed brain
 it cannot be reality however he swallows a hasty breakfast
and sallies out again to look about him from london bridge he espies
the one i have just mentioned the southwark bridge what have we
here oh sir that is the castiron bridge with three arches
over the thames he hastens to it and when upon it what must be his
astonishment at the power the human mind to form and the human
body to bring together such immense pieces iron to connect queen
street cheapside with the kent and surrey roads by three arches the
centre which is feet span and the side ones feet each the
arches all composed cast iron the piers and abutments stone
zounds he would exclaim if the race man dwindle in stature they
grow daily more stupendous in intellect but we will suppose like
you with an anxiety to see all that can be seen he perceives a machine
sailing down the river with astonishing velocity why formerly said
he wind and tide against a vessel were insurmountable obstacles in its
passage but now they seem to add to its swiftness how is this to be
accounted for easily enough replies a byestander lord
bless you it's all done by steam hot water and smoke do every thing
nowadays why there are a great number machines which formerly
required from two to forty or more horses each to put and keep in
motion entirely worked by the steam arising from boiling water 
prodigious steam do all that astonishing
and truly replied bob notwithstanding i have witnessed many
improvements i confess i am astonished at the various uses to which
this discovery has already been devoted and the extraordinary powers it
possesses
well we will pursue the train thought a little further suppose
perambulating the streets till he is quite tired and seeing alterations
and changes out number he enters a coffee house eats a hearty meal
and taking a glass or two wine he falls into a musing train ideas
 the wonders he has been witnessing from which he is not disturbed
till the hoarse voice a charley sounds in his ear past ten o'clock
and a cloudy night at which he hastily starts up discharges his bill
and prepares by buttoning up close and securing his trusty stick for
as he would naturally expect a dull dreary walk he sallies out thus
equipped and to his utter astonishment finds the streets as busy as
in the middle the day and almost as light he steps up to one the
lights to examine it what can this be it is not oil there is
no vessel to contain it surely this can't be steam also but what can
it be gas sir says a passenger who overhears the question gas
it is produced from coals set on fire and confined in a furnace the
subtle vapour from which is conveyed by means pipes and light
applied to it immediately bursts into a flame his astonishment would
now be complete and if he did sleep after it would be difficult to
persuade him it was not all a dream
our wise forefathers knew the worth land
and banked the thames out with laborious hand
from fresh encroachments bound it's restless tide
within a spacious channel deep and wide
with equal pains revers'd their grandsons make
on the same spot a little inland lake
where browsing sheep or grazing cattle fed
the wondrous waters new dominion spread
where rows houses stood through many a street
now rows ships present a little fleet
nay we had made had nature not refus'd
had father thames not begg'd to be excus'd
a pretty tunnel underneath his bed
and left him running grumbling over head
had scratch'd a track out like a grubbing mole
through a long dark and damp and dirty hole
like rats in sewers had floundered through the mud
instead sailing ducklike o'er the flood
but bubbling springs choked up the project deep
and trickling waters on our folly weep
by this time they had crossed the bridge and having regained the
curricle the hon tom dashall tickled the tits in prime style along
the strand in the road to the city soon after passing temple bar they
were attracted by a vast concourse persons surrounding the shop 
mr carlile from whence upon enquiry they learnt the
 perhaps some the most remarkable occurrences in the
city london have taken place at the house carlisle the
whole family have been tried and convicted selling
treasonable or seditious works and are now suffering the
sentence the law but notwithstanding the combined
efforts a powerful body the shop is kept open and it is
more than likely that a greater business is carried on now
than ever in a recent number the republican published
by him he makes the following observations
since my last went to press we have thought it prudent to
resort to stratagem to defeat the schemes the gang intaking
out every new hand from the shop by a warrant we
now sell all publications to suspicious and unsuspicious
customers through a hole in a part the shop where it is
impossible for the purchaser to identify the seller as
there are always two or three serving in the back ground
none whom can be seen or heard to be identified
individually these persons are frequently changed so that
even if the enemy resorted to burglary and housebreaking
upon the strength any warrant the seller any pamphlet
or pamphlets could not be identified where the statue 
paine stood we are about to caricature the defeat murray
and sharpe and make them watch the hole through which the
money and pamphlets pass without being able to prevent it
there are fifty stratagems by which i could give full effect
to the sale my publications as well as if they were
sold openly and which would defy prosecution as the vender
could not be identified i dislike this mode doing
business i like open fair play and i now considerable taste by which
the interior the church has been much improved in appearance
after having examined these stately and expressive mementos 
mortality the two visitors were asked by their attendant whether they
would pass to the stone and iron galleries outside the church but
this having so lately enjoyed the extensive prospect from the monument
they declined and proceeded at once to the library the first object to
be seen in the ascent
our two visitors were very much pleased with this handsome room which
in its dimensions is about fifty feet by forty having shelves books
to the top with a gallery
 the statues dr johnson and howard the philanthropist
both executed by the late mr bacon were opened for public
inspection in that dr johnson represents a moral
philosopher with the attitude and expression intense
thought leaning against a column indicative the
firmness mind and stability principles the man whom
it is intended to commemorate
the statue howard in which the character active
benevolence is well expressed stands upon a pedestal 
white marble on which is a group basrelief
representing a scene in a prison where the philanthropist
having broken the chains the prisoners is bringing
provision and clothing for their relief
the statue sir william jones a man well known for his
extensive and multifarious erudition whose study it was to
make the british name honoured and revered amongst the
nations the east is also the work bacon and was
erected by the east india company
amongst the monuments lately raised in commemoration departed
worth is that nelson and in design and execution
it is not exceeded by any in the cathedral
in the open part the cathedral the stranger will be
struck with the appearance numerous tattered flags the
trophies british valour those over the aisle leading
from the western door were taken in part during the
american war and the rest by the duke york at
valenciennes those on both sides near the north door were
reprisals made from the french by lord howe on the st 
june opposite to which on the right hand are the
flags taken from the spaniards by lord nelson in and
on the left are those taken from the dutch by lord duncan
at camperdown and by lord keith at the cape good hope
running along the sides the floor is oak consisting 
small square pieces and is not only curious for its being inlaid
without a nail or a peg to fasten the parts but is very neat in the
workmanship and beautiful in its appearance the principal things
pointed out to a stranger are several carved stone pillars some latin
manuscripts written by monks years ago and an english manuscript
illuminated containing rules for the government a convent written
in old english about years since all in fine preservation
the clockwork and the great bell were the next curiosities that
attracted the attention our visitants on the latter weighing
lbs the hammer the clock strikes the hours it was now noon
and the ponderous hammer put itself into motion and slowly yet with
astounding impetus struck the bell and the reverberation tingled on
the auricular organs the two strangers with painful and stunning
effect throughout the long protracted intimation the hour nor was it
until a considerable time had elapsed that their hearing recovered from
the clanging agitation
 this bell is never tolled but upon the death some 
the royal family the bishop london or the dean 
st paul's and then the clapper is moved and not the bell
in the stillness night the indication the hour by the
deeply sonorous tone this bell may be heard not merely
over the immense metropolis but in distant parts the
country the fact is well known the sentry at windsor
who when accused having been asleep one night on his
post denied the charge saying that he had been listening
to st paul's in london which had just struck thirteen
and this assertion was upon enquiry satisfactorily
corroborated
they were now ushered into the whispering gallery which is
constructed on the very simple principle an unbroken communication
it is yards in circumference and a stone seat runs round the
gallery along the foot the wall on the side directly opposite to the
entrance door dashall and his friend seated themselves when the person
who shewed the gallery whispered close to the door at the distance
 feet and yet they heard his voice seemingly at their ear the
shutting the door resembled a clap thunder from this gallery
round the inner circle which is an iron balustrade the marble
pavement the church exhibits a beautiful appearance and the
paintings the dome which have greatly suffered by time are
thence seen to the greatest advantage
the ascent to the ball is attended by some difficulty and is
not encountered by many our two visitants therefore declined its
inspection the interior diameter the ball is six feet two inches
and will contain twelve persons
 a new ball and cross have lately replaced the former 
similar dimensions the erection the scaffolding and
subsequent proceedings the workmen at so fearful a
height from the haunts men excited a very general
interest more particularly so on the recent happy
accomplishment the undertaking when the intrepid
aeronauts cheered the admiring multitude far beneath and
seated in the clouds like the deities mount olympus
drank to the prosperity their friends in the nether
regions
the best view the metropolis is obtained in a clear day from the
gallery at the foot the lantern the diminutive appearance the
passengers and other objects beneath is extremely amusing and resembles
the elfin panorama the capital lilliput
the calm serenity the interior the awful grandeur the structure
itself and the reflections arising from the contemplation monuments
erected to the memory departed worth with the splendid achievements
 heroic minds formed a strange contrast to the scene which presented
itself to their view on leaving this magnificent pile the hurry
bustle and confusion the street the noisy vociferations 
coachmen carmen c burst upon their senses at a moment when the mind
had been soothed by reflection and the eye gratified with a sight which
led imagination into futurity before which the past and the present
had appeared to evaporate the hon tom dashall however was quickly
recalled by observing his curricle so completely hemmed in between
contending parties to obtain liberation at the corner paul's chain
as to afford but little chance escape from its intricate situation
for some time
zounds said tom we had better return and take a seat among the
worthies within for i have no idea mounting the curricle to sit and
be quizzed
any chance said bob is better than that but at all events your man
is able to take care the carriage and cattle and we are competent to
the care ourselves
well hinted replied tom and it shall be acted upon
 thus saying he made his way through the throng and gave orders
for the curricle to proceed home as soon as it could be extricated from
its present confinement then returning to his cousin
it is not the first time i have been disappointed i had made up
my mind to proceed much farther but the very scenes we have been
inspecting are proofs the inability man to perform all his wishes
although equally a proof the splendid talents and deter she is matronly
appearance and was well dressed the mobility received her with due
respect the lady made her obeisance and the assemblage retired on
terms apparently reciprocal satisfaction
strolling onwards until they gained the centre blacksmiths bridge
the two friends paused in admiration the interesting scene before
them
amidst the spires and turrets the metropolis saint paul's close
at hand rose in the proud preeminence stupendous grandeur like a
mighty monarch surrounded by tributary kings rendering him the
homage vassalage
emerging from the dense mass buildings on the line from the tower
to westminster abbey appeared a continued succession prominent
public edifices on the river thames the scene was diversified by
numerous wherries gliding pleasurably on the rippling wave some
shooting under the arches the elegant waterloo and others under the
spacious span the lofty iron bridge southwark while on either
side the river labour was on the alert and the busy and ceaseless hum
 industry resounded far and near
twas low water and the mudlarks now intent on their several
vocations engaged the eye the squire what are those people
about he asked what are they in search 
these are mudlarks answered his friend in search what chance
may throw in their way all's fish that comes to net you have much
to learn yet real life in london and must prolong your stay
accordingly willing to eat the bread honesty these poor people
are in the daily practice frequenting the shores the thames to
literally pick up a living nothing comes amiss all that is portable
however insignificant in value goes into the general repository
the mudlark returns home when his labours are ended sorts the
indiscriminate heterogeneous mass matter and disposes it as
well as he can
 how many hundreds and thousands in a metropolis like that
 the british empire obtain a subsistence in a way 
which those its inhabitants who are not compelled to such
an exercise their ingenuity can have no idea in the
midst a crowded city man is much more closely cut off
from all assistance on the part his fellows and is
obliged to trust entirely for the support life to the
individual exertions his strength his talents or his
ingenuity various and singular are the expedients practised
by numbers in the british capital among these the class 
mudlarks is not the least extraordinary that is people
who on the ebb the tide repair to the riverside inquest
 any article that the water may have left behind in
the mud to this description people belonged peggy jones
the well known mudlark at black friars she was a woman
apparently about forty years age with red hair the
particular object whose researches was the coals which
accidentally fell from the sides the lighters her
constant resort was the neighbourhood blacksmiths where
she was always to be seen even before the tide was down
wading into the water nearly up to the middle and scraping
together from the bottom the coals which she felt with her
feet numbers passengers who have passed by that quarter
particularly over blacksmiths bridge have often stopped to
contemplate with astonishment a female engaged in an
occupation apparently so painful and disagreeable she
appeared dressed in very short ragged petticoats without
shoes or stockings and with a kind apron made some
strong substance that folded like a bag all round her in
which she collected whatever she was so fortunate as to
find in these strange habiliments and her legs encrusted
with mud she traversed the streets this metropolis
sometimes she was industrious enough to pick up three and
at others even four loads a day and as they consisted
entirely what are termed round coals she was never at a
loss for customers whom she charged at the rate eighteen
a load in the collection her sable treasure she
was frequently assisted by the coalheavers who when she
happened to approach the lighters would as if
unfeignedly kick overboard a large coal at the same time
bidding her with apparent surliness go about her business
peggy jones was not exempt from a failing to which most
individuals the lower orders are subject namely
inebriety her propensity to liquor was sometimes indulged
to such a degree that she would tumble about the streets
with her load to the no small amusement mischievous
boys and others who on such occasions never failed to
collect around her after concluding the labors the day
she retired to a wretched lodging in chick lane this woman
carried on her extraordinary calling for many years but
about the month february she suddenly disappeared
from her usual places resort and nobody can tell what is
become her a man who has the appearance a coalheaver
has since stepped into her place and adopted the
profession which she so long followed
 thus it is that the mudlark earns a precarious and scanty
subsistence and in many other instances in this metropolis ingenuity
and perseverance overcome difficulties that in the country would prove
insurmountable
retracing their steps to ludgatehill the associates passed into the
old bailey where the squire seemed struck with surprise at the simple
bill fare an eatinghouse not inscribed on paper and exhibited
against the window but deeply engraved on brass and conspicuously
fixed by the side the door expressed in four syllables only the
boil'dbeef house compendious enough exclaimed his cousin multum
in pavo rejoined the squire and immediately walking in they
were ushered into a snug room partly occupied by guests apparent
respectability each actively employed in the demolition buttock or
flank with great seeming satisfaction the two strangers intimating a
desire to follow so laudable an example the waiter submissively put the
question which would you please to have gentlemen buttock or flank
or a plate both that the quality each might be ascertained
plates both were ordered and presently brought in piping hot and
in the first style culinary perfection
 it was amusing to observe the characteristic features the
different guests
the young man hurrying over his meal and frequently casting a look on
the dial indicated a tradesman's bookkeeper desirous enjoying his
pipe and pint ere the allotted dinner hour expired when he must return
to his desk
another meagre and cadaverous appearance had his plate replenished
thrice repeated and each time dispatched the contents with astonishing
celerity this man without doubt was either a poet or a bookseller's
hack who probably had not for sometime enjoyed the novelty a
dinner and was thus making atonement to appetite accordingly
one gentleman fashionably attired kept mincing his meat and at long
intervals supplying estimates that seemed not at all alert in the
performance their office his attention was given rather to the
company than to his plate and was particularly directed to dashall
and tallyhoho on whom it alternately settled with fixed and favourite
regard this very polite personage was assiduously eager by every
possible courtesy to ingratiate himself into the notice our two
friends but dashall was a knowing fish so the bait wouldn't take
and the squire happening to ejaculate the word younger the stranger
prudently took the hint and withdrew
 thirty years ago this house was noted for the excellent
quality its boiled beef no other meat is ever drest
here hobson's choice or none during that period it has
had several occupants and each has retired with a very
considerable fortune in the decided superiority its
buttock and flank the house still sustains its pristine
reputation
 these gentry are hardly to be distinguished from the
hangeron except by being if possible more impudent they
frequent all places public resort in order to pick up a
dinner or a bottle and otherwise prey upon the credulity 
the unwary whenever they meet with a countryman they
salute him with enquiring the time day or describing the
weather and entertaining him with a story little
consequence till they have artfully wheedled you into an
invitation to dine or sup with you they can tell you where
the best entertainment is to be met with which is the best
comedian can get you introduced to see such an actress to
hear this sing or that spout will provide you with the best
seat at the playhouse or keep a place for you in the front
row the first gallery should you prefer it to the pit
can procure a ticket for the exhibition rooms for half
price and explain every thing in the museum as well as the
librarians themselves if your inclination is for mischief
he is the only man in the world to assist you would you
break the lamps or mill the charleys he will stand by and
cry bravo till you are carried to the watchhouse but will
not engage in the quarrel himself acting only as a corps
de reserve when you are taken he will negotiate with the
constable the night about your ransom for which you must
pay smartly otherwise be detained till justice opens her
doors to descry and punish your enormities according to the
nature the crime committed upon which the younger says
that he foresaw and told you the consequences that would
happen if you persevered but that you would not listen to
his advice
 having done satisfactory justice to the buttock and flank and
further refreshed themselves with a draught whitehead's entire
our pedestrians leaving the boil'd beef house recommenced their
excursion by proceeding up the old bailey when dashall remarking on the
number eating houses with which that street abounds observed that
it seemed a favorite seat consolidation for the professors the
culinary art like clothfair for woollendrapers paternosterrow for
booksellers and clerkenwell for watchmakers c this said dashall
is his majesty's gaol newgate and from this door ascend the
numerous victims to the fatal scaffold in immolation to the offended
laws their country let us enter this temporary abode crime
and wretchedness it has been much meliorated by the humane and
indefatigable attentions an excellent lady mrs elizabeth fry and
i am desirous seeing the result her philanthropic exertions the
gentlemanly appearance and demeanour the two strangers facilitated
their admission and they entered the prison preceded by one the
turnkeys who courteously had proffered his services in shewing the
place and giving every required information
newgate on the eastern side the old bailey has been rebuilt its
walls or shell excepted since it was destroyed by the rioters in the
year a broad yard divides newgate from the sessions house a very
handsome stone and brick building another edifice where that lately
stood commonly called surgeon's hall has been erected it is arched
underneath and supported upon pillars and is used as a place 
accommodation for witnesses and other persons while waiting for the
trials during session time
 this prison until within these few years back was a place 
confinement as well for debtors as felons but by late arrangements
and the erection the new gaol in whitecrossstreet newgate has now
become the receptacle felons only
 newgate has been the scene two remarkable events which
frequently serve as eras reckoning to some the
inhabitants london the first is that the memorable
riots in when this imposing edifice was attacked by a
furious mob in the evening monday the th june who by
breaking the windows batterking the entrances the cells
with sledge hammers and pickaxes and climbing the walls
with ladders found means to enter mr german's house
communicating with the prison and eventually liberated
three hundred prisoners the next these events occursed
on the rd february this was when haggard and
holloway were to suffer for the murder mr steele on
hourslow heath the populace began to assemble so early as
five o'clock and to accumulate until eight it is supposed
that the concourse people was greater than at the
execution governor wall at eight o'clock the prisoners
ascended the scaffold immediately after they were launched
off a most dreadful scene took place the approaches to the
place were completely blocked up with carts filled with
spectators and when some the crowd began to move away
the pressure became dreadful some fell and others falling
over them they were trampled to death terror took
possession the crowd they became desperate and their
efforts only contributed to increase their danger as soon
as this frightful confusion ceased fortytwo sufferers in
the scene were carried to st bartholomew's hospital 
these twentyseven were dead and though every effort was
made for their resuscitation in not one instance was it
crowned with success fortytwo the whole number five
were women and three them were among the dead the
remaining twentyfour bodies five were men and the rest
lads from twelve to seventeen years age among the dead
men was a pyeman who was said to have fallen first and
caused the dreadful catastrophe a great number the
pupils in attendance happened to be collected in st
bartholomew's hospital at the time and afforded prompt
assistance and dr powell and a surgeon who were both
upon the spot directed their humane exertions
in the old bailey stood sydneyhouse known by the white front and the
recess in which it is concealed and here jonathan wild is said to have
lived the greatest part his time the north side newgate consists
 two courtyards which are far too circumscribed for the numerous
inhabitants this prison always exhibiting a multitudinous calendar 
human depravity the men's court is only feet inches by feet 
and the women's the same length and about half the width the whole
square is entirely surrounded by the wards which rise three
stories above the pavement the women's yard is separated from the
men's by a wall in the south and southeast yards felons for trial are
confined and four other yards are similarly occupied the yard assigned
to female felons is a wretched place containing three wards in which
are sometimes kept upwards one hundred women in the northeast
corner next newgatestreet is the condemned yard in which are
kept persons under sentence death the yards and all the wards are
repeatedly limewashed and by these and other excellent regulations
 the sheriffs london newgate is changed from a loathsome prison
dangerous to the health the metropolis to a state which maybe
quoted as a model for all similar places water is plentiful
ventilators are introduced into every window and a general system 
cleanliness prevails throughout the whole prison the morals its
inmates have been improved and their condition greatly meliorated
by mrs elizabeth fry who like her predecessor in the exercise 
philanthropy the celebrated howard delights in reducing the sum
 human misery the feelings the two visitors having been
amply gratified by demonstration the happy result from superior
management accruing to the prisoners they departed not forgetting
the poor box put up for general benefit inviting the contributions 
charitable strangers
continuing their route our perambulators proceeded down skinner street
into lowborn and traversed its extended line without any remarkable
occurrence until they reached broad street st giles's we are now
said dashall in the holy land
long life to your honors exclaimed a ragged professor mendicity
give a poor fellow the price a shake down and may you never be
without the comforts an upright 
what mean you asked the squire by a shake down and an upright
not the worse luck that you don't know that self same thing now but
sure enough a shakedown is a twopenny layer straw and saving the
tatters on my back not a covering at all at all may the son my
father never have a worse birth any how
and an upright
 is it an upright your honor's speaking about fait and troth as
to that same may the devil fly away with thady o'flannagan and that is
myself sure if he knows much about it at all at all seeing as how he
has not rested his old bones on such a thing array these many long
years but sure enough it is four stumps with boards across a good
flockbed a blanket below and a sheet above with a decent coverlet
pieced and patched in a hundred places to boot may you never want the
like it any how
thanks for your good wishes my friend said dashall and this for
the information which you have given us
by the powers good luck exclaimed the itinerant philosopher a
tirteener now an irishman's blessing upon you for two goodhearted
gentlemen may you live all the days your lives in peace and
prosperity both here and hereafter
 the many impoverished and deserted beings who daily wander
the streets trusting for the vegetative existence the
moment to eleemosynary occurrences are incalculable
amongst these sons and daughters misery happy is the one
who after partially satisfying the cravings hunger
possesses twopence the price a shake down for the
night in bainbridge or beveridgestreet st giles's the
upright is a wretched semblance a bed at the rate 
threepence or fourpence but the lofty aspirant to genteel
accommodation must put down a tester in this way there are
frequently beds to the number seventy in one house made
up for nocturnal visitants
palestine in london or the holy land includes that portion the
parish st giles bloomsbury inhabited by the lower irish with whom
it seems a favorite place residence the squire having expressed to
his friend a desire perambulating these boundaries they proceeded
by the way george street to explore the sanctified labyrinths the
scenes diurnal clamour and hebdomadary conflict
arrah now exclaimed a voice maternity in the person a
legitimate daughter erin arrah now you brat the devil's own
begetting be after bowling along to your fader bad luck to him and be
sure that you bring him home wit you by the token that the murphies are
cracking the saltherrings scalding and the appledumplings tumbling
about the pot d'ye mind me you ties the world tell him that his
dinner waits upon him i'll be after doing that same modern
and forth from the ground floor a mean looking house in
beveridgestreet sprang an urchin without hat shoe or stocking and
the scanty tattered habiliment he wore fluttering in various
hues like pennants in the wind with such heedless velocity urged no
doubt by the anticipated delicacies the dinnerpot that he came in
furious unexpected and irresistible contact with squire tallyhoho who
borne forward by the shock was precipitated into a stagnant collection
 mud and water to the total disfigurement his boots which had
that morning received the matchlessly brilliant polish warren's
inestimable jet blacking not like many others in london who will
run you down and leave you to your fate the heir his fader's
whimsicalities stopped short in the inauspicious setout his rapid
career and dirty he exclaimed to the scavenger that didn't
think the gentleman's boots and at the same time the mother this
hopeful representative the mac dermott family made her appearance
with the genuine warmth irish hospitality and inviting the two
strangers to walk in consoled the bespattered squire with the prospect
 speedy and effectual reparation for fait and troth said she his
dinner is all a heap in the pot there parties saltherrings and
appledumplings and that is my husband thady mac dermott who is
neither more nor less than a bricklayer's laborer is after amusing
himself and obliging his neighbours at a small outlay a sunday
morning by cleaning their boots and shoes so it is an ill wind that
blows nobody good they say the accommodating hostess then producing
a bottle blacking with the requisite brushing implements applied
herself assiduously to the operation cleaning the squire's boots
and restored them in a few minutes to the splendour their pristine
brilliancy
scarcely had this important operation been performed when entered thady
mac dermott and his son the origin the accident the devil burn
your trampers you imp the mac dermotts cried the father couldn't
you run against the gentleman without dirtying his boots never mind it
at all at all i'll be after giving you a walloping for it any how
 the fastidious delicacy english cookery when
contrasted with that irish culinary preparation in the
holyland is surprising the wife an irish laborer who
is desirous giving her husband a delectable meal and 
various description borders not her brain with a diversity
 utensils but from the same pot or pan will produce as
if by enchantment potatoes without which an irishman
cannot possibly make a dinner saltherrings and appledumplings
nor does this extraordinary union opposites
affect the appetite those partaking the olio
 the first instrument attack that comes to hand is an
irishman's weapon thady brandished in terrorem a red hot poker and
his son with the agility a cat took sanctuary under the bed but at
the intercession the squire was allowed to emerge with impunity and
admitted to a participation the saltherrings and appledumplings
the two friends declining an invitation to taste these dainties
now departed tallyhoho not forgetting the outlay and the illwind that
blows nobody good
winding the mazes the holy land which may not unaptly be considered
a colony irish emigrants our perambulators without further
occurrence worthy notice threaded their way through streets lanes
and alleys until they emerged at the bottom tottenhamcourt road
close by the extensive brewery read and co entering the premises
they were gratified with a view every thing interesting in the
establishment and the squire to whom the spectacle was entirely new
stood wrapt in wonder at the vast magnitude its immense vats
and boilers containing as he observed the fluid sir john
barleycorn a sufficiency to inundate the whole neighbourhood such a
circumstance said the attendant actually occurred a few years
ago when the vat burst and an ocean beer rushed forth with such
impetuous force as to bear down in its resistless progress the side 
a house and fill to the imminent hazard drowning the astonished and
alarmed occupants all the cellars in the vicinity
 scarcely into quick circulation harmony and
hilarity prevailed and the poet availing himself the moments 
inspiration gave the following chant extempore 
song

this complimentary bagappelle was well received and sir felix
shaking the amateur cordially by the hand observed that amongst other
attainments before he left london he meant to acquire the art making
verses when he should give the poet a rowland for his oliver
the player having but recently returned to town after completing his
engagements with some the irish provincial theatres proceeded to
amuse his auditory the baronet excepted with accounts the manner 
posting in the sister kingdom
travelling said he in the province munster having got into a
chaise i was surprised to hear the driver knocking at each side the
carriage what are you doing an't i nailing your honor why do
you nail me up i don't wish to be nailed up augh would your honor
have the doors fly off the hinges when we came to the the
stage i begged the man to unfasten the doors ogh what would i betaking
out the nails for to be racking the doors how shall i get
out then can't your honor get out the window like any other
gentleman i then began the operation but having forced my head
and shoulders out could get no farther and called again to the
postillion augh did any one ever see any one get out a clay head
foremost can't your honor put out your feet first like a christian
here the baronet manifested considerable impatience and was about
to interrupt the narrator when the latter requesting permission
continued
next day four horses were attached to the crazy vehicle one
unfortunately lost a shoe and as i refused to go on until the
poor animal was shod my two postillions commenced in my hearing a
colloquy paddy where will i get a shoe and no smith nigh
hand why don't you see yon gentleman's horse in the field can't you
go and unshoe him true for ye said jem but that horse's shoe
will never fit him augh you can but try it said paddy so the
gentleman's horse was actually unshod and his shoe put upon the posting
hack and fit or not fit paddy went off with it
 same day during a violent storm wind and rain found that
two the windows were broken and two could not by force or art 
man be pulled up i ventured to complain to paddy the inconvenience
i suffered from the storm pelting in my face his consolation was
augh god bless your honour and can't you get out and set behind the
carriage and you'll not get a drop at all i'll engage
the player having thus closed his narrative and the laughter the
company having subsided the baronet very candidly admitted that the
sister kingdom in many parts was miserably deficient in the requisites
 travelling and other conveniences to which the english were
accustomed but in process time he continued we shall get more
civilized nevertheless we have still an advantage over you we have
more hospitality and more honesty nay by the powers but it is so my
good friends however much we unhappily may quarrel with each other we
respect the stranger who comes to sojourn amongst us and long would he
reside even in the province munster before a dirty spalpeen would
rob him his great coat and umbrella and be after doing that same
thing when he was at a friend's house too from which they were taken
along with nearly all the great coats cloaks shawls pelisses hats
and umbrellas belonging to the company
 we are inclined to believe that sir felix alludes to the
following instance daring depredation
extraordinary robbery on thursday night whilst a large party young
folks were assembled at the house mr gregory in hertford street
fitzroy square to supper a young man was let in by a servant who said
he had brought a cloak for his young mistress as the night was cold
the servant left him in the hall and went up stairs when shortly
after a second arrived with a hackney coach and on his being
questioned by the servant he said he brought the coach to take his
master and mistress home the servant was not acquainted with the names
 half the company and therefore credited what was told her the two
strangers were suffered to stand at the stairs head to listen to the
music and singing with which they appeared highly delighted and
also had their supper and plenty to drink but while festive hilarity
prevailed above the villains began to exercise their calling below and
the supper table in a trice they unloaded four silver table spoons
a silver sauceboat knives and forks c and from off the pegs and
banisters they stole eight topcoats several cloaks shawls pelisses
and hats besides a number umbrellas muffs tippets and other
articles all which they carried off in the coach which was in
waiting to complete the farce the watchman shut the coach door and
wished their honours good night the robbery was not discovered until
the company was breaking up no trace the thieves can be found
 there was certainly somewhat an irishism in the baronet's
remark eight great coats stolen the thieves could not discriminate
who were the respective owners and if it had been possible that they
could have discriminated it is not likely that any regard for the laws
 hospitality would have induced them to make an exception sir felix
o'o'grady's property amidst the general depredation
the company although secretly amused by the baronet's remarks condoled
with him on the loss he had sustained and the player protesting that
in stating the facts irish posting he had no intention giving the
baronet the least offence unanimity was restored and the conviviality
 the evening proceeded without further interruption
sir felix made irish bulls anding to the jolly deity the ancients in frequent and powerful
libations
by some unaccountable means the daemon discord however gained
admission and ascendancy
a scene now took place which baffles every attempt at description the
row became general decanters glasses and other fragile missiles
were resorted to their fragments strewed the floor and the terrified
attendants hastened to require the interposition the guardians the
night in restoring order and tranquillity
amidst the ravage and dissonance war our trio preserved a strict
neutrality and before the arrival the mediating powers had regained
their position in the piazzas where they waited the result the
conflict
negotiations peace having been unavailingly attempted the refractory
combatants were taken into custody after an obstinate resistance and
conducted to duress vile in the watchhouse
 the tragicomedy was decently wound up by one the performers
a native the emerald isle who thinking it necessary that the
neighbourhood should have an intimation the proceedings announced
the hour past three with the accompaniment a bloody
morning
the neutrals now proceeded to their respective homes and our two
associates reached their domicile without the occurrence further
incident
next morning the indicative double rittat the postman induced the
squire from the breakfastparlor to the hall the servant had opened
the door and received the letters when an itinerant dealer in genuine
articles obtruded himself on the threshold and doffing his castor after
the manner a knowing one enquired whether his honor was pleased to
be spoke with tallyhoho desired him to step in and required to know
his business the fellow with a significant wink and many prelusive
apologies for the liberty he was about to take stated that he had
accidentally come into possession some contraband goods chiefly
hollands geneva and india silk handkerchiefs prime and
indisputable excellence which he could part with at unparalleled low
prices that he had already in this private way disposed the
greatest portion and that if his honor was inclined to become
a purchaser he now had the opportunity blending economy with
superlative excellence in an almost incredible degree and unequalled
in any part the three kingdoms
this flourish the squire answered with becoming indignity expressed his
surprise at the consummate assurance any trickster who would dare
to offer him a contraband article to the prejudice his majesty's
revenue and ordered the servant to turn the scoundrel out 
doors
 the above mentioned fracas took place a few weeks ago
the offenders against the peace our sovereign lord the
king were next day held before one the police
magistrates when it appearing that the row occurred under
the influence ebriety and that the landlord and the
watchmen were the only sufferers a compromise was
permitted and the parties were discharged with a suitable
admonition
 contraband articles the squire apparently was not
aware that the superlatively excellent hollands geneva and
indiahandkerchiefs were the one the manufacture 
spitalfields and the other the sophisticated balderdash
known by the name maidstone gin it is a fact altho not
generally known that at the different watering places every
season the venders silk handkerchiefs manufactured in
spitalfields carry on a lucrative trade by disposing 
them under the affectation secrecy as the genuine
produce the indian loom and thus accommodating
themselves to the prejudice their customers against our
native productions get off in threefold proportion the
number sold in london and at a cent per cent greater
advantage
with respect to alleged contraband spirits the deceit is
more successfully manoeuvred in town than in the country
the facility smuggling on the coast frequently supplies
the maritime visitant with a cheap and genuine beverage in
town the same opportunity does not occur and on the
uninitiated in the cheats london the system this
species imposition is more frequently practised
professing to exhibit real life in london we shall not
trouble our readers with an apology for the introduction 
the following appropriate incident
court ok requests lowborn a case rather a curious
nature and which was characterised rather by the absurd
credulity the parties than by its novelty came before
the commissioners on thursday last a man the name 
o'regan attended the court to show cause against a summons
which had been issued calling upon him to pay a debt 
eighteen shillings which was alleged to be due by him to a
person who stated his name to be higgins the parties were
both irishmen and exhibited a good deal irritation as
well as confusion in their stories with some difficulty
the following facts were collected from their respective
statements on tuesday week about nine o'clock in the
evening a man dressed in the costume a sailor and
wearing a large rough coat similar to that commonly worn by
seafaring men in bad weather entered the shop o'regan
who is a dealer in salt fish and other haberdashery as he
called it in st giles's and beckoning to the back part 
the room and at the same time looking very significantly
said may be you would not like a drop the real thing
to keep a merry christmas with what do you mane says
o'regan whiskey to be sure says the man faith and
it's i that would replied o'regan provided it was good
and chape och by the piper bulrush says the man
there has not been a note cleaner more completer drop 
putshean whiskey illicitly distilled smuggled across
the herringbrook the irish channel for many a long
day and as for shapeless you shall have it for an ould
song you don't mane to say it's after being smuggled
says o'regan be my soul but i do rejoined the manit's
i and jack corcoran a friend mine brought it safe
and sound into the thames last sunday in the shape a
cargo butterfirkins from cork could a body taste
itpursued o'regan with a couple why not says the
man i've a blather full it under my other his armpit
if you'll lind us hould a glass o'regan said he
hadn't a glass handy but he brought a cup and the bladder
being produced a fair taste was poured forth which
o'regan having tippled it off after collecting his breath
swore was the darling a drop it was the next kin to
aquafortis aqua fifties you mane says the man
aquafortis is a fool to it the next question was as to
the priceoch by the powers says the honest smuggler
as you're a countryman and friend you shall have it for
ten shillings a gallon and less than that i wouldn't give
it to my mother o'regan thought this too much and
proposed eight shillings a gallon but after much
chartering he agreed to give nine shillings the quantity
was next discussed the man could not sell less than an
anger four gallons this was too much for o'regan but he
finally determined to get a friend to go partners and
higgins who lodged in his house was called down and also
indulged with a taste which he likewise pronounced
beautiful it was then arranged with strong injunctions
 secrecy that the tub should be brought the next night
in a halfbushel sack as if it were coals and the hour 
nine was appointed thor the
day to their request
 have you breakfasted asked dashall whether or not answered
sir felix i'll take a cup taa with you any how
when the repast was finished the triumvirate set out on their
pedestrian excursion interrupted however in their progress by a
temporary shower they took refuge in a coffeehouse where sir felix
taking up a newspaper read from amongst the numerous advertisements
the following selected article information convenient
accommodations for ladies who are desirous privately lying in
and their infants carefully put out to nurse well now after all
observed the baronet this same london is a very convenient place
where a lady may gratify her pleasurable propensities and at same time
preserve an unblemished reputation it is only going into the country
sure for the benefit her health that is to say she retires to one
 the villages in the neighbourhood london pays her way without
name given or questions asked and in a few months returns to town
improved in health but more slender in person all her acquaintance
exclaiming la my dear how vastly thin you have grown
there are in london and its neighbourhood said dashall numerous
such convenient asylums but i cannot acquiesce in their utility i
am rather opinion that they have a demoralizing tendency as
accelerating by concealment the progress licentiousness human
failings will still predominate and the indulgence illicit
intercourse is less frequently prevented by an innate principle
 virtue than the dread shame when facility concealment is
therefore given to the result these connexions will still become more
prevalent
by the powers exclaimed sir felix but i think morality ought to
feel particularly benefited by these convenient asylums they preserve
reputation and in some instances have prevented suicide and murder i
know two cases wherein both crimes were perpetrated through a sense
 shame and dread discovery which probably would not have
happened could the unfortunates have resorted to convenient
accommodations well here's good luck to the fair sex the dear
creatures and may they every one them die on a christmas day any
how
 this eccentric wish elicited a look surprise from the squire
which sir felix observing
my reason is said he that the gates heaven being open all that
day long a body may slip in unknown as it is to be hoped that you
mr dashall and i may do some day shortly without any interruption at
all at all
this ludicrous finis excited the laughter the company
but lo the clouds break off and sideways run
out from his shelter lively looks the sun
and the united observers real life hailing the favorable presage
resumed their perambulation
advancing along piccadilly towards hyde park they reached the splendid
mansion the hero waterloo the gates were open and a travelling
carriage with four horses was in waiting for his grace who was then
about setting off to inspect the fortifications the netherlands
neither sir felix nor tallyhoho having ever seen the duke the triumvirate
paused at the entrance the courtyard until the carriage came forth
when they saluted the gallant warrior with the tribute respect due
to distinguished services and exalted genius which his grace very
courteously returned
 on the subject convenient accommodation for ladies
who wish privately to ly in if we might hazard an opinion
it would be in coincidence with that our friend dashall
these establishments are certainly an encouragement to
licentiousness and it is well known that in many these
receptacles where the strictest honor and secrecy may be
relied on the allurement abortion is held out to the
unhappy female if she declines the anticipation maternal
solicitude
 thirtytwo great personages anecdote the duke 
wellington his grace the duke wellington when last in
the netherlands and travelling without attendants in a
part the country where his multitudinous titles were not
well understood was overtaken on the road by a veteran
officer whose route lay in the same direction with that 
his grace the duke having occasion to stop and as the
officer would reach a certain town several hours before him
he requested that the veteran would take the trouble 
ordering dinner for him at the principal inn the old
officer made his conger and proneeded on his mission i
am desired to order dinner here said he to the landlord
but stay i had better state who for then calling for
pen and ink he presented the astonished and delighted host
with the following list his forthcoming illustrious
guests
the prince waterloo
the duke wellington the duke ciudad rodrigo
and the duke victoria
the marquis douro and a marshal general france
master general the ordnance
colonel the royal rest horse guards blue
colonel the rifle brigade
the lord lieutenant hampshire and
the governor plymouth
field marshal austria

prussia

england and
the netherlands
a grandee the highest class
a captain general spain

the garter in england st andrew in russia the black
eagle in russia charles iii in spain st ferdinand and
merit in spain the golden fleece in spain maximilian
joseph in bavaria st maria theresa in austria the
sword in spain st esprit in france st george in
russia the tower and sword in portugal
and to bring up the rear
a doctor civil laws
mon dieu exclaimed the host in extacy what a noble
company he then began to tell them over one prince
he continued three dukes one marquis a marshal general
 france an english governor an english lord lieutenant
the master general the ordnance and two english
colonels six field marshals one grandee the highest
class a captain general spain twelve knights and a
doctor civil laws mon dieu thirtytwo great
personages
all the provisions the town all the delicacies the
season and all the celebrated wines were immediately put in
requisition for the illustrious company in expectancy
at last the duke wellington arrived and was ushered into
a spacious diningroom where a cloth was laid with thirtytwo
covers the person the duke was unknown to the
innkeeper who full important preparations for the
thirtytwo great personages thought not any thing
else i ordered dinner here said his grace mon
dieu responded the innkeeper are you one the thirtytwo
great personages presenting the list at same time his
grace glanced his eye over it they are all here said
he so send up the dinner immediately the innkeeper
stood aghast with amazement at last finding utterance he
ventured to express a hope that his grace would be pleased
to take into consideration that he the innkeeper had at
great trouble and expence provided a most sumptuous
entertainment for thirtytwo great personages d n
the thirtytwo great personages exclaimed the duke send
up the dinner and your bill thus i must pay the penalty
said he for not having invited the old veteran to be 
the party
 the squire observed that the brilliant victories his grace
although acknowledged and rewarded by all the potentates europe had
not procured him much popularity at home the remark was confessed by
dashall to be correct but whence the public indifference originated he
could not presume to explain
crossing hyde park which a celebrated physician denominated the lungs
 the metropolis our pedestrians made their egress into oxfordroad
this fine street with longitudinal reference the first in london
excited the admiration the baronet the long line perspective
indeterminable to the view stretching from hyde park corner to st
giles's the general uniformity the buildings the neatness and in
many instances the splendor the tradesmen's shops together with the
comfortable manner their perambulation jostled and unimpeded by
the hurry throng and bustle passengers with which many other
parts the town are annoyed gave an additional zest enjoyment to
the trio in their excursion while the squire observed that he felt in
this part the town always as if he had been suddenly removed to
some other region the world far remote from the city london its
dissonant uproar and crowded inconveniences
turning into blenheim street dashall apprized his companions that if
they felt inclined to take a peep into the theatre anatomy he could
procure their admission
the squire seemed to recoil from so disgusting an exhibition while
on the other hand the baronet expressed a great desire to enter the
theatre i have been used to murder and mutilation said he
the devil you have ejaculated the squire where how
where else should it be but in ireland replied the baronet and as
to the how was it not sure after the manner my profession while i
was a member a corps yeoman cavalry during the rebellion when we
whipped hanged beheaded and mutilated men every day by dozens so
you may guess my good friend that cutting up a human carcase
is nothing new to me only now i should like to see if there is any
difference in the mangling human bodies by the anatomical artists
 london from the cidevant military professors the loyal troop 
doneraile
the hesitation manifested by the squire yielded ultimately to the
importunity the baronet and they entered the human shambles where
the cutters up were at work upon a subject securing to themselves the
advantage personal experience in the process dissection the
abdomen had been already cleared out and the corpse was portioned out
to the different students anatomy for the purpose illustration
the arms to one class the legs to another the head to a third c so
that in less than a quarter an hour decapitation and dismemberment
were completely effected and the trunk was deserted as an
uninteresting object from which there could not be derived any
information importance further than that which the students had
already obtained
sir felix whispered his friends that these adepts in human mutilation
far exceeded in apathy feeling and adroitness execution even the
cidevant loyal troop doneraile but when one the young artists
brought forward in his hands smeared with gore a human heart for the
operation the dissecting knife tallyhoho declaring that he could bear
it no longer rushed out the theatre and was followed by his two
companions all disgusted with this spoliation the dead however
conducive it might prove to the interests the living
 the human subjects for these theatres anatomy and
private dissection are chiefly supplied by
resurrectionists a class depraved wretches whose only
employment is that bodysnatching or robbing the graves
 their dead from which they derive a ready and lucrative
emolument the anatomists are ready at all hours to receive
without questions asked and with prompt remuneration the
produce these unsanctified depredations dreadful must
be the feelings the fond relatives a departed friend
to learn that the sanctuary the grave has been violated
and the body perhaps a beloved wife sister or other
revered female exposed to the gaze and subjected to the
scalpingknife these butchers
iron coffins have been resorted to as a safeguard which
once closed cannot be opened for this improvement the
artist obtained a patent but he is not likely to derive
much advantage from his invention as the parish officers
within the bills mortality have generally refused the
rites sepulture to bodies cased in iron alleging that
the almost imperishable material would shortly compel an
enlargement burying ground at a vast expence which it
is the duty the parish officers to prevent by resisting
the interment bodies in iron coffins and this resolution
has lately had the sanction legal authority

proceeding along oxford street sir felix enquired for the holy land 
informing his friends at same time that his servant whom he had
entrusted the preceding day with a cheque on his banker had not been
at home all night and the probability was that he had got amongst
his munster friends in palestine sir felix was therefore desirous 
ascertaining if possible the sanctuary the fugitive and with
that view requested his friends to accompany him in a perambulation 
discovery through to him these hitherto unexplored regions this
application was readily assented to and the triumvirate passed onwards
to the place destination
they had now reached the church st giles in the fields situated in
broad street st giles's and their attention was immediately directed
to that fine piece sculpture over the iron gateway leading into
the churchyard representing the resurrection and last judgment the
figures are in basso relievo and although diminutive are admirably
grouped and the expression each gives to the whole a finished and
impressive effect
two minutes more and the three friends were on the boundaries the
holy land namely george street or as formerly cognomen dyott
street bloomsbury
at the this street next to st giles's were several the
lower irish both gender who clustering together seemed to hold
a close confabulation casting occasionally an inquisitive eye on sir
felix o'o'grady
by the soul the priest at last exclaimed one the munster
pedigrees but it is him and i would take my davy on it but sure
enough i will ax the gentleman himself now whether he knows who he is
or if he is any body at all at all
this real representative the tagrag and bobtail the emerald
isle was arrayed in the appropriate costume his class and country
a nameless something that had once been a hat covered a shock head 
hair the redundancy which protuberant sideways and perpendicularly
from the cidevant castor in many a knotty combination
impervious to wind and weather the fragments a loose great coat
decorated his tall athletic form which scarcely reaching his knees
exposed fully to observation his nether habiliment
his galligaskins that had long withstood
the winter's fury and encroaching frost
by time subdued what will not time subdue
now horrid rents disclosed portending agues
his brawny legs were partially cased in worsted hose the dilapidation
 wear and tear ingeniously repaired with cloth pieced and patched
and comprising all the prismatic colours the rainbow his toes
disdaining the trammels duress peeped through his brogues as if
anxious for freedom and to complete the singularity this strange
figure his vacant face was incrusted with filth his bristly beard
unshorn
and stuck in his mouth capacious dimensions
that never to similar shape had prate
captivates
we are on a shopping expedition replied one the ladies you
and your friend melvillehall are observers life in london
generally ours is a mere circumscribed sphere action we go to
view life in a mercer's shop when the squire and you are not more
pleasantly engaged give us a call and perhaps we may grant you the
honor an interview we would ask the unknown said she in a
whisper who is he
 a thief from habit not long since there existed in
the fashionable world a female rank and property who
was an habitual expert and incorrigible thief she would
frequently sally forth in her carriage and alighting at the
doors perhaps half a dozen different tradesmen rummage
over their goods without makking a purchase and embrace
the opportunity purloining any portable article that lay
in her way those tradesmen to whom her thieving
propensities were known used to watch carefully her
manoeuvres let her walk off with the spoil and then send a
bill depredation which she uniformly and without
hesitation discharged this unfortunate woman was one
morning detected in the shop a mercer to whom she was a
stranger in the act pilfering some article value he
was about to detain her when she burst into an agony 
tears acknowledged and lamented deeply the irresistible
infatuation under which she acted disclosed her rank and
family and the compassionate mercer suffered her to depart
at another time being one a cardparty a gold snuffbox
vanished from the table every person present denied any
knowledge it madam you are mistaken said one the
company you have got the snuffbox in your pocket how
very absent i amexclaimed our heroine producing the
box and i beg that you will continue absent said the
lady the mansion
 sir felix o'o'grady madam answered dashall an irish baronet
 recent acquaintance like every other gentleman the emerald isle
combining with characteristic eccentricity a sound head and a warm
heart
then all things bring him with you so waving gracefully her
hand adieu the trio responded by respectfully raising their hats
allons donc she exclaimed and the carriage drove off
there go exclaimed dashall two the most lovely and accomplished
women in london and perhaps the least tinctured with fashionable
folly
with the exception observed the squire shopping that is i
presume making the morning tour tradesmen's shops tumbling over
their goods giving them every possible trouble and ultimately making
no purchase
dashall admitted the correctness the squire's observation as
generally applicable but claimed an exemption for the ladies in
question
on the left proceeding down chancery lane dashall pointed to a
respectable house as the occasional residence a lady in the first
class literature whose writings have given universal satisfaction
and will continue to be read with increased avidity as conveying the
most admirable lessons morality told in a manner alike impressive
and pathetic mrs ope the widow the late celebrated artist this
excellent woman is endeared to the circle her numerous acquaintance
by a preeminent
 tallyhoho had improved in his knowledge real life in
london his definition shopping was perfectly correct
one those fashionable female idlers who delight in
occupying the time and exercising the patience the
industrious alighted a short time since at the shop a
tradesman in ludgatestreet and after a couple hours
spent in examining and reexamining a variety rich silks
made her election at last and desired the mercer to cut her
off a shilling's worth throwing at the same time the
money on the counter the tradesman with perfect coolness
took up the piece coin laid it on a corner the silk
circumscribed it with his scissors and presented the part
so cut out to the lady as the shilling's worth required we
feel pleasure in recording the result the lady admired the
mercer's equanimity temper laughed heartily at his
manner illustrating it and in atonement for trouble
given and patience exemplified became and still continues
one his most valued customers
 suavity disposition blended with superior mental endowments
to the unfortunate by her benevolent heart to which the appeal 
distress is never made in vain and to the public generally by her
invaluable works the uniform tendency which is the advancement 
virtue and the inculcation the benign feelings humanity
 to the admirers mrs ope the following lines never
before published will not prove unacceptable
tribute respect
o thou matchless power to raise
and bend the passions to thy sway i
whose pen with magic force portrays
whose spell the shadowy forms obey
 joy and grief hope and fear
and wiles from apathy a tear
enchantress take the duteous lays
to worth that admiration pays
to thee as to thy ope given
on immortality a claim
his virtues pass'd from earth to heaven
yet still exist in deathless fame
his pencil to thy pen assign'd
to charm instruct and grace mankind
and oh could but my humble strains
to thy impressive skill aspire
the muse that faintly now sustains
thy worth would make poetic fire
and glowing high with fervid name
would graft her honors on thy name
but ah bereft every stay
from hope exil'd with woe i keep
my vigils each sad sorrowing day
and wake each dreary night to weep
by penury chill'd poetic powers
no voice to soothe no hand to save
and snatch a victim from the grave
around me desolation lours
and glaring midst the deep'ning gloom
despair and famine urge me to the tomb
if all unmeet my humble strain
is destin'd still to flow in vain
shouldst thou the tribute now refuse
essayed by misery and the muse
reject not yet the lay with scorn
to thee by kindred feelings borne
for still thy tales plaintive tone
breathe pain and sufferings like mine own
 facing the entrance to the royal wax works sir felix made a full
stop that fellow said he alluding to the whole length figure 
the sentinel stands as motionless as a statue by the powers but
halfadozen peepoday boys in his rear would be after putting life and
mettle in his heels shoulder and carry your arms you spalpeen and
is this the way that you show the position a soldier at same time
enforcing his admonition with a smart stroke his cane over the arm
 the inanimate military representative the attendant a young man
in the costume the yeomen the guards remonstrated dashall and
tallyhoho laughed most immoderately and the baronet equally enjoying the
joke persisted in affecting to believe that he was addressing himself
to a living object greatly to the amusement the now congregating
street passengers
begging your pardon ray jewel continued sir felix long life and
good luck to you in your stationary quarters and may his majesty never
find a more active enemy than yourself by the soul my grandmother
it would be well for poor ireland who has taken leave her senses if
her bogtrotting marauders were as peaceably inclined as you are fait
and troth but you're a fine looking lad after all and with the
assistance your master and a touch prometheus we might raise
a regiment braver fellows than the king's guards without bounty or
beat drum in the twinkling an eye honey but with your leave
and saving yourself unnecessary trouble we'll be after paying a visit
to the company above stairs and the party proceeded to the exhibition
room
here were representatives the living and mementos the dead kings
and queens princes and princesses
ah cease the sad resemblance here
thee then to every feeling dear
 tender sympathy thy way
illumin'd to life's remotest day
in bliss in worth in talent shine
though pain and want succoured mine
adorning this terrestrial sphere
be long an ope's talents given
and virtue consecrate the tear

a k
 warriors statesmen poets and philosophers in social
communion not forgetting the lady who had three hundred and sixtyfive
children at a birth
the baronet made many confess to the great and inferior personages by
whom he was surrounded admired the heterogeneity the group and
regretted that their imperfect creation precluded the possibility 
converse
one the figures by an unobserved excitement the attendant
now inclined its head to sir felix who nothing daunted immediately
assumed the attitude macbeth in the banquet scene and exclaimed
nay if thou canst nod speak too if our graves and charnel houses
give those we bury back our monuments shall be the maws kites
the company present pronounced the baronet a player and a lady to whom
the manly and athletic form the supposed tragedian had given apparent
pleasure assured him she had never heard the passage more impressively
delivered and that certainly in the character the scottish usurper
there was no doubt his becoming to mr ran a very formidable rival
sir felix sustained his part admirably expressing his high
acknowledgment the lady's favorable opinion but the enquiry when and
in which theatre he meant to make his first appearance had so nearly
deranged his gravity and that his two friends as to induce them to
hasten their retreat
dashall and tallyhoho congratulated the baronet on his promising dramatic
talent and advised him still further to court the favors the tragic
muse
may the devil burn the tragic muse he exclaimed
 thus runs the legend
a lady in former times who it seems like some our
modern visionaries was an enemy to superabundant
population and would have restricted the procreation 
children to those only who could maintain them was applied
to for alms by a poor woman with no less than five little
famishing urchins in her train the haughty dame not only
refused to relieve the unfortunate mendicant but poured
upon her a torrent abuse adding that she had no right to
put herself in the way having children whom she could not
support the woman dropped on her knees and prayed that
the lady might have as many children at one birth as there
were days in the year and so as the legend runs it
actually happened
 arrah give me the favors that sweet pretty creature the
comical muse at the waxworks who took me for a player och the
fascination her smile and the witchery her eye before all the
muses that ever fuddled the brain a garreteer
why baronet said the squire you are lovestruck deeply
lurched taken in by the knowing one
taken in that is as it may hereafter happen but an irishman my
jewel is never so desperately in love with one girl but he can spare a
bit affection for another
sure love is the soul a nate irishman
he loves all that's lovely loves all that he can
with his sprig shilleleagh and shamrock so green
the three friends had now rounded the corner at the bottom 
fleetstreet in the direction blacksmiths when dashall claimed the
attention his associates
this is the domicil said he the patriotic alderman who during
so many years has uniformly and ably opposed the civic hirelings 
corruption advocated the cause freedom and acquired the wellearned
meed high estimation by all the respectable and independent portion
 his fellowcitizens
firm in principle and resolute in difficulty the conscientious
discharge his duty has ever been his prominent object but perhaps in
no instance has he so greatly endeared himself to humanity than in that
 the long protracted inquest on the bodies the two unfortunate
men honey and francis the victims military outrage his constant
attendance and indefatigable exertions on that occasion were the means
 eliciting many particulars which otherways might not have been known
and which ultimately led the jury to record the atrociousness the
crime by the several verdicts murder and manslaughter
again on the memorable day the funeral these two immolated men
mr w in his capacity sheriff supported with becoming dignity his
high station and undaunted amidst imminent danger enforced obedience
even from the military and saved the effusion human blood
london exhibits daily a series depravity perhaps unparalleled in
any other part the british empire
 dashall had just finished his eulogium on the worthy alderman
in which his friends heartily coincided when the attention the
triumvirate was attracted by the appalling appearance five men
rivetted together and conducted along the street by officers 
justice tallyhoho enquired into the nature their crimes and was
informed that they were in custody under suspicion housebreaking in
the nighttime and that two them particularly had been taken in
the house which they had plundered regaling themselves in perfect
ease with cold meat wine and liquors and the stolen property tied up
in a bag with which on the moment alarm they attempted an escape
but were intercepted in their retreat and taken in charge by the
officers after a desperate resistance in which shots and hurts were
received both by the victors and the vanquished it is almost beyond
belief that men engaged in an enterprise wherein ignominious death
awaits discovery would sit down to regale themselves after having
secured their booty with as much composure as if in their own homes
yet so it is such is the daring callousness mind attached to long
confirmed and successful habits guilt
 police mansion house william johnson was charged by mr
miller lower thames street on suspicion having committed
a robbery on thursday night under circumstances 
rather an extraordinary kind mr miller's evidence was to
the following effect he has a cut glass and earthenware
warehouse in thames street but does not reside there upon
visiting his warehouse yesterday morning he found that
thieves had been very busy upon the concern the night
before they did not get much but while they were in the
house they enjoyed themselves they lighted a fire and paid
a visit to the winecellar from which they took two bottles
 wine and three bottles perry which it seemed they
drank warm with sugar and mr miller received a very polite
letter from one them acknowledging the obligations they
were under to him for the excellent beverage his cellar
afforded upon examining other parts the premises mr
miller found that his iron chest had been forced open the
instrument a large chisel with which this feat was
performed was lying on the premises and a dark lanthorn
which the thieves had forgotten was also picked up in the
course the search the petty cash drawers the iron
chest lay open empty but mr miller believed there had been
in them when he left the warehouse a sum perhaps not
exceeding a couple pounds the bills and papers were not
taken away neither had any thing been removed that was
likely to be recovered some silver cruettops were taken
but the cruets were left behind the chisel which
though very strong had been broken in the effort to open
the chest was the largest size all the rooms the
building except those in front had been visited by the
depredators and there were various circumstances concurring
to fix a very strong suspicion on the prisoner besides the
probability that he was the writer the letter thanks
to mr miller for the entertainment afforded the letter
which was written in a good hand began with the word
gemmen and stated that they the writer and his friends
had called regretted that there was no tassel in the
lob money in the chest but expressed the highest
opinion the wine begged pardon for disturbing the
papers and expressed how happy those who drank the wine
would be to visit the premises upon a future occasion the
prisoner was remanded
 it sometimes happens that even juvenile depredators who have
imbibed a propensity for liquor have been caught in the snare thus
laid by themselves this fact dashall gave the following very curious
illustration a few evenings ago said he the family my next
door neighbour retired to rest leaving every thing as they imagined
in a state perfect security on the servant however coming downstairs
in the morning he was surprised to find a new and unexpected
inmate fast asleep in the kitchen a quantity plate packed up lay by
his side and before him were a bottle brandy and another wine
he was a lad not more than sixteen years age who had ingeniously
contrived in the nighttime to get access to the house and having
secured his spoil had resorted to the pantry and winecellar for
refreshment the stores from the latter receptacle he had partaken
so liberally that he was thrown into a deep slumber from which he was
roused by the unwelcome voice the officer who had been sent for to
take him into custody
our perambulators had now passed along the bridge and advanced a short
distance on blackfriar's road when they observed a spacious travelling
caravan stationary by the side the high way intimating that there
was to be seen within the great northern bear known by the name 
autocrat all the russian while a fellow with a speaking tube
invited in the most alluring terms itinerant oratory the gaping
multitude to walk in walk in ladies and gentlemen and behold
this most wonderous all wonders that ever was wondered at in this
wonderful world the ursa major that gives its name to one 
the constellations and was taken by a ruse de guerre in one the
hitherto undiscovered deserts the remotest siberia this stupendous
animal was sent from these unknown regions as a present to a certain
great personage in this country who having a superabundance native
bears already prowling about him was pleased to order the dismission
 this northern stranger without a pension and thus it came into the
possession its present exhibiter
 this irresistible invitation was accepted by several the
auditory including the baronet dashall and the squire who were
gratified beyond their anticipations with a sight the great polar
bear the desolate inhabitant a frigid and dismal clime where
nature has forbid the vegetative and stinted the growth the animal
creation with the exception the shaggy wanderer the desert
and the floundering leviathan the ocean the animal was perfectly
tractable and its exhibition well compensated both for time and
gratuity
the proprietor however in answer to an enquiry apart by dashall
acknowledged that his ursine companion had never been attached to the
household any great personage although a northern quadruped 
lesser interest was under the protection one the royal dukes and
frequently played its mischievous gambols in the environs kensington
palace
 the bear at kensington palace early on sunday mornking it
was discovered that a large black bear sent as a present
to his royal highness the duke sussex had contrived to
break out his cage which was placed in a coachhouse
and bruin having an inclination to explore these premises
containing a handsome new chariot mounted the footboard
and began to play with the tassels he next ascended the
roof and the box the covering which became a prey to his
claws after enjoying himself as an outside passenger as
long as he thought proper he proceeded to examine the
interior the vehicle and turning from the box made his
entre through the front windows into the carriage which
bore serious marks his savage curiosity no one dared to
approach this northern visitor and in order to prevent
further depredations in his probable rambles guards were
placed with fixed bayonets until some keepers arrived from
a menagerie who secured him after great difficulty in one
 their strong cages
chapter x
oh the dear pleasures the velvet plain
the painted tablets dealt and dealt again
cards with what rapture and the polish'd die
the yawning chasm indolence supply
then to the dance and make the sober moon
witness joys that shun the sight noon
blame cynic if you can quadrille or ball
the snug close party or the splendid hall
where night down stooping from her ebon throne
views constellations brighter than her own
tis innocent and harmless and refined
the balm care elysium the mind
 the rapid succession novelty in a life in london where the
scenes like those a pantomime are constantly changing
from grave to gay from lively to severe
scarcely required those attentions which the hon tom dashall continued
to enjoy on the score arrangements for the gratification and
information his cousin he was ever watchful opportunities to
furnish new views real life and character to tallyhoho and who never
failed to profit by his observations upon men and manners for tom
notwithstanding the gaiety his disposition was an acute and
discerning companion who having mingled in all ranks and degrees 
society was able to associate himself with the high or the low as
circumstances might require and to form tolerably accurate estimates 
those by whom he was surrounded
it was therefore with his usual view to the accomplishment his
cousin as a votary real life in london that he had proposed a visit
to a fancy dress ball at almack's and preparations had accordingly been
made between them
a fancy dress ball said tom in order to give his cousin an idea
 the entertainment he was to partake bears some similitude to a
masquerade with two important exceptions first masks are not general
and second no practical jokes are expected or admitted dress
however is left wholly to the taste or inclination the visitors and
the amusements consist principally dancing and cards the rooms are
 the most splendid description and the company generally the first
order combining all that is elegant and fashionable in what is termed
the higher ranks society tis said
illustration pages attacks
if once to attacks you belong
like monarchs you can do no wrong
but banish'd thence on wednesday night
and enquire how the cash moves for you
know if your aunt is losing her money she will be as cross as the 
silence charles said his sister remember you have no occasion to
make such observations here why you might almost as well entertain us
with a pedigree the family as expose the tempers and dispositions
 your relations besides i am sure the party alluded to would feel
herself very much offended to hear such conversation in a ball room
it is neither a fit time or place and with this each 
his sisters seizing an arm led him towards the card room alternately
schooling him as they passed along and leaving our heroes to draw their
own conclusions from what had occurred
thus it is said tom that a commander in the field is obliged to bean
obedient in the ball room he is however a very poor creature at the
best times and depends more upon the abilities others than his
own for the appearance he makes in the world and is rather to be looked
at than admired and esteemed here continued he i shall have an
opportunity introducing you to a character another kind here is
my friend dick distich a logger rhyme a poet and a contemplative
philosopher he is recently married but appears to be without his rib
my dear friend dashall exclaimed a tall thin man advancing and
catching him by the hand i am glad to see you for i am bewildered and
lost
good replied tom then i am very glad to have found you what is
the reward are you advertised are your manuscripts stolen or is your
library on fire has the good woman brought forth twins or disappointed
your hopes
walk this way replied the other you are a happy fellow always
gamesome and gay but i know you have a fellow feeling for all mankind
and will pour the balm pity into a wounded heart
zounds said tom you attack a body with a mouthful pity and a
heart full wounds at a strange time for the introduction such
subjects what can you mean probably you appear here as the knight 
the woeful countenance with a determination to support the character
to the the chapter why you look as melancholy as a mute and one
would almost fancy you were making a funeral visit instead attending
a mask'd
i have enough to make me so was the reply i shall be brief in my
narrative in order that i may not interfere with your enjoyments and
you know that mine are another kind i am routed from home
how do you mean
thus it is then you know i am a plain man a quiet man a civil and
humble man i hate balls and routs but my wife and i differ in taste
she has determined on having a rout at home and it proves no
misnomer with me for heaven knows they rout me from study to drawing
room from drawing room to chamber and all because truly my little
woman must have her party
and why not enquired tom
why man for this reason you must know i had myself the sweetest
little sanctuary in the world i had gothicised my study its walls
were painted in imitation oak my books were arranged with the
most authorlike neatness my prints hung my casts and models all
bracketed and all have vanished like the
baseless fabric a vision
and is this your misery said tom upon my soul i began to think you
had lost your wife but it seems you have only lost your wits what the
devil did you expect when you joined issue to live as you have done
like a hermit in a cell well if this is all i do pity you indeed
but you have not heard half yet the whole house is transformed
and i think you ought to be reformed continued tom
notwithstanding the lightness and satire with which our hero appeared to
treat the subject poor distich was not to be stayed in his course
ah said he with a sigh in vain did cicero strain his neck to
peep over burke on the sublime and beautiful shakespeare beard blair's
sermons and humphrey clinker or milton's sightless balls gleam over sir
walter scott's epics all all is chaos and misrule even my greenhouse
over my head which held three cidevant pots mignonette one decayed
myrtle a soidisant geranium and other exotic which are to spring
out afresh in the summer my shrubs are clapped under my couch and
my evergreens stuck over the kitchen fire place are doomed to this
unpropitious hotbed in order to make room for patterns clogs cloaks
and shawls for all the old maids in town
tom bit his lip to stifle a laugh and treading lightly on the toe 
his cousin had so strongly excited tallyhoho's risibility that it was
with difficulty he resisted the momentary impulse
the routed benedict continued our drawing room which
conveniently holds ten persons is to be the black hole for thirty my
study dear beloved retreat where sonnets have been composed and novels
written this spot which just holds me and my cat is to be the scene 
bagatelle commerce or any thing else that a parcel giggling girls
may chuse to act in it my statues are converted diabolic is made to
hold a spermaceti candle while the medical nymph my apollo belvedere
and my dancing fawn being too bulky to move are adorned with aprons
 green silk because forsooth betty says they are vastly indecent with
nothing on them and my wife is quite certain that no one will visit
us unless we do as other people do alas until the success my last
poem we never cared about other people and i am now absolutely turned
out to make room for them and advised to come here tonight in order
to prepare myself for the approaching festivity
dashall was unable to contain himself longer and bob who had been for
some time stuffing his white cambric handkerchief into his mouth could
no longer resist the laugh he had been trying to avoid they look'd
alternately at each other and then at the doleful complainant who with
unaltered features sat for a moment between his laughing companions
till perceiving the ridiculous situation he was in he rose from his
seat and hastily left the room
our friends then took a further survey the company without making
any additional remark except upon the view the various elegant and
tasteful dresses exhibited the grace and agility the dancers and
the brilliance the decorations when supper was announced
moving onward to the supper room they again encountered poor distich
who although he had no relish for the generality the amusements
declared he would not quit till he had supped after which tom
determined if possible to drive away the blue devils who seemed to
have occupied his brain for this purpose he listened to his additional
complaints and filling his glass at every pause became lively and
agreeable as the toast was circulated till the invigorating effects
 the bottle sunk him again and at length putting him into a hackney
coach they dispatched him in good order to his rib after which they
took their departure towards piccadilly
chapter xi
i be one they sailors who think tis no lie
that for every wherefore there should be a why
that by fortune's strange weather a calm or a squall
our births good or bad are chalked out for us all
that the stays and the braces life will be found
to be some em rotten and some em sound
thus the good we should cherish the bad never seek
for death will too soon bring each anchor apeak
it was half past eleven o'clock before our friends approaching the
breakfast parlour had an opportunity congratulating each other on
the amusements the previous evening when the hon tom dashall ever
upon the active lookout for the most pleasurable amusements to occupy
the mind and attention his cousin observing it was a very tine
morning proposed a ride to greenwich and with this object in view all
being prepared it was not long before they were sell in a breath whose invitation dashall took not any notice i
hate importunity he observed to his friend passing towards the stairs
he was silently but respectfully saluted by a modest looking young man
without the obtrusive offer service trim your boat my lad
this was the business a moment now pull away and land us at the
shades elysium said the squire terminating the instructions
rather abruptly the amphibious conveyancer i am rather at a loss
to know said the waterman where that place is but if your honors
incline to the shades at london bridge i'll row you there in the
twirling a mopstick the very spot said dashall and the
waterman doffing his jacket and encouraged to freedom by the familiar
manner the two strangers plied his oars lustily humming in
cadence the old song
i was d'ye see a waterman
as tight and blythe as any
twixt chelsea town and horseydown
i gain'd an honest penny
they now glided pleasantly on the serene bosom the thames and
enjoyed in mute admiration the beauties a variegated prospect
which if equalled is at least not excelled by any other in the
universe on either side this noble river a dense mass buildings
presented itself to the eye and as the buoyant vehicle proceeded
the interest the varying scene increased in progressive proportion
thousands barges skirted the margin the lordly stream and seemed
like dependant vassals whose creation and existence were derived from
and sustained by the fiat old father thames and imagination might
well pourtray the figure the venerable parent this magnificent
stream regulating its rippling wave and riding in the triumph regal
sway over his spacious domains the grandeur the public edifices
on the left the numerous indications art on the right the active
industry on both sides and the fairylike boats pleasurable
conveyance gliding to and fro and shooting in the distance through
one or other the lofty arches waterloo bridge produced an effect
imposingly grand and was dwelt upon by our hero belville hall
particularly with mingled sensations surprise admiration and
delight
silence had prevailed for some time with the exception the waterman
who now and then carroll a stanza responsive to the stroke the oar
when the attention his fare was drawn towards him
you seem to enjoy a merry life my good friend said the squire
ay ay your honour god bless you why should not i at my poor home
and your honour knows that the cottage the peasant is equally dear to
him as is the palace to the prince there is my old woman with her five
little ones all looking forward to the happiness seeing me in the
evening after the labours the day and to feel that one is cared
for by somebody is a sweet consolation amidst all our toils besides
your honour the old times are partly come round again halfacrown
will go farther aye thricetold now than it did a few years
ago then hang sorrow i am a contented waterman your honour sod
n the pope long life to king george the fourth and success to
the land that we live in here said dashall is an heterogeneous
mixture prejudice simplicity and good nature
you are but a young man and cannot long have followed your present
profession is it from choice that you continue it
why your honour i served an apprenticeship to it am not long out
 my time and continue it as well from choice as necessity the first
because i like it and lastly as our parson says because in any other
situation i could serve neither my neighbour nor myself
by this time the tiny bark had shot the centre arch waterloo and new
scenes interest presented themselves in evervarying succession as
they proceeded towards blacksmiths somerset house wore particularly
an aspect great and imposing effect and not less as they ploughed
the liquid element was the interest excited and the reminiscence
 the squire brought into action by the appearance the temple
gardens the simple yet neatly laid out greensward reminded him 
the verdant slope on part his domains at belville hall but here the
resemblance finished a diminutive although pure and limpid rivulet
only passed the slope alluded to and here was a world waters into
which the influx ten thousand such rivulets would produce no apparent
increase amidst these cogitations by the squire and others an
unknown description by dashall the boat passed underneath blacksmiths
bridge and the lofty doom st paul burst upon the view the two
associates with gigantic majesty and withdrew from their minds every
impression save that the towering object in view superseding the
consideration all else either present or retrospective
rest on your oars was the order now given by the two friends and
while the waterman implicitly obeyed the mandate they gazed with
enthusiasm on the stupendous edifice seen perhaps to better advantage
from the river than from any other station and felt proud in
their affinity to a country and countryman capable the former 
instituting and the latter carrying into effect so august an
undertaking
 during the building st paul's church a country
carpenter applied to the overseer the workmen for
employment as a carver the overseer smiling at the man's
temerity hearing he had never worked in london it was
observed by sir christopher wren who was present who
calling the man to him asked him what he had chiefly worked
at in the countrypigtroughs c was his answer well
then says sir christopher let us see a specimen your
workmanship in a sow and pigs the man returned in a few
days having performed his part with such exquisite skill
that he was immediately employed and in tine executed some
 the most difficult parts the cathedral to the great
astonishment all that knew the circumstance so true it
is that genius is often lost in obscurity
 again proceeding on their way they arrived in a few minutes at
another amongst the many in the metropolis those surprising works
 public utility which reflect the highest honor on the laudable
enterprize the present times the iron bridge known as southwark
bridge leading from the bottom queen street cheapside to
the borough it is constructed castiron and from the river
particularly presents an appearance elegance and magnificence
consisting three arches only the spacious span each stretching
across the thames in towering majesty affords an aquatic vista equally
novel and interesting
gliding on the pacific wave the trimbuilt wherry now passed under
the lofty elevation the centre arch and our observers were struck
with the contrast between the object their admiration and its ancient
neighbour london bridge that nameless shapeless bulk stone and
lime with its irregular narrow arches through which the pentup
stream rushes with such dangerous velocity
this gothic hulk said the squire is a deformity in the aspect 
the river and ought at least to be pulled down if not rebuilt
added his cousin even on the principle economy the large and
incessant expenditure in support this decayed structure would
be much more profitably applied in the erection a new bridge 
correspondent grandeur with the first metropolis in the universe but
the citizens seem inclined to protract the existence this heavy
fabric as a memento the bad taste their progenitors
full many a gem purest ray serene
the dark unfathom'd caves ocean bear
full many a flower is born to blush unseen
and waste its sweetness in the desert air
 the indefatigable waterman continued to ply his oars sans
intermission and in a few minutes our two associates in adventure
were safely landed a short distance westward the bridge after
remunerating the waterman they ascended the stairs with an appetite
quickened by the water breeze and retired into the shades close at
hand for refreshment previous to a renewal their excursion
the shades near london bridge is a house or rather cellar much
resorted to by respectable citizens sober fame induced chiefly by
the powerful attraction genuine wines which may here be had either
drawn immediately from the wood and served in regular standard pewter
measures or in bottles also full measure containing the pure
beverage various age and vintages to these cellars numbers 
the most respectable mercantile characters adjourn daily enjoying
the exhilarating juice the grape and further attracted by the
pleasantness situation as commanding a full view the river
whence the refreshing breeze is inhaled and enjoyed
here then our heroes recruited and while taking their wine bob was
much gratified by the performance an itinerant band musicians
playing outside some the latest and most popular airs in a masterly
style execution among other numerous refinements and improvements
 the age observed dashall may be considered that our itinerant
metropolitan musicians for instead the vile discordant and grating
hurdygurdy the mechanical organ grinder and the catgut scraper
sawing a tune we have now parties who form themselves into small
bands really scientific and able performers who from instruments
well selected produce a combination delightful melody and this
progress harmony is equally evident with respect to vocalists who
frequently posting themselves opposite some well frequented tavern or
coffeehouse amuse the inmates with catches glees duets c and
trust to the liberal feelings which the concord sweet sounds may
have inspired for remuneration and encouragement
scarcely had dashall concluded his remarks when the musical
party ceased their instrumental exertions and diversifying the
entertainment one the performers struck up a song which we here
present to the reader as a subject not inapplicable to our work

it was but a few steps from the shades to the monument to which our
adventurers were now pursuing their way when they met with an incident
not unworthy observation do not leave your goods is the friendly
admonition generally inscribed in large characters over the resting
place for porters throughout the metropolis opposite the church 
saint magnus close by london bridge a porter having pitched his
load turned his back upon it and reclined himself against the post in
careless ease and security it was just as our heroes approached that
the porter had turned himself round to resume his burden when lo it
had vanished in what manner no one can tell without doubt one 
those numerous streetprowlers who are continually on the look out for
prey observing the remissness the porter had availed himself the
favourable opportunity and quietly walked off with his booty a crowd
collected round the sufferer but it afforded him neither sympathy nor
relief our associates however contributed in mitigation his loss
and proceeding up fishstreet hill were in a few moments shrouded
under the towering column the monument
ascending the spiral staircase black marble consisting three
hundred and fortyfive steps winding like a corkscrew to the summit
our aspirants reached their aerial station in the gallery this lofty
edifice and enjoyed one the most variegated and extensively 
interesting prospects any in the metropolis far as the eye could
reach skirting itself down the river a forest tall masts appeared
and the colours all nations waving gaily in the breeze gave a
splendid idea the opulence and industry the first commercial city
in the universe the moving panorama far beneath the giddy height
resembled the flitting figures a camera obscura the spacious
thames was reduced to a brook the stately vessels riding on its
undulating wave seemed the dwarfish boats the schoolboy navigator
and glancing on the streets and along london bridge horses dwindled
in appearance to mice and carriages to children's toys after having
enjoyed during several minutes the prospects afforded by their
elevated position the two friends descended and with a feeling 
relief again trod the safer and less difficult path terra firma 
our observers now turned their direction westward and passed into
lombard street chiefly formed bankinghouses and other public
edifices this street said dashall is noted as the focus wealth
the point convergence civic riches and its respectable bankers
are not more dignified by the possession superabundant property
than enhanced in the estimation their fellowcitizens by strictly
conscientious honour and integrity
and these not the least important in selfconsequence is the jolly
civic baronet continued dashall who has already come more than once
within the scope our observation
ecce homo behold the man responded the squire and the baronet
was descried rolling his ponderous form from the opposite alley to his
bankinghouse
it is rather unfortunate observed dashall that nature has not kept
pace with fortune in liberality to the baronet profuse in giving him
a colossal magnitude person he exhibits a most disproportionable
endowment intellect unlike his great prototype sir john in one
sense but yet resembling him in another he is not witty himself but
he occasions wit in others
you are very fond making a butt me observed the baronet to a
brother alderman by no means rejoined the latter i never was fond
 an empty butt in my life is the worthy baronet inclined at times
asked the squire in his capacity map to irradiate the gloom st
stephens
 o yes frequently particularly so when in the plenitude his
wisdom he conceives that he can enlighten the house with a modicum 
information the last time i heard him hold forth was as an apologist
for the tumultuary loyalists at the mansion house meeting when he
delivered himself in a manner so heterogeneous commonsense and
so completely in a style egotism as to excite the ridicule and
risibility the whole house and discompose the gravity even the
speaker himself
 the following is a strictly literal versification the speech
alluded to
the mansionhouse row and apology for
the loyalists
being a literal versification the eloquent speech sir
w ll m c rt s baronet in the house commons friday
february on the presentation by mr john smith the
petition the merchants london
i rise mr speaker indulgence entreating
a speech while i make on the mansionhouse meeting
the prior requisition was certainly signed
by men good substance with pockets well lin'd
with such i am ever good humour'd and civil
but worth without wealth i would pitch to the devil
the lord mayor i think then assum'd a position
 duty in yielding to said requisition
for may my oration be given to scorn
if ever i saw from the day i was born
a list more honoured more propertied men
and probably never may see such again
now high as i prize both the merits and station
 loyalists signing the first declaration
permit me to say it was too mild by half
too much milk and water some members may laugh
i care not i say that it did not inherit
the tythe a loyal and time serving spirit
i'm charged too with signing it nevertheless
i did for i knew not how else to express
my zeal in supporting with firm resolution
the crown and old england's decay'd constitution
who they are constitution and crown that sustain
the people should now else we labour in vain
and therefore i sign'd the forenamed declaration
altho such a weak milk and water potation
for why should the loyalists smother their cause
and lose the high gain ministerial applause
pon honour aye even in detractions despite
in corners and holes sir i take no delight
and never on any pursuit do i go
 which don't want the almighty to know
i signed sir the loyal lukewarm declaration
to bring to its senses a turbulent nation
to cheer up his majesty win his good graces
and keep his lov'd ministers still in their places
the honorable member my friend who spoke last
is not quite correct in detailing what pass'd
at the mansionhouse meeting for patiently heard
he was until symptoms riot appear'd
at last it broke out with a vengeance tis true
and dire was the fracas but what could we do
where adverse opinion so warmly prevail'd
and each with reviling his neighbour assail'd
why sir to this house i could prove in a minute
that greater majorities out than now in it
 sound thinking persons in these fair dominions
are scouting the honorable member's opinions
wellbred sir believe me and goodlooking people
were wedg'd in the mansionhouse quite a heap all
whilst i most politely besought their attention
but no not a word was i suffer'd to mention
a party oppos'd me altho no long speeches
i make a kind lesson that prudence still teaches
and waiting a hearing an hour perhaps longer
the dissonant clamour grew fiercer and stronger
in fact when i open'd my mouth the commotion
exceeded in fury the storms the ocean
some hale stout young men who had mix'd with the throng
and press'd the conflicting addressers among
escap'd from the meeting in tumult and smother
and swore that they never would visit another
i well recollect in the year ninetythree
a similar fracas i happen'd to see
the place grocers hall where contention was wrought
so high that a stout battleroyal was fought
indeed save one meeting i ne'er knew a case
where wrangling and fighting had not taken place
in that one so happen'd good luck to betide
its fortunate members were all on one side
reverting again to the mansionhouse row
when next our staunch loyalists mean to avow
their zeal may they issue a strong declaration
then mix'd with a water and milk preparation
the gout in my toe for i wore a great shoe
at last sent me home without bidding adieu
and now having said mr speaker thus much
i hope on this house the impression is such
the loyalists fully to clear and their leader
from charge at that meeting boisterous procedure
the honourable baronet now sat down amid the ironical cheers
 the treasury and the tumultuous laughter the whole house
 the two partners in adventure had now reached the mansion house
the justice room was open and the friends ascended the stairs in order
to witness the equitable dispensation right by the civic sovereign
the case now under investigation was a curious one and excited the
interest and amusement a numerous auditory
the itinerant exhibitor a dancing bear complained that the person
proprietor a small menage now summoned into the presence his
lordship illegally withheld from him a monkey his property and the
cidevant associate the ursine dancer aforesaid
on the other hand the master the menage roundly asserted that he was
the rightful proprietor the monkey and had been in possession the
animal for several years
my lord said the master the bear let the monkey be produced and
i will abide by his choice between this man and me as his master this
proposition appearing reasonable and pug having been brought forward as
evidence before giving his testimony made a respectful obeisance to the
chief magistrate and so far as chattering and grinning were indicative
 his good intentions seemed desirous expressing his courtesy to
the auditory in general after having stared about him for some time
with an inquisitive eye and corresponding gesticulation he discerned
the bearmaster and springing into his arms with all the eagerness 
affectionate recognition expressed the utmost joy at the unexpected
meeting and when the other claimant attempted to approach he repulsed
him in the most furious manner and clung to the friend his election
with renewed pertinacity
under these circumstances the monkey was adjudged to the bearmaster
as his proper owner and pug and his friend left the justice room with
mutual exchange endearments
nothing else meriting notice occurred to the two strangers in this
their new scene observation the civic sovereign having resigned the
chair to one the aldermen in order that he might attend the sessions
at the old bailey dashall and the squire at the same time retired
with the intention the day now waning apace making the best 
their way home which they reached without further adventure
chapter xiii
the charge is prepar'd the lawyers are met
the judges all rang'd a terrible show
i go undismay'd for death is a debt
a debt on demand so take what i owe
since laws were made for every degree
to curb vice in others as well as in me
i wonder we hasn't better company
upon tyburn tree
but gold from law can take out the sting
and if rich men like us were to swing
twould thin the land such numbers would string
upon tyburn tree
purposing to spend an hour in the sessions house at the old bailey
our adventurers started next morning betimes and reaching their
destination took their seats in the gallery for which accommodation
they were charged one shilling each which the squire denominated an
imposition inquiring his friend by what authority it was exacted
and to whose benefit applied as from the frequent sittings the
court and general crouded state the gallery the perquisites must be
considerable
custom in every thing bears sovereign sway answered dashall i know
not whence this is derived nor whose pockets are lined by the produce
but you will probably be surprised to learn that a shilling admission
is only demanded on common occasions and that on trials great public
interest from one to two guineas has been paid by every individual
obtaining admission
the arrival the judges now terminated this colloquy the lord mayor
and several aldermen were in waiting to receive them and these sage
expounders the law were conducted to the bench by the sheriffs 
london and middlesex the chief magistrate the city uniformly and 
right presiding at this court his lordship took his seat on
the same bench with the judges and the usual forms having been gone
through the dispensation justice commenced
several prisoners were tried and convicted capital felony during the
short space time that our associated observers remained in court
but the cases these wretched men and the consciousness their
impending fate seemed in no respect to operate upon their minds as
they left the bar apparently with perfect indifference
an unfortunate man was next brought forward and accused having
stolen from an auction room a couple wine glasses he was 
respectable demeanor and evidently had seen better days when asked
what he had to allege in his defence the victim misery preluding
his story with a torrent tears told the following piteous tale 
distress
he had been in business and sustained an unimpeachable integrity 
character for many years independence seemed within his reach when
misfortune equally unforeseen as inevitable at all points assailed
him in the course one disastrous year death deprived him his
family and adversity his property he had unsuccessfully speculated
and the insolvency several who were considerably indebted to him had
completed his ruin at the time he committed the act for which he stood
convicted at that bar he had not tasted food for three days neither
had he in the world a friend or relative to whom he could apply for
relief the jury found him guilty but strongly recommended him to
mercy the judge humanely observed that the least possible punishment
should be inflicted on the prisoner he was then sentenced to a fine
 one shilling and to be discharged a sum money the spontaneous
bounty the spectators was immediately collected for him while one
 the jury promised him employment on his calling at his house on
the following day the gratitude the poor man was inexpressible
the sudden transition from the abyss despair to the zenith hope
seemed to overwhelm his faculties he ejaculated a blessing on his
benefactors and departed
 dashall and his friend were much affected by this incident
another however presently occurred a more lively description
in the course the next trial the counsellor on crossexamining
a witness found occasion to address him with well my old buck
i suppose you are one those people who do not often go to
church perhaps said the other if the truth were known i am as
often there as you are the promptness the reply produced a laugh
in which the witness very cordially joined what makes you laugh said
the lawyer is not every body laughing replied the other true
said the man law but do you know what they are laughing at why
i think in my heart rejoined the fellow that they take either me or
you to be a fool but i do not know which
the judge at this repartee could not retain his gravity a tumult 
mirth pervaded the whole court and the discomfited counsellor adjusted
his wig and sat down
during the few minutes longer that our heroes remained nothing 
interest occurring they withdrew and passing down the old bailey to
lydgate street and from thence towards the temple they crossed fleet
street and taking the direction shire lane were induced by way 
investigating real life in its lowest classification to enter one 
those too frequent receptacles vice denominated coffee shops
this was a house notorious irregularity the occupant which had
more than once experienced the visitation the law for his utter
contempt social order and from the present appearance his guests
it did not seem that legal interference had effected moral amendment
as our two friends entered this augean stable a whisper surprise
mingled with dismay went round the motley assemblage female
streetdrabs cracksmen and oglehunters and a wary glance 
suspicion darted from the group many a time and oft on the newcomers
who notwithstanding kept possession their seats and ordering without
apparent notice the party a cup coffee apprehension subsided into
security the reassured inmates resumed their interrupted hilarity and
our adventurers were thus afforded the means censurable observation
 cracksmen burglars oglehunters pickpockets
 the squire who had not perused the annals blackguardism and
consequently was not an adept in the knowledge the slang or vulgar
tongue was under the frequent necessity applying to his friend for
explanation the obscure phraseology those ladies and gentlemen 
the pad which dashall contrived to occasionally interpret without the
assistance or notice its multitudinous learned professors
the desire witnessing the exhibition real life in its lowest
state human degradation induced a prolongation stay by our two
associates in the meanwhile the mirth and fun grew fast and furious
exemplified by dance song and revelry interspersed with practical
jokes recriminate abuse and consequent pugilistic exercise where
science and strength alternately prevailed and in deficiency other
missiles poker tongs coffeecups saucers and plates were brought
into active requisition the scene was a striking illustration 
confusion worse confounded luckily our two observers were in a
situation without the reach injury they therefore smiled at the
tumult and enjoyed the storm
the landlord now interfered in defence his fragile property
preliminaries peace were agreed on through his high mediation and
finally ratified betwixt the contending parties ending as they began
like many other conflicting powers statu quo ante bellum 
and now to serious business we'll advance says one the king's 
brentford
but first let's have a dance
the present party followed exactly mr baye's proposition the dance and
the row over they now proceeded to serious business
seated in various groups each engaged itself in conversation which
from its almost inaudible expression was singularly contrasted with the
recent tumultuous uproar
the next box where sat our two friends was occupied by cracksmen and
oglehunters one whom whose superior skill gave him an ascendancy
over his associates had delineated on the table the plan certain
premises and having given in a very low tone voice a verbal
illustration to his fellowlabourers with what intention it is not
difficult to conjecture observed we may as well pad walk it as
sir oliver the moon is not out to night
 the party to whom this remark was addressed prepared to pad it
accordingly when the desired egress was opposed by the entrance 
three men who unbuttoning their great coats exhibited each a hanger
and brace pistols and took the whole community male and female
into safe custody
this was a coupdemain on the part the captors and sustained with
the most perfect sang froid by the captured
the officers next turned their attention to dashall and tallyhoho who
giving their cards and candidly explaining the motives which led them
into the temporary society the prisoners they were treated with
becoming respect the officers with their captives proceeding on
their route to bow street and our heros to the occurrence future
adventure
tallyhoho congratulated himself on his escape from expected mortification
and inconvenience but dashall whose more active and enterprizing mind
was not to be checked by trifles enjoyed the vague apprehensions his
friend and by way making amends for the penance they had inflicted
on themselves in shire lane agreed to dine and finish the evening at a
tavern in covent garden
thither then as they pursued their course the squire expressed his
surprise that a final stop was not put to scenes such as they had just
witnessed and all such places nefarious rendezvous abolished by the
vigilance the police
on the contrary observed dashall it is the interest the
police not utterly to destroy these receptacles vice they are
the toleration haunts profligacy where the officers justice
are generally assured meeting the objects their inquiry and
therefore under proper restrictions and an occasional clearance
the continuance a minor evil is productive public benefit by
arresting the progress infamy and preventing the extension 
crime
passing along the strand the humane feelings the squire were excited
by apparently a mutilated veteran seaman who in a piteous tone 
voice supplicated his charitable consideration the applicant stated
that he had lost an arm and an eye and was deprived the use a leg
in the service his country without friend or home and entirely
destitute the means subsistence that he had no other resource
than that a humble reliance on public benevolence the squire with
his usual philanthropic promptitude drew out his purse but his 
friend intercepted the boon and inquired the seaman under whom in
what ship and in what action he had sustained his misfortunes to these
questions a satisfactory answer was given and the claim the man to
compassion and relief was about to be admitted when another inquiry
occurred are you a pensioner
a pause ensued in the interim the mendicant seeing a person approach
 whose recognition he was not at all ambitious dropped in a moment
his timber toe unslung his arm dashed a patch from his eye and set
off with the speed a racehorse
during the amazement our two observers real life excited by this
sudden and unexpected transformation the officer for such was the
quondam acquaintance the imposter introduced himself to their
notice gentlemen said he you are not up to the tricks london
that fellow on whom you were about to bestow your charity and who has
just now exhibited his agility is one the greatest imposters in
london however i shall not run him down at present i know his
haunts and reckon sure my game in the evening
i confess replied dashall that in the present instance i have
been egregiously deceived i certainly am not up to all the tricks 
london although neither a johnny raw nor a greenhorn and yet i would
not wish to prove callous to the claim distress even if sometimes
unguardedly bestowing the mite benevolence on an undeserving object
the society for the suppression mendicity in the metropolis said
the officer think differently they recommend that no relief should be
given to streetbeggars
then said dashall offended by the officer's interference i envy
them not the possession their feelings and the two friends renewed
their walk
proceeding without further interruption our pedestrians were induced
to intermingle with a crowd which had collected round a man who wore
a most patriarchal redundancy beard and had been recognized by an
acquaintance as a shoemaker the name cooke a disciple the
american prophet john decker
 their high mightiness the mobility were mischievously inclined
and would certainly have grossly insulted if not injured the
poor devotee had not dashall and his friend taken him under their
protectionist he had been quietly making his way through covent garden
market when the greetings and surprise his friend at his strange
transformation attracted the curiosity the multitude and his
unhesitating declaration that he meant to accompany the great prophet
to jerusalem excited derision and indignation against the unfortunate
enthusiast when luckily our two heros interposed their good offices and
conducted the proselyte in safety to the shakespeare tavern
 on monday in consequence a very great uproar on sunday
night in worcester street southwark about the house 
the american prophet john decker that singular person was
brought before the magistrates this office the
inhabitants the neighbourhood having attributed the
disturbance to the unfortunate fanaticism the prophet and
his followers
the constables stated that on sunday night at halfpast
eight o'clock they saw a mob consisting about three
hundred people collected at the door the house and
heard the cries murder issue from within the officers
on going up stairs found the prophet lying on his back
some persons who had been abusing him escaped and the
prophet said the cause their violence was that he had
refused to get out his bed to preach he was conveyed to
the watchhouse the witnesses informed the magistrate that
the prophet had made some proselytes who were actually
about to leave the country with him and accompany him upon
an expedition to the holy land the parish officers were
naturally alarmed at the inconveniences to which such an
emigration would expose them and hoped that every thing the
arm the law could do projected entertainment
 amidst the busy note preparation the important day at last
arrived the suite apartments became thronged with company and everyone
admired the elegance the furniture the tasteful ornaments 
the rooms the brilliancy the lights and massive construction the
valuable family plate in fact every thing conspired to give eclat to
the scene and confirm the friends the founder the feast in their
belief alike his exquisite judgment and high respectability
the silversmith that he might not appear indelicately obtrusive let a
few days elapse after this grand gala had taken place before he applied
for restoration his property the borrower congratulated him on his
good fortune told him that several friends had very much admired the
plate and even expressed an intention ordering similar services and
that with regard to the borrowed plate he had taken so strong a fancy
to it as to feel disposed to become a purchaser if the price was
reasonable and an adequate consideration was made for prompt payment
the silversmith who chuckled inwardly at the prospect extending
his business and connecting himself with so many honourable men
gratefully expressed his acknowledgments and assuring him liberal
dealing the several items the borrowed plate were examined and
dilated upon the price each article after much higgling was
ultimately fixed the sum total ascertained and an early clay appointed
for a final settlement the accompt it never was the intention the
borrower to return the plate but he now had achieved a great object
by entirely changing the whole complexion the business he had now
converted fraud into debt and happen what might the silversmith could
only sue him on a civil process which against a limb the law and
as such privileged from arrest must be tedious and uncertain whereas
had he made away with the plate without accomplishing the object 
this last manoeuvre such is the indiscriminating severity english
law that he might have been amenable to the punishment felony
now comes the reckoning when the banquet's o'er the parties met
for final settlement when behold the accepted purchaser offers the
silversmith a bill at a month he refuses it indignantly and consults
his solicitor as to the possibility compelling the restoration the
plate but the lawyer told him that on his own shewing this could not
be done the silversmith had now no other resource than that taking
the proposed bill and waiting the expiration the month for
payment in the meanwhile the debtor exhibiting the talent an able
conveyancer transmuted the silver into gold and now laughs at the
credulity london tradesmen and sets the silversmith at defiance
 this incident as related by dash all actually and very
recently occurred
an interesting and useful volume might be compiled on the
subject frauds practised on london tradesmen many 
these tricks have been highly characteristic ingenuity
the following is a ludicrous instance female stratagem
we give the article literally as it occurred
a few days ago a female apparently a person rank
visited in her carriage towards the evening a silk
mercer's shop westward temple bar where she made
choice for purchase silks and other rich articles 
feminine dress and decoration to the value above fifty
pounds her manner was that a perfectly wellbred
gentlewoman and her person displayed no small portion 
attractive and elegant accomplishment having completed
her selection she expressed much regret that she could not
pay the amount the bill on the instant butshe
continued it is a delightful evening my house is in the
suburbs town a short and easy ride will prove a pleasant
recreation and if you will accompany me home in my
carriage you shall on our arrival be immediately paid
the mercer was more gallant spirit than to reject the
courtesy a lady so fair and fascinating and accepting
with pleasure the preferred honour the vehicle soon
reached its destination the lady first alighted taking
with her into an elegant mansion the articles 
purchase the mercer presently followed was shewn into a
handsome drawingroom and received with much politeness by
apparently by a gentleman the faculty a silence a
few minutes ensued when the mercer inquired for the lady
observing at the same time that it was necessary he should
return to town immediately the courteous physician
recommended silence and the mercer became irritated and
clamorous for his money and freedom exit two
attendants making their appearance they were directed to
conduct the patient to his apartment the mercer
suspecting that he was the dupe artifice grasped a
poker with the intention effectking at all hazard his
liberation from durance vile but his efforts had no other
result than that confirming his trammels and he was
presently bound over to keep the peace under the guarantee
 a straightwaistcoat the unfortunate mercer now told a
plain unvarnished tale which gained the attention the
humane physician who was no other than the proprietor 
the mansion in which he managed its concerns as an asylum
for lunatics the lady who accompanied the mercer to the
house had been with the physician the preceding day and
made arrangements with him for the reception an insane
patient it was now discovered that she had come under a
fictitious name had retreated in the hired vehicle with the
mercer's property and had adopted this curious stratagem
the more effectually to silence suspicion and prevent
detection
 this detail threw the squire into a train rumination on the
tricks and chicanery metropolitan adventurers while dashall amused
himself with the breakfasttable concomitant the newspaper a few
minutes only elapsed when he laid it aside approached the window
and seeing a funeral pass in procession along the street he turned
towards his cousin and interrupted his reverie with the following
extemporaneous address
dost thou observe he said yon sable tribe
 death anticipates these are they
who when men die rejoice all others else
 human kind shed o'er departed friends
the tear reminiscence these prowlers
hunt after death and fatten on his prey
mark now their measur'd steps solemn and slow
and visage each doleful form that wears
the semblance distress they mourn for hire
and tend the funeral rites with hearts stone
their souls apathy would never feel
a moment's pang were death at one fell sweep
even all their relatives to hurl from earth
knaves there exist among them who defraud
the grave for sordid lucre who will take
the contract price for hurrying to the tomb
the culprit corse the victim the law
but lay it where think'st thou in sacred ground
no in the human butcher's charnelhouse
who pleas'd reserves the felon for the knife
and bribes the greater villain with a fee
cousin bob was very much surprised by this sudden effusion and
inquiring the source inspiration dashall put into his hands the
newspaper pointing to the following extraordinary communication
extracted verbatim
 the king v cundick this was an indictment against the
defendant undertaker to the cheesemongerlane gaol for a
misdemeanour in corruptly selling for dissection the body
 a capital convict after he had been executed contrary
to his duty in violathon public decency and the
scandal religion there were various counts in the
indictment charging the offence in different ways the
defendant pleaded not guilty
the case excited considerable interest as well for its
unprecedented novelty as the singularity its
circumstances it was a public prosecution at the instance
 the magistracy the county
mr nolan and mr holland conducted the case for the crown
and mr adolphus mr burton and mr roland were for
the defence
it appeared in evidence that a capital convict named edward
lee who had been tried and found guilty at the last
croydon assizes a highway robbery was publicly executed
at horsemongerlane gaol on monday the tooth september
after he was cut down he was delivered over to the
defendant the appointed carpenter and undertaker the
gaol for interment at the county's expense for which he
was allowed three guineas he received particular
directions that the afflicted mother and other friends 
the deceased were to be permitted to see the body before
interment and follow it to the grave if they thought
proper the friends the deceased called on the
defendant who lives in redcrossstreet to know when the
funeral would take place he appointed the following day
tuesday the th september the unhappy mother the
deceased being confined to her bed was unable to attend
the funeral but sent a friend to the house the defendant
to see the body and cut a lock its hair application
being made to the defendant for this purpose he said he had
already buried the body because he could not keep such
people any longer in his house the friend demanded a
certificate the funeral which he promised to procure on
a subsequent day upon paying a fee on the thursday
following the uncle the deceased called for a certificate
 the burial but could not get it the defendant then
saying that the body had been buried the day before the
friends then became clamorous and complaint being made to
mr walter the gaoler he sent repeatedly for the defendant
to come to the gaol and explain his conduct which he
declined at length one the turnkeys was sent after
him on the friday with positive directions to bring him
forthwith as soon as the defendant found that he was
compelled to go to mr walter he made an excuse that he
had some immediate business to attend to but would meet the
messenger in an hour at a neighbouring publichouse to
this the turnkey consented but watched the defendant to his
house where he saw two or three suspicious looking men
lurking about after waiting for some time the defendant
came to him and expressed his surprise that he was not gone
to the publichouse the defendant appeared agitated and
went off as hard as he could towards the southwark iron
bridge a person named crisp who was with the turnkey
went one way after the defendant and the turnkey another
the latter went to crawford's burial ground where he saw
the same suspicious looking man whom he had observed about
the defendant's house in the act interring a coffin
he immediately interposed and said the coffin should not be
buried until he examined its contents at this moment
the defendant came into the buryingground and
seemed angry at the interruption and begged he
might be allowed to inter the body which he acknowledged
was edward lee and excused himself for not burying it
before by saying that the pressure other business
prevented him the turnkey remonstrated with him for
disobedience the orders he had received to permit the
friends the deceased to see the body and attend the
funeral the defendant seemed greatly perplexed at length
he took hold crisp and the turnkey by the sleeve and
with considerable agitation offered them l each to
permit him to bury the coffin and say no more about the
matter this was peremptorily refused the turnkey insisted
upon opening the coffin and whilst the defendant went to
explain his conduct to mr walter he did open it and found
that it contained nothing but earth it appeared that the
defendant had been applying to the sexton in the course 
the week for a certificate the burial but was unable to
succeed the body not having been buried search was then
made for the body and at length it was traced to mr
brooks's dissecting rooms in blenheimstreet marlboroughstreet
where it had undergone a partial dissection the
upper part the scull had been removed but replaced
several persons identified the body as that edward lee
it was proved that about ten o'clock in the evening 
tuesday the th september a hackneycoach had stopped at
the defendant's house and the defendant was seen assisting
two men in lifting a large hamper into the carriage which
then drove off this was the substance the case for the
prosecution
mr adolphus in an able and ingenious address to the jury
contended that the indictment must fail inasmuch as the
evidence did not satisfy the allegation in the indictment
that the defendant had sold the body for lucre and gain now
there was no proof whatever that it had been sold which
might have easily been made out if the fact was so by
summoning mr brooks the anatomist the real fact was that
the body had been stolen by other persons from the
defendant's house and the defendant had been driven to the
miserable shifts proved in evidence in order to conceal the
misfortune and prevent the loss his lucrative situation
in the gaol
no witnesses to facts were called for the defendant but
several persons gave him a good character for honesty and
industry
the jury under the learned judge's directions found the
defendant guilty
 the squire having perused this appalling account human
depravity expressed himself in energetic terms indignation against
the miscreant who to the acute miseries maternal affliction at
the premature loss a son and by such a death could add the bitter
anguish consigning his cold remains unseen by any earthly spirit 
sympathy to the knife the dissector in breach every law moral
and divine in the warmth his kindly feelings the squire would have
uttered a curse had he not been prevented by the entrance his
old friend sir felix o'o'grady the two friends received their quondam
acquaintance with much cordiality cush la mevchree exclaimed the
baronet shaking heartily the hands tom and bob and how have
you done these many long days past this inquiry having been
satisfactorily answered sir felix explained the object his
visit aunts all sorts or any sort or no sort at all at all
said he are cursed bad things sure enough as somebody in the play
says
this abrupt commencement excited the risible feelings dashall and his
cousin which were further stimulated by sir felix seriously appealing
to their commiseration under the pressure misfortune for this
same respectable maiden lady mrs judith macgilligan my venerable aunt
as aforesaid has recently imported her antiquated piece virginity
from her native mountains near belfast and having had my address
pat enough the worse luck the soul with an affected anxiety for my
welfare must take up her residence while in town in the same house
with her dutiful nephew that she may have the opportunity watching
over him in his erratic pursuits as she says with maternal solicitude
that is in other words to spy into all my actions and bore me
everlastingly with her intolerable company it was but the blessed
morning yesterday that she took a fancy to exhibit her beautiful
person at the lounge in bondstreet bythebye this same paragon 
perfection has passed her grand climacteric being on the wrong side
 sixty is as thin as a lath and as tall as a maypole speaks an
indescribable language the mongrel kind between irish and scotch 
which she is profuse to admiration and forgetting the antiquity her
person prides herself on the antiquity her ancestry so much that
she is said to bear a strong resemblance to her grandmother judging
from the fulllength portrait painted seventy years ago that
worthy progenitor our family who was a descendent lineally
from o'brien king ulster that she copies her dress on all public
occasions to the great amusement and edification the spectators and
in these venerable habiliments she promenaded bondstreet hanging on my
arm by the powers till i felt ashamed my precious charge for all
the world was abroad and my reverend aunt was the universal magnet 
attraction
well and you find yourself comfortable said dashall we have all
 us foibles and why expect your aunt to be exempted from them have
you any thing in expectance is she rich
 twenty thousand pounds twice told replied sir felix
sterling money great britain in which i have a reversionary
interest
why then said tallyhoho you cannot do better than contribute all in
your power to her ease and pleasure and in exercising this commendable
duty you will gain present satisfaction and may justly anticipate
future benefit
and added dashall if my cousin or myself can by any means further
your object in contributing towards the full attainment your aunt's
amusement while she remains in town you may command our services
by the powers fortune exclaimed the baronet you have just given
me the opportunity i was wishing for that is i had a favour to ask
but which i could not find courage enough to do notwithstanding my
native assurance until now you must know then that on easter monday
the illustrious judith macgilligan descendant lineally from o'brien
king ulster means to honour the civic entertainment with her sublime
presence and grace the ball at the mansionhouse in a dress resembling
that her grandmother the princess worn seventy years ago now my
dear friends having pledged yourselves to contribute all in your power
towards the pleasure my venerable aunt which you will be her
partner for the evening
the pause a moment was succeeded by a hearty laugh tallyhoho had
no objections to the hand as a partner at the ball miss judith
macgilligan even should she choose to array herself after the manner
 the princess her grandmother but dashall observing that as no masque
balls were given at the mansionhouse it would be necessary that miss
macgilligan should forego her intention appearing otherwise than
in modern costume sir felix undertook to arrange this point with
his relative and in the name and on behalf squire tallyhoho 
melvillehall to engage the distinguished honour her hand at
the ensuing mansionhouse ball this important affair having been
satisfactorily adjusted it was proposed by dashall that as his cousin
and the baronet had neither them ever been present at the epping hunt
on easter monday they should form themselves into a triumvirate for the
purpose enjoying that pleasure on the morrow the squire having in
town two hunters from his own stud embraced the proposition with
the avidity a true sportsman and sir felix declining the offer 
one these fleetfooted coursers it was agreed they should be under
the guidance tom and bob and that sir felix should accompany them
mounted on his own sober gelding early in the morning to the field 
nimrod from which they purposed to return to town in sufficient time to
witness other holiday sports before dressing for the entertainment at
the mansionhouse
these preliminaries settled and sir felix agreeing to take a potluck
dinner with his two friends the trio resolved on a morning lounge
 observation and sallying forth took their way along piccadilly
accordingly
although it was sunday morning this street presented with the
exception the shops being closed nearly the same appearance 
bustle as on any other day the number pedestrians was not apparently
less and equestrians and carriageoccupants an increase the two
latter description the ton actually or wouldbe passing onwards to
the general sunday rendezvous hydepark where real life in london is
amusingly diversified and where may be seen frequently amongst
the promiscuous promenaders the mall a prince the bloodroyal
undistinguishable by external ornament from any the most humble in
the moving panorama while an endless succession carriages in which
are seated what england beyond any other country may proudly boast 
some the most beautiful women in the world present the observer
with an enlivening theme admiration and together with the mounted
exhibiters from the man fashion on the pampered prancing steed
to the youth hebdomadary emancipation on the hacked bucephalus 
rotten row form an assemblage at once ludicrous and interesting
having circumambulated the ring our triumvirate returned by the gate
in piccadilly and crossing from thence to constitutionhill dashall
pointed out to his companions the seat as now fixed upon on the
summit the green park a military pillar intended to be raised
in commemoration the many victories achieved by british valour in the
last war this plan if properly carried into effect by the erection
said dashall a column equal in splendor execution with
the glory it is meant to record will be the greatest ornament the
metropolis
if again added the squire it does not prove like some other recent
projections a castle in the air
 tallyhoho probably alludes to the long meditated monument in
memory the late princess charlotte towards the memory 
which a very large sum money was raised by public
subscription
without any other occurrence worthy remark the perambulators reached
home and enjoyed the comfortable quietude an excellent domestic
dinner without interruption every arrangement having been made for the
amusements next day the party broke up sir felix returning to
his lodgings to gladden the heart miss judith macgilligan with the
anticipation conquest and dashall and tallyhoho retiring to early
repose that they might encounter the business the morning with
recruited renovation next day
the feathered songster chanticleer
had wound his bugle horn
and told the early villager
the coming the morn
when the baronet made his appearance on a milkwhite steed before the
mansion dashall in a few moments the friendly trio were assembled in
the breakfastparlour and partook a hasty repast while the coursers
from the melvillestud destined to perform a prominent part in the
forthcoming adventures the day were getting in readiness the
preparations were soon completed the hunters two noble animals were
brought to the door
each with neck like a rainbow erecting his crest
pampered prancing and pleas'd his head touching his breast
saddle white surrey for the field tomorrow
was the order richard said the baronet but had he been in
possession such a horse as either these white surrey might have
gone to the devil
i'll warrant them both sound wind and limb and gentle to boot
said the squire come then if you wish to be wellmounted and would
really look like a baron bold seat yourself fearlessly on either
and bear yourself through the streets london with the dignity 
befitting a true magnanimous and puissant knight munster this
address had the desired effect it implied a doubt the baronet's
courage and he seated himself on the gallant steed immediately tom
and bob at same time betook themselves the former to the other high
mettled racer and the latter to the unassuming rejected rosinante
 sir felix a trifling delay however occurred the stirrups 
the baronet's charger were too short and he alighted while the groom
repaired the defect
now see him mounted once again
upon his nimble steed
full slowly pacing o'er the stones
with caution and good heed
whether like the slenderer's horse under the its guidance the
celebrated john gilpin the disdainful steed now in the management 
sir felix wondered what thing he'd got upon his back we are not
competent to decide but he certainly in his progress o'er the
stones manifested frequent impatience restraint these symptoms
 contumaciousness were nevertheless borne by the baronet without
complaint
till finding soon a smoother road
beneath its wellshod feet
the snorting beast began to trot
which galled him in his seat
and as if intuitively knowing the incapacity his rider to restrain
him and despising curb and rein the indignant animal set off at full
speed to the great dismay dashall and the squire who putting their
horses to the pith their mettle hurried after their friend with the
utmost solicitude luckily however the career the spirited animal
was impeded and finally stopped by the frequent interposition the
passengers on the road and the baronet was safely set down ready to
exclaim with hawser trunnion if ever i get astride the back 
such another harum sarum son a bitch again my name is not felix

the pursuers speedily rejoined the pursued and felt happy in the
knowledge his welfare the abashment the baronet occasioned
by this untoward adventure soon gave way to his characteristic
goodhumour and having resigned all further government 
the squire's unruly quadruped and resumed possession his own the
triumvirate proceeded towards the place destination
in the meanwhile the city horsemen arose with phoebus to mount their
nominates to be present at the enlargement the stag and were
roused from their slumbers according to order by the watchmen the
motley group that was early in the field furnished a capital subject
for the caricaturist carts horses lame mares and refractory conies
with their grotesque riders covered the field together with dandies in
chaises and the lassies from st giles's chicklane tapping and
st catherine's in market carts with their sweethearts considerably
swelled the number the hunters the stag was decorated with bunches
 ribbons and seemed when enlarged much more frightened at the
appearance the londoners than at the hounds his natural enemies
when the chase commenced never was witnessed such a scene confusion
and disorder upset carts and unhorsed huntsmen were seen in all
directions the stag went off in good style and out hundreds 
horsemen not above a dozen were able to keep their seats but a number
 fellows were on the lurk to take care the stray horses
after a cursory glance at the variegated and boisterous assemblage
the stag bounded forward with the velocity lightning amidst the
astounding shouts the multitude and was instantly followed by his
biped and quadruped foes indescribable diversity from the amateur
 the turf on his spirited and well caparisoned steed to the spavined
gelding bearing its cockney rider and numerous other annual
equestrians preceded by every description the canine race from
the high bred beagle to the cur low degree all was tumultuous
dissonance and confusion worse confounded tallyhoho enjoyed the scene
to the very acme delight and giving the reins to his experienced
courser high in blood and eager for accustomed exercise the noble
animal accompanied by its companion under the guidance dashall
started off with unrivalled celerity and in a few moments set all
competition at defiance sir felix in an attempt to follow his friends
leaped a fence but gaining the opposite side horse and rider came
to the ground fortunately neither them sustained any injury sir
felix however on regaining his footing found that his horse
which had gone forward was in possession a stranger who losing
his own had availed himself this opportunity remounting and now
pursued his way bareheaded for the wind had uncourteous uncovered
his pericranium and he abandoned his castor to its fate rather than
by stopping to pick it up risque the restitution his prize and
the wrath the baronet who stood spellbound against the fence
vociferously demanding his gelding and extending his arm in reiterated
denunciation vengeance the unceremonious intruder turning round on
the saddle without slackening his career bide you where you are
my fine fellow he provokingly exclaimed until the chase is over and
your gelding shall then be forthcoming if the sense misfortune is
alleviated by seeing it participated by others the baronet had ample
fund consolation for numbers around him were involved in similar
calamity he profited too by an admirable lesson patience under
disaster on the right his runaway gelding and its rider he
perceived a dismounted horseman quietly submitting to adversity by
seating himself on a bank while his unbuttoned steed pursued the chase
with abating celerity leaving its owner to wait at leisure its
return two cockney equestrians now approached at full speed the
fence where sir felix still stood in the attitude remonstrance and
irritation and attempting the leap one like the baronet gained the
opposite side but with a less successful result for the rider was
pitched over with some violence with his heels aloft in the air as if
about to perambulate the field on his hands while his horse came to the
ground on its face and knees suspended by its hind legs from the upper
bar the fence and vainly essaying at extrication the other cockney
sportsman was similarly situated his horse had not cleared the fence
neither had the rider although he had reached the neck his rosinante
in his progress to the opposite side in this position he assumed a
permanent aspect for his horse rested with his forelegs over the
fence and seemed incapable either retrograding or proceeding these
lessons taught the baronet resignation in mishap the result which
was the return in about an hour his friends tom and bob to his
great comfort which was further increased by their bringing with them
his gelding having recognized the animal in the possession a
stranger who on their claiming it as belonging to sir felix o'o'grady
very readily gave it up saying that the baronet had not forgot in the
midst his threats frequently to announce his name and hoping that
he would excuse him for having resorted to the privilege which every
person claims on this day taking care the stray horses the party
now fully satisfied with the humours and disasters the easter hunt
turned their steeds homewards and journeying unimpeded notwithstanding
the throng the road they quickly gained town without the occurrence
 any other memorable incident
having reached the mansion dashall sir felix acquainted tallyhoho with
the success his mission respecting the hand as a partner at the
mansionhouse ball the august descendant the kings ulster
the sage and venerable miss judith macgilligan o the beautiful
illustrissimo the sweet creature exclaimed the baronet with
commendable care her virgin purity and fair unsullied fame is
tenacious etiquette and insists that she shall be asked with all due
form and respect after i have introduced your squireship to the honour
 her notice at the mansionhouse by my conscience i believe she is
in love with your character and no doubt will prove desperately so with
your person faith and troth now she is both too young and too old for
matrimony too young because she may live to torment you these twenty
years to come which is a penance no sprightly lad should voluntarily
undergo for all her fortune and too old being in all respects
disqualified by age for the important object marriage which was
instituted for the procreation children
my dear sir rejoined the squire immaculate may the lady remain in
her person and property i have no views on either
by the powers charity retract that stern decree exclaimed the
baronet would you break the heart the lovesick nymph by chilling
indifference to the potency her charms and the magnitude her
fortune however all joking apart my good friends will you do my aunt
and your humble servant the honour calling at our lodgings we shall
wait your coming and proceed together to the civic entertainment this
was agreed to the baronet retired and the two cousins having the best
part the day still before them set out on a stroll to tothillfields
fair with the view ascertaining real life in westminster amongst
the middle and lower orders its extensive population
 crossing st james's park our two observers soon reached the
scene jollity here as in all the fairs held in london and its
vicinity was a vast assemblage idlers including both sexes and all
ages they talk the severity the times said dashall and the
distress the lower orders society i cannot say however that i
have witnessed any semblance distress or privation amongst such in
this metropolis to the extent represented in the whole course my
observation these fairs for instance more properly marts iniquity
are crammed to excess and in pursuit low enjoyment there appears no
deficiency pecuniary means in all these resorts dissipation
not only the shows are filled with spectators but the booths and
neighbouring publichouses are crowded with male and female revellers
the squire acquiesced in the correctness his friend's remark and
both coincided in opinion that the regular daily public places 
amusement in the metropolis afford ample opportunity for rational
recreation independent the continuance fairs which have no other
tendency than facilitating the progress licentiousness
dashall observed that on the present occasion in the midst so much
alleged distressthe booths and shows tothillfields fair were
much more extensive than in former years we must however said he
although the evil continues do the magistrates the justice to say
that they have acted meritoriously in preventing the erection those
dangerous machines named roundabouts by which at former fairs many
serious accidents were occasioned
illustration pages donkey cart race
while ton and bob were quizzing the costermongers and the senses
they in their turn were queered out their wipes thus another
cogent argument was afforded as to the necessity suppressing these
nuisances as being the rendezvous infamy and the harvest 
depredation the visitors appeared in all their glory as elegant
and boisterous as usual the consumption gin and gingerbread was
apparently prodigious and the great luxury amongst the fashionables was
fried sausages and the bolting oysters with sugar for wagers having
lost their wipes the two friends resolved at least to save their
tattlers and having seen a sufficiency westminster jollification
they left the fair to those visitors who might better appreciate its
enjoyment
returning home they were not encountered by farther mischance and
having shortly reached their destination and dressed for the evening
gala a chariot was ordered and they were set down at the lodgings 
sir felix o'o'grady
the baronet introduced his two friends to his aunt with much affected
form and with an arch leer expression which on an occasion 
minor import would have excited the risibility bob but this was no
laughing affair the presentation therefore was conducted with all due
solemnity and miss judith macgilligan received him with a maidenish
diffidence and complacency yet with the dignity becoming a descendant
 o'brien king ulster
having partaken a slight repast the party drove off in the lady's
temporary vehicle and rattling rapidly along the streets were in a
very short time arrived at the mansionhouse the company was select and
elegant the ladies particularly might vie in splendour ornament and
fascination personal charms with first rate beauties the west
and what gave the entertainment a superior zest above every other
consideration was the condescending affability the civic queen who
received her numerous and delighted guests with a truly hospitable yet
dignified politeness nor was there any deficiency on the part her
lord all that the most excellent arrangements and the most minute
attention could accomplish was done to the entire gratification and
comfort the company
 easter amusements mansionhouse the customary easter
civic dinner and ball were given at the mansionhouse a
material alteration was effected in the entertainment upon
this occasion by considerably abridging the number 
cards which it was the practice hitherto to issue the lady
mayoress received the company before dinner in the ballroom
in discharging which office her ladyship displayed
much ease and elegance manner the company adjourned to
the egyptian hall to dinner at about halfpast six o'clock
they consisted lord viscount sidmouth the earl 
shaftesbury mr peel and some other members the
ministry the lords bishop london and landaff and other
church dignitaries the lords chief justices england and
the court common pleas the vice chancellor several 
the diplomatic corps as well as the leading members the
senate and the army and other gentlemen distinction her
grace the duchess rutland and several ladies rank in
all about three hundred and fifty individuals both sexes
there were five tables laid out in the hall which from
being prettily ornamented with festoons flowers attached
to pillars along the centre each had an extremely
picturesque appearance upon entering the room after dinner
the usual toasts were drank and the respective parties
present returned thanks messrs pine broadhurst and other
professional gentlemen sung several songs and glees in
their happiest style at a little after nine o'clock the
lady mayoress and the ladies withdrew and the gentlemen
shortly afterwards rejoined them in the ballroom
at a little before ten o'clock the ballroom was prepared
and in a short time the most distinguished the guests
repaired thither the dresses the ladies were in general
particularly elegant the ball was opened by two the
younger daughters the lord mayor misses ann and harriet
magnae who danced the minuet de la cour in so elegant and
finished a manner as elicited general approbation the
quadrilles were led off by the duke de cases and baron
langsdorff and were continued with the greatest spirit
throughout the night the centre tables in the egyptian hall
were removed for the accommodation the company but the
side tables were retained and refreshments served out from
them in abundance
we believe that in the general participation pleasure
there existed one solitary exception only in the person 
miss judith macgilligan it unfortunately happened that an
opportunity offered not for the display her graces in the
dance she then became peevishly taciturn complained 
indisposition and expressing a desire returning home
the gentlemen consequently assented and the party left the
mansionhouse at an earlier hour than they had either
anticipated or desired

chapter xv
all london is full vagaries
 bustle splendour and show
at every turn the scene varies
whether near or still further we go
each lane has a character in it
each street has its pauper and beau
and such changes are making each minute
scarce one from the other we know
the in and out turnings life
few persons can well understand
but in london the grand source strife
is fortune to bear the command
yet some who are high up to day
acknowledged good sober and witty
may tomorrow be down in decay
in this great and magnanimous city
 apropos said the hon tom dashall laying down the times
newspaper after breakfast a fine opportunity is offered to us to day
for a peep at the citizens london in their legislative assembly a
court common council is announced for twelve o'clock and i think i
can promise you much entertaining information by paying a visit at
guildhall and its vicinity we have several times passed it with merely
taking a view its exterior but the interior is equally deserving 
attention particularly at a period when it is graced by the personages
and appendages which constitute its state and dignity london is
generally spoken as the first commercial city in the known world and
its legislators as a corporate body becomes a sort rallying post
for all others in the kingdom we have plenty time before us and
may lounge a little as we march along to amuse or refresh ourselves at
leisure with all my heart said tallyhoho for i have heard much
about the lord mayor the sword bearer and the common hunt all in a
bustle though i have never yet had an opportunity seeing any 
them
 they are interesting subjects i can assure you so come along
we will take a view these goes and magog civic notoriety
and thus saying they were quickly on the road for the city the morning
being fine they took their way down st james's street at the bottom
 which their ears were attracted by the sounds martial music
approaching
we have nicked the time nicely indeed said dashall and may now
enjoy a musical treat before we proceed to the oratorical one the
guards in and about the palace are relieved every morning about this
time for which purpose they are usually mustered at the horseguards
in the park where they are paraded in regular order and then marched
here it forms a very pleasing sight for the cockney loungers for those
out employ and those who have little inclination to be employed and
you see the crowds that are hastening before them in order to obtain
admission to palace yard before their arrival let us join the throng
there is another detachment stationed there ready to receive them
and while they are relieving the men actually on duty the two bands
alternately amuse the officers and the byestanders with some the
most admired overtures and military airs
they now passed the gate and quickly found themselves in a motley group
 all descriptions crowding to the seat action and pouring in
from various avenues men women and children halfdrilled drummers
bandylegged fifers and suckling triangle beaters with bags books
and instruments in their hands to assist the band the colours were
mounted as usual on a post in the centre the men drawn up in ranks and
standing at ease while the officers were pacing backwards and forwards
in the front arminarm with each other relating the rencontres the
preceding day or those in anticipation the ensuing this order 
things was however quickly altered as the relieving party entered
and at the word attention every officer was at his post and the men
under arms our friends now moved under the piazzas so as to be in the
rear the party who had the first possession and after hearing with
great admiration the delightful airs played by the two bands which
had been the principal object attraction with them they proceeded
through the park and reached charing cross by the way spring
gardens
 zounds said tallyhoho this is a very unworthy entrance to a
royal park
admitted it is so was the reply and a degradation to the splendid
palace i mean internally which is so close to it and which is the
present residence majesty they now proceeded without anything
further consequence worthy remark till they reached
villiersstreet
come said tom i perceive we shall have time to take a look at the
world below as well as the world above when crossing into the delphi
and suddenly giving another turn he entered what to bob appeared a
cavern and in one moment was obscured from his sight hallo said
tallyhoho where the devil are you leading me to never mind was the
reply keep on the right side and you are safe enough but if you get
into the centre beware the slough despond don't be afraid
upon this assurance bob groped his way along for a few paces and at a
distance could discover the glimmering a lamp which seemed but to
make darkness more visible keeping his eye upon the light and more
engrossed with the idea his own safety in such a place than any thing
else for he could neither conjecture where he was nor whence he was
going he presently came in violent contact with a person whom he could
not see and in a moment found himself prostrate on the ground
hallo cried a gruff voice which sounded through the hollow arches
 the place with sepulchral tone who the devil are you why don't
you mind where you go you must not come here with your eyes in your
pocket and at the same time he heard a spade dug into the earth which
almost inspired him with the idea that he should be buried alive
good god protect exclaimed bob where is dashall where am i
where are you why you're in the mud to be sure and for aught i know
dashall and all the rest may be in the clouds what business have you
dashing here we have enough the dandies above without having them
below what have you lost your way or have you been nibbling in the
light and want to hide yourself eh
 neither neither i can assure you but i have been led here
and my friend is on before
oh well if that's the case get up and i'll hail him
eyyaap cried he in a voice which seemed like thunder to our
fallen hero and which was as quickly answered by the well known voice
 his cousin who in a few minutes was at his elbow
what now vociferated tom i thought i gave you instructions how to
follow and expected you was just behind me
why for the matter that cried the unknown he was not before
you that's martin and he knocked himself down in the mud before ever
i spoke to him that's all i know about it but he don't seem to
understand the navigation our parts
i don't wonder at that replied tom for he was never here before in
his life but there is no harm done is there
none replied bob all's right again now so proceed
nay replied the unknown all's not right yet for if as how this
is your first appearance in the shades below it is but fair you should
come down
down said bob why i have been down you knock'd me down
well never mind my master i have set you on your pins again and
besides that i likes you very well for you're down as a hammer and
up again like a watchbox but to my thinking a drap o'somut good would
revive you a little bit and i should like to drink with you for you
ought to pay your footing
and so he shall continued tom so come along my lad
by this time bob had an opportunity discovering that the person he
had thus unfortunately encountered was no other than a stout rawboned
coalheaver and that the noise he had heard was occasioned by his
sticking his pointed coalshovel in the earth with intention to help
him up after his fall pursuing their way and presently turning to the
right bob was suddenly delighted by being brought from utter darkness
into marvellous light presenting a view the river with boats and
barges passing and repassing with their usual activity
what place is this inquired tallyhoho
 before you replied his cousin is the river thames and
in the front you will find wharfs and warehouses for the landing and
housing various merchandize such as coals fruit timber c weare
now under the delphi terrace where many elegant and fashionable
houses are occupied by persons some rank in society these streets
lanes and subterraneous passages have been constructed for the
convenience conveying the various articles landed here into the main
streets the metropolis and form as it were a little world underground

and no bad world neither replied the coalheaver who upon inspection
proved to be no other than bob martlet whom they had met with as one
 the heavy wet party at charley's crib for there is many a family
lives down here and gets a good bit bread too what does it signify
where a man gets his bread if he has but an honest appetite to eat it
with aye and though i say it that house in the corner there just
down by the water's edge can supply good stuff at all times to wash
it down with and that you know's the time day my master this warm
weather makes one dryish like don't it
tom thought the hint dry enough though bob was declaring he was almost
wet through however they took their road to the fox under the hill
as it is termed on entering which a good fire presented itself and
tallyhoho placed himself in front it in order to dry his clothes
while bob martlet was busy in inquiring the landlord for a brush to
give the german a wipe down as he observed he had a sort a trip up
in these wild parts though to be sure that there was no great wonder
for a gentleman who was near sighted and didn't wear spectacles
however continued he there an't no harm done and so the german and
i are going to drink together ain't we sir
tallyhoho who by this time had got well roasted by the fireside nodded
his assent and dashall inquired what he would like
 why my master as for that it's not much matter to me a
drap sky blue in a boulter barley with a dollop sweet
and a little saw dust is no bad thing according to my thinking but
lord bless you if so be as how a german like you offers to treat bill
martlet
 a boulter barley a drink or a pot porter
 a dollop sweet sugar
 sawdust a cant term for ginger or nutmeg grated
why bill martlet never looks a gift horse in the mouth you know as the
old saying is but our landlord knows how to make such rum stuff as i
should like you to taste it we call it hot don't us landlord come
lend us hold the brush ave and brush up mr landlord said the
hon tom dashall let us have a taste this nectar he's talking 
for we have not much time to stop
lord bless your eye sight replied martlet there an't no occasion
whatsoever for your honours to stay if you'll only give the order
and push about the possibles the business is all done come shovel up
the sensible continued he to the landlord mind you give us the real
double xx i don't think your coat is any the worse it would serve me
for a sunday swell toggery for a twelvemonth to come yet for our dirt
down here is as i may say clean dirt and d me if i don't think it
looks all the better for it
thank you my friend said bob that will do very well and the
landlord having by this time completed his cookery produced the good
stuff as martlet termed it
come gentlemen this is the real right sort nothing but the bangup
article ain't it my master but as i always likes the landlord to
taste it first by way setting a good example just be after telling
us what you think it
with all my heart said the landlord who declared it was as prime a
pot hot as he had made for the last fortnight 
with this recommendation our friends tried it and after tipping took
their departure under the positive assurance martlet that he should
be very glad to see them again at any time
they now pursued their way through other subterraneous passages where
they met waggons carts and horses apparently as actively and usefully
employed as those above ground
come said tom we have suffered time to steal a inarch upon us as
they reached the strand we will therefore take the first rattler
we can meet with and make the best our way for the city this
was soon accomplished and jumping into the coach the old jarvey
was desired to drive them as expeditiously as possible to the corner 
kingstreet cheapside

zounds you've cut off the alderman's thumb
the hon tom dashall who was fully aware that city appointments for
twelve o'clock mean one was nevertheless anxious to arrive at their
place destination some time before the commencement the business
 the day and fortunately meeting with no obstruction on the road
they were set down at the corner kingstreet about halfpast twelve
come said he we shall now have time to look about us at leisure
and observe the beauties this place civic festivity the hall you
see in front you is the place devoted to the entertainment usually
given by the lord mayor on his entrance upon the duties and dignities 
his office it is a fine gothic building in which the various courts
 the city are held the citizens also meet there for the purpose 
choosing their representatives in parliament the lord mayor sheriffs
c it was originally built in the year previous to which period
the public or as they term it the common hall was held at a small room
in aldermanbury
 the expense the building was defrayed by voluntary
subscription and its erection occupied twenty years it was seriously
damaged by the fire since which the present edifice with the
exception the new gothic front has been erected that however
was not finished till the year and many internal improvements and
decorations have been introduced since there is not much attraction
in its outward appearance that new building on the right has recently
been erected for the accommodation meetings bankrupts and on the
left is the justiceroom where the aldermen attend daily in rotation as
magistrates to decide petty causes but we must not exhaust our time now
upon them
on entering the hall tallyhoho appeared to be highly pleased with its
extent and was presently attracted by the monuments which it contains
it is a noble room said he yes replied tom this hall is
 feet in length in breadth and the height to the roof is 
tallyhoho was however more engaged in examining the monument erected to
the memory lord nelson and an occasional glance at the two enormous
figures who stand at opposites on the left the entrance having
read the tablet and admired the workmanship the former he hastily
turned to the latter and who in the name wonder are these he
inquired
these replied his communicative cousin are called gog and
magog they are two ancient giants carved in wood one holding a
long staff suspending a ball stuck with pikes and the other a albert
supposed to be great antiquity and to represent an ancient briton
and a saxon they formerly used to stand on each side that staircase
which leads to the chamberlain's office the courts king's bench and
common pleas the court aldermen and the common council chamber at
the other are two fine monuments to the memory lord chatham the
father mr pitt and his son the windows are fine specimens 
the revived art painting on glass there is also a monument mr
beckford
while they were taking a view these several objects curiosity
their attention was suddenly attracted by a confused noise and bustle
at the door which announced the arrival the lord mayor and his
attendants who passed them in state and were followed by our friends
to the council chamber on entering which they were directed
by the city marshall who guarded the door to keep below the bar
tallyhoho gazed with admiration and delight on the numerous pictures with
which the chamber is decorated as well as the ceiling which forms a
dome with a skylight in the centre the lord mayor having first entered
the court aldermen the business the day had not yet commenced
tom directed his cousin's eye in the first instance to the very large
and celebrated painting by copley which fronts the lord mayor's
chair and represents the destruction the floating batteries before
gibraltar to commemorate the gallant defence that place by general
elliott afterwards lord heath field in the statue the late
king george the third the death david rizzio by opine the miseries
 civil war from shakespeare domestic happiness exemplified in
portraits an alderman and his family the death wat tyler the
representation the procession the lord mayor to westminster hall
by water and the ceremony swearing in the lord mayor at guildhall
in containing portraits all the principal members the
corporation london at that time meanwhile the benches were filling
with the deputies and common councilmen from their several wards at one
o'clock the lord mayor entered the court attended by several aldermen
who took their seats around him and the business the day commenced
among those on the upper seats tom gave his cousin to understand which
were the most popular the aldermen and named in succession messrs
waithman wood sir claudius stephen hunter birch flower and curtis
and as their object was not so much to hear the debates as to see the
form and know the characters he proposed an adjournment from their
present rather uncomfortable situation where they were obliged to stand
wedged in by the crowd continually increasing during which they could
take a few more observations and he could give some little clue to the
origin and present situations the persons to whom he had directed his
cousin's attention making the best their way out the court they
found themselves in an antiroom surrounded by marshalsea beadles 
wards waiting for their aldermen and the lord mayor's and sheriffs
footmen finding almost as much difficulty to proceed as they had
before encountered
 having struggled through this formidable phalanx judicial
and state appendages
now said dashall we shall be enabled to breathe again at liberty
and make our observations without fear for where we have just quitted
there is scarcely any possibility making a remark without having it
snapped up by newspaper reporters and retailers anecdotes here
however we can indulge ad libitum 
yes replied tallyhoho and having seen thus far i am a little
inquisitive to know more i have it is true at times seen the names
 the parties you pointed out to me in the daily prints but a sight 
their persons in their official stations excites stronger curiosity
then said tom according to promise i will give you a sort 
brief sketch some them the present lord mayor is a very eminent
wholesale stationer carrying on an extensive trade in queenstreet
he ought to have filled the chair before this but some temporary
circumstances relative to his mercantile concerns induced him to give up
his rotation he has since removed the obstacle and has been elected
by his fellowcitizens to the high and important office chief
magistrate i believe he has not signalized himself by any remarkable
circumstance but he has the character being a worthy man perhaps
there are few in the court aldermen who have obtained more deservedly
the esteem the livery london than alderman waithman whose
exertions have long been directed to the correction abuses and who
represented them as one their members during the last parliament
when he displaced the mighty alderman curtis waithman is humble
origin and has like many others civic notoriety worked his way
by perseverance and integrity as a linendraper to respectable
independence and the hearts his fellowcitizens he has served the
office sheriff and during that time acted with a becoming spirit at
the death the late queen by risking his own life to save others his
political sentiments are on the opposition side consequently he is no
favorite with ministers
and if he were replied tallyhoho that would scarcely be considered an
honour
true continued tom but then it might lead to profit as it has done
with many others though he appears to hold such very light
 alderman wood has not yet been so fortunate as the celebrated
whittington whom you may recollect was thrice lord mayor london but
he has had the honour to serve that office during two succeeding years
he is a member parliament and his exertions in behalf the late
queen if they have done him no great deal good among the higher
powers are at least honourable to his heart
 sir claudius stephen hunter there is but little to be said
except that he has served the office and been a colonel the city
militia led off the ball at a jew's wedding used to ride a white
charger and is so passionately fond military parade that had
he continued another year in the office the age chivalry would
certainly have been revived in the east and knightserrant and esquires
have completely superseded merchants traders and shopkeepers
alderman birch is an excellent pastrycook and that perhaps is the
best thing that can be said him he has written some dramatic pieces
but the pastry is beyond all comparison best the two and he needs no
other passport to fame at least with his fellowcitizens
but last though not least under our present consideration comes the
renowned sir william a plain bluff john bull he is said to be the
son a presbyterian citizen and was rigidly educated in his father's
religion he obtained the alderman's gown and represented the city in
the year he is a good natured and i believe a good hearted man
enough though he has long been a subject for satirical wit he was lord
mayor in you may recollect what was related him by the literary
labourer we met with in the park anecdotes and caricatures have been
published in abundance upon him he may however be considered in
various points view as an alderman and a biscuit baker as a
fisherman 
how cried tallyhoho
why as a fisherman he is the polyphemus his time
his rod was made out the strongest oak
his line a cable which no storm e'er broke
his hook was baited with a dragon's tail
he sat upon a rock and bobbed for a whale
besides which continued dashall he is a great sailor has a yacht
 his own and generally accompanies
 royalty on aquatic excursions i remember a laughable
caricature exhibiting the alderman in his own vessel with a turtle
suspended on a pole with the following lines in imitation 
blackeyed susan said to be written by mr jekyll
all in the downs the fleet lay moor'd
the streamers waving in the wind
when castlereagh appeared on board
ah where shall i my curtis find
tell me ye jovial sailors tell me true
does my fat william sail among your crew
he is a banker a loanmonger and a contractor a member parliament
and an orator added to which he may be said to be a man wit
and humour at all events he is the cause it in others his first
occupations have procured him great wealth and his wit and humour great
fame
the worthy alderman's hospitality to the late good humoured and
gossiping james boswell the humble follower and biographer dr
johnson is well known and it is probable that the pleasures the
table in which no man more joyously engaged shortened his life to
write the life a great man is no easy task and to write that a
big one may be no less arduous whether the alderman really expected to
be held up to future fame by the biographer johnson cannot be
very easily ascertained however that wish and expectation if it ever
existed was completely frustrated by the death poor boswell
i recollect to have seen some lines the worthy alderman on the
glorious victory the nile which shew at once his patriotism his
wit and his resolution in that he is not to be laughed out the
memorable toast he once gave
great nelson in the grandest stile
bore down upon the shores nile
and there obtained a famous victory
which puzzled much the french directory
the impudence them there fellows
as all the newspapers do tell us
had put the grand turk in a pet
which caus'd him send to nelson an aigrette
likewise a grand pelisse a noble boon
then let us hope a speedy peace and soon
 whether the following lines are from the same hand or not
we are unable to ascertain at least they wear a great
similarity character
i give you the three glorious c's
our church constitution and king
then fill up three bumpers to three noble vs
wine women and whale fishking
 egad said bob if this be true he appears to knock up
rhymes almost as well as he could bake biscuits smothering a laugh
why replied dashall i believe that it has not been positively
ascertained that these lines which unlike other poetry contain no
fiction but plain and undeniable matter fact were wholly indicated
by the worthy alderman indeed it is not impossible but that his
worship's barber might have had a hand in their composition it would
be hard indeed if in his operations upon the alderman's pericranium
he should not have absorbed some the effluvia the wit and genius
contained therein and in justice to this operator on his chin and
caput i ought to give you a specimen which was produced by him upon the
election his lordship to the mayoralty
our present mayor is william curtis
a man weight and that your sort is
this epigrammatic distich which cannot be said to be destitute 
point upon being read at table received as it deserved a large share
 commendation and his lordship declared to the company present that
it had not taken his barber above three hours to produce it extempore
tallyhoho laughed heartily at these satirical touches upon the poor
alderman
however continued tom a man with plenty money can bear laughing
at and sometimes laughs at himself though i suspect he will hardly
laugh or produce a laugh in others by what he stated in his seat in
the house commons on the subject the riots at knightsbridge
i suspect his wit and good humour will hardly protect him in that
instance
 on a motion made by mr favell in the court common
council on the st march the following resolution was
passed indicative the opinion that court entertained 
the conduct alderman curtis on the occasion here alluded
to
that sir william curtis bart having acknowledged in his
place in this court that a certain speech now read was
delivered by him in the house commons in which among
other matters which he stated respecting the late riot at
knightsbridge he said that he had been anxious that a
committee should investigate this question because he
wished to let the world know the real character this
great common council who were always meddling with matters
which they had nothing to do with and which were far above
their wisdom and energy it was from such principles they
had engaged in the recent inquiry which he would contend
they had no right to enter upon not only was evidence
selected but questions were put to draw such answers as the
party putting them desired
that the conduct sir william curtis one the representatives
 this city in parliament lias justly merited
the censure and indignation this court and his fellow
citizens
 after taking a cursory look into the chamberlain's office the
court king's bench and common pleas they took their departure from
guildhall very well satisfied with their morning's excursion
it was between three and four o'clock when our friends left the hall
tom shalt being upon the qui vive determined to give his cousin a
chevy for the remainder the day and for this purpose it being on
a friday he proposed a stroll among the praysellers in smithfield
where after partaking a steak and a bottle at dolly's they
accordingly repaired
you will recollect said tom that you passed through smithfield
which is our principal cattle market during the time bartholomew
fair but you will now find it in a situation so different that you
would scarcely know it for the same place you will now see it full
 horsejockeys publicans pugilists and lads upon the lark like
ourselves who having no real business either in the purchase or sale 
the commodities the market are watching the manners and manoeuvres 
those who have
as tom was imparting this piece information to his attentive cousin
they were entering smithfield by the way giltspurstreet and were
met by a man having much the appearance a drover who by the dodging
movements his stick directly before their eyes inspired our friends
so strongly with the idea some animal being behind them which they
could not see and from which danger was to be apprehended that they
suddenly broke from each other and fled forward for safety at which
a roar laughter ensued from the bystanders who perceiving
the hoax recommended the dandies to take care they did not dirty their
boots or get near the hoofs the prancing prays tom was not much
disconcerted at this effort practical jocularity though his cousin
seemed to have but little relish for it
come along said tom catching him by the arm and impelling him
forward although this is not bartholomew fair time you must consider
all fair at the horsefair unless you are willing to put up with a
horselaugh
struggling through crowds who appeared to be buying selling or
bargaining for the lame the broken winded and spavined prays 
various sizes prices and pretensions
there is little difference said tom between this place as a market
for horses and any similar mart in the kingdom
here the friend and the brother
meet to humbug each other
except that perhaps a little more refinement on the arts gulling
may be found and it is no very uncommon thing for a stolen nag to
be offered for sale in this market almost before the knowledge his
absence is ascertained by the legal owner i have already given you
some information on the general character horsedealers during our
visit to tatters's but every species trick and low chicanery is
practised which numerous instances might be produced and though i
admit good horses are sometimes to be purchased here it requires a
man to be perfectly upon his guard as to who he deals with and how he
deals although the regulations the market are generally speaking
good
i wouldn't have him at no price said a costermonger who it appeared
was bargaining for a donkey the h y sulky b won't budge
he's not worth a fig out a horses 
i knows better as that are cried a chimneysweeper for no better
an't no yare to be had he's long backed and strong legged here bill
you get upon him and give him rump steaks and he'll run like the devil
after a parson
here bill a little bleareyed chimneysweeper mounted the poor animal
and belaboured him most unmercifully without producing any other effect
than kicking up behind and most effectually placing poor bill in the
 mud to the great discomfiture the donkey seller and the
mirth the spectators the animal brayed the bystanders laughed and
the bargain like poor bill was off
after a complete turn round smithfield hearing occasionally the
chaffing its visitants and once or twice being nearly run over
they took their departure from this scene bustle bargaining and
confusion taking their way down kingstreet up lowborn hill and along
great queenstreet
now said tom we will have a look in at covent garden theatre the
exile is produced there with great splendour the piece is certainly got
up in a style the utmost magnificence and maintains its ground in
the theatre rather upon that score than its really interesting dialogue
though some the scenes are well worked up and have powerful claims
upon approbation the original has been altered abridged and by some
termed amended in order to introduce a gorgeous coronation a popular
species entertainment lately
upon entering the theatre tallyhoho was almost riveted in attention
to the performance and the latter scene closed upon him with all its
splendid pageantry before he discovered that his cousin had given him
the slip and a dashing cyprian the first order was seated at his
elbow with whom entering into a conversation the minutes were not
measured till dashall's return who perceiving he was engaged appeared
inclined to retire and leave the cooing couple to their apparently
agreeable teteastute bob however observing him immediately wished
his fair incognita good night and joined his cousin
d d dull said tom all weary stale flat and unprofitable
but very grand rejoined bob
i have found nothing to look at replied tom i have hunted every
part the house and only seen two persons i know
and i said tallyhoho have been all the while looking at the piece
which piece do you mean the one beside you or the one before you
the performance the coronation
i have had so much that said tom that finding you so close inattention
to the stage that i could get no opportunity 
speaking to you i have been hunting for other game and have almost
wearied myself in the pursuit without success so that i am for quitting
the premises and making a call at a once celebrated place near at hand
which used to be called the finish come along therefore unless you
have mettle more attractive perhaps you have some engagements
none upon earth to supersede the one i have with you was the reply
upon which they left the house and soon found themselves in covent
garden market this said tom has been the spot many larks and
sprees almost all descriptions ana election wit has been as cheap
in the market as any the vegetables the venders but i am going
to take you to a small house that has in former times been the resort 
the greatest wits the age sheridan fox and others their time
have not disdained to be its inmates nor is it now deserted by the
votaries genius though considerably altered and conducted ina
different manner it still however affords much amusement and
accommodation it was formerly well known by the appellation the
finish and was not opened till a late hour in the night and as at
the present moment is generally shut up between and o'clock
and reopened for the accommodation the market people at in the
morning the most respectable persons resident in the neighbourhood
assemble to refresh themselves after the labours the day with a glass
 ale spirits or wine as they draw no porter the landlord is a
pleasant fellow enough and there is a pretty neat dressing young lass
in the bar whom i believe to be his sister this is the house
house said bob why this is a deviation from the customary buildings
 london it appears to have no up stairs rooms
never mind that continued dashall there is room enough for us i
dare say and after your visit to the woolpack i suppose you can stand
smoke if you can't stand fire
by this time they had entered the carpenter's arms when turning short
round the bar they found themselves in a small room pretty well filled
with company enjoying their glasses and puffing their pipes in the
right hand corner sat an undertaker who having just obtained a victory
over his opposite neighbour was humming a stave to himself
indicative his satisfaction at the result the contest which it
afterwards appeared was for two mighty's while his opponent was
shrugging up his shoulders with a feeling a very different kind
it's no use said jemmy as they called him for you to enter
the lists along with me for you know very well i must have you at
last
and no doubt it will prove a good fit said an elderly shoemaker
 respectable appearance who seemed to command the reverence the
company for all us are subject to the pinch 
there's no certainty his assertion however replied the
unsuccessful opponent jemmy
surely not said another most emphatically taking a pinch 
snuff and offering it to the shoemaker for you know jemmy may come to
the finch before john
 mighty this high sounding title has recently been
given to a full glass ale the usual quantity what is
termed a glass being half a pint generally supplied in a
large glass which would hold more and which when filled is
consequently subjected to an additional charge
 to those who are in the habit frequenting the house
this gentleman will immediately be known as he usually
smokes his pipe there an afternoon and evening
with his friend and his pipe puffing sorrow away and with
honest old stingo still soaking his clay
with a certain demonstration before him the mortality 
human life he deposits the bodies his friends and
neighbours in the earth and buries the recollection them
in a cloud determined it should seem to verify the words
 the song that
the right life is to live and be jolly
his countenance and manners seldom fail to excite
risibility notwithstanding the solemnity his calling
and there can be little doubt but he is the finisher 
many after the finish he is however generally good
humoured communicative and facetious and seldom refuses
to see any person in company for a mighty usually
concluding the result with a mirthful ditty or a doleful
countenance according to the situation in which he is left
as a winner or a loser and in either case accompanied with
a brightness visage or a dull dismal countenance
indicative the event which sets description at defiance
and can only be judged by being seen
 surely not are words in such constant use by one
gentleman who is frequently to be met in this room that the
character alluded to can scarcely be mistaken he is partial
to a pinch snuff but seldom carries a box his own he
is a resident in the neighbourhood up to snuff and
probably like other men sometimes snuffy this however
without disparagement to his general character which is
that a respectable tradesman he is fond a lark a
bit gig and an argument has a partiality for good
living a man feeling and a dealer in felt who wishes
every one to wear the cap that fits him
 never mind continued jemmy i take my chance in this life
and sing toll de roll loll 
by this time our friends being supplied with mightiest joined in the
laugh which was going round at the witty sallies the speakers
it is possible i may go first said the undertaker resuming his pipe
and if i should i can't help it
surely not but i tell you what jemmy if you are not afraid i'll
see you for two more mightiest before i go and i summons you to shew
cause
d n your summons cried the former unsuccessful opponent 
the risible undertaker who at the word summons burst into a hearty
laugh in which he was immediately joined by all but the last speaker
the summons is a sore place said jemmy
surely not i did not speak to him i spoke to you sir and i have a
right to express myself as i please if that gentleman has an antipathy
to a summons am i to be tonguetied although he may sport with
sovereigns he must be accountable to plebeians and if i summons you to
shew cause i see no reason why he should interrupt our conversation
 d n your summons this as one the company
afterwards remarked was a sore place and uttered at a
moment when the irritation was strong on the affected part
the speaker is a well known extensive dealer in the pottery
staffordshire and glass line who a short time since in a
playful humour caught a sovereign tossed up by another
frequenter the room and passed it to a third the
original possessor sought restitution from the person who
took the sovereign from his hand but was referred to the
actual possessor but refused to make the application the
return the money was formally demanded the man 
porcelain pitchers and pipkin without avail in this
state things the loser obtained a summons against the
taker and the result as might be expected was compulsion
to restore the lost sovereign to the loving subject
together with the payment the customary expenses a
circumstance which had the effect causing great anger in
the mind the dealer in brittle wares whether he broke
any the valuable articles in his warehouse in consequence
has not been ascertained but it appears for a time to have
broken a friendship between the parties concerned such
breaches however are perhaps easier healed than broken or
cracked crockery
 surely not was reverberated round the room accompanied with
a general laugh against the interrupter who seizing the paper appeared
to read without noticing what was passing
the company was now interrupted by the entrance several strangers
and our two friends departed on their return homeward for the evening
chapter xvii
roam where you will o'er london's wide domains
the mind new source various feeling gains
explore the giddy town its squares its streets
the filtered eye still fresh attraction greets
here spires and towers in countless numbers rise
and lift their lofty summits to the skies
wilt thou ascend then cast thine eyes below
and view the motley groupes joy and woe
lo they whom heaven with affluence hath blest
scowl with cold contumely on those distrest
and pleasure's maze the wealthy caitiffs thread
while careworn merit asks in vain for bread
yet short their weal or woe a general doom
on all awaits oblivion in the tomb
 our heros next morning determined on a visit to their
hibernian friend and his aunt whom they found had not yet forgot the
entertainment at the mansionhouse and which still continued to be the
favorite topic conversation sir felix expressed his satisfaction
that the worthy citizens london retained with increasing splendor
their long established renown preeminent distinction in the art 
good living
and let us hope said dashall that they will not at any future
period be reduced to the lamentable necessity restraining the
progress epicurism as in the year when the lord mayor and
common council enacted a sumptuary law to prevent luxurious eating by
which it was ordered that the mayor should confine himself to seven
aldermen and sheriffs to six and the swordbearer to four dishes
at dinner or supper under the penalty forty shillings for each
supernumerary dish
a law rejoined the baronet which voluptuaries the present
times would find more difficult observance than any enjoined by the
decalogue
the squire suggested the expediency a similar enactment with a
view to productive results for were the wealthy citizens he
observed prohibited the indulgence luxurious eating under certain
penalties the produce would be highly beneficial to the civic treasury
the fine arts claiming a priority notice the party determined on
visiting a few the private and public exhibitions
london is now much and deservedly distinguished for the cultivation 
the fine arts the commotions on the continent operated as a hurricane
on the productions 
genius and the finest works ancient and modern times ave been
removed from their old situations to the asylum afforded by the wooden
walls britain many them have therefore been consigned to this
country and are now in the collections our nobility and gentry
chiefly in and about the metropolis
although france may possess the greatest number the larger works 
the old masters yet england undoubtedly possesses the greatest portion
 their firstrate productions which is accounted for by the great
painters exerting all their talents on such pictures as were not too
large to be actually painted by their own hands while in their larger
works they resorted to inferior assistance pictures therefore this
kind being extremely valuable and at the same time portable england
during the convulsions said he the
park at nightfall presented a very sombre aspect being so imperfectly
lighted as to encourage the resort the most depraved characters 
both sexes and although in several instances a general caption by
direction the police was made these nocturnal visitants yet
the evil still remained when a brilliant remedy at last was found by
entirely irradiating the darkness hitherto so favourable to the career
 licentiousness these lamps each at a short distance from the
other have been lately introduced stretching along the mall and
circumscribing the park they shed a noontide splendor on the solitude
 midnight they are lighted with gas and continue burning from
sunset to daybreak combining ornament with utility thus vice has been
banished from her wonted haunts and the park has become a respectable
evening promenade
this park continued the communicative dashall which is nearly two
miles in circuit was enclosed by king charles who planted the
avenues made the canal and the aviary adjacent to the birdcage walk
which took its name from the cages hung in the trees but the present
fine effect the piece ground within the railing is the fruit 
the genius the celebrated mr brown
 st james's park was the frequent promenade king
charles here he was to be seen almost daily unattended
except by one or two his courtiers and his favorite
greyhounds intermixing with his subjects in perfect
confidence their loyalty and attachment his brother
james one day remonstrating with him on the impolicy thus
exposing his person james rejoined his majesty take
care yourself and be under no apprehension for me my
people will never kill me to make you king
in more recent times mr charles townshend used every
morning as he came to the treasury to pass by the canal in
the park and feed the ducks with bread or corn which he
brought in his pocket for that purpose one morning having
called his affectionate friends the dickey dickey
duchies he found unfortunately that he had forgotten them
poor duchies he cried i am sorry i am in a hurry and
cannot get you some bread but here is sixpence for you to
buy some and threw the ducks a sixpence which one them
gobbled up at the office he very wisely told the story to
some gentlemen with whom he was to dine there being ducks
for dinner one the gentlemen ordered a sixpence to be
put into the body a duck which he gave charles to cut
up our hero surprised at finding a sixpence among the
seasoning bade the waiter send up his master whom he
loaded with epithets rascal and scoundrel and swore
bitterly that he would have him prosecuted for robbing the
king his ducks for said he gentlemen this very
morning did i give this sixpence to one the ducks in the
canal in st james's park
 the party now seated themselves on one the benches in the
mall opposite the spot where lately stood the chinese or pagoda bridge
tallyhoho had often animadverted on the absurdity the late inconvenient
and heterogeneous wooden structure which had been erected at a
considerable public expense its dangling nondescript ornaments and
tiresome acclivity and descent forty steps each what said he
notwithstanding the protection by sentinels this precious memento 
vitiated taste has it become the prey dilapidation
rather answered dashall premature decay its crazy condition
induced the sage authors its origin to hasten its destruction like
the cherokee chief who when the object his regard becomes no longer
useful buries him alive
contrasting the magnificent appearance the adjacent edifices as
seen from the park with one apparently very humble pretensions miss
macgilligan inquired to what purpose the shabby fabric was applied
and by whom occupied
that shabby fabric madam responded dashall is st james's
palace erected by henry viii in which our sovereigns england
have held their courts from the reign queen anne to that his late
majesty george iii 
 the state apartments now renovated comprehend six
chambers the first is the guard chamber at the top the
stairs this has been entirely repaired and on the right
hand there is a characteristic chimneypiece instead the
illshaped clumsy fireplace which previously disgraced this
approach to the grand rooms the next room continuing to
advance is the presence chamber this chamber has been
remodelled and a large handsome octagonal window
introduced this produces the best effect and has rendered
a gloomy room very light and cheerful the privy chamber
which forms the eastern the great suite that runs
from east to west parallel to the mall in the park and is
strictly speaking the immediate scene the court this is
entirely new from the foundation and is a continuation 
the old suite state apartments the chamber is noble
dimensions being nearly feet in length and having four
windows towards the garden and park beyond a magnificent
marble chimneypiece occupies the centre on the east 
the antidrawingroom and the drawingroom in which little
alteration appears except in the introduction splendid
chimneypieces statuary marble taken from the library 
queen caroline in the stable yard built by kent the
workmanship these is amazingly fine and the designs very
rich the throne is at the upper the drawing room no
 and from the chimney the room no the vista through
the middle doors the antidrawingrooms is about 
feet the coup d'oeil must be indescribably grand when
all the three apartments are filled with rank and beauty
the ceilings the principal rooms and are coved
upon handsome cornices carved and gilt this gives the
apartments a spacious and lofty appearance and there being
four large windows in each the whole suite is very
imposing the rooms are to be fitted with mirrors and a
noble collection the royal pictures over the chimney in
the drawingroom lawrence's splendid portrait george
 surrounded by the fine old carvings grinding

excelled if equalled by any others in europe holbein
whom we have just mentioned was a favourite henry viii
one day when the painter was privately drawing a lady's
picture for the king a nobleman forced himself into the
chamber holbein threw him down stairs the peer cried out
holbein bolted himself in escaped over the roof the
house and running directly to the king fell on his knees
and besought his majesty to pardon him without declaring
the offence the king promised to forgive him if he would
tell the truth immediately arrives the lord with his
complaint after hearing the whole his majesty said to the
nobleman you have behaved in a manner unworthy your
rank i tell you seven peasants i can make so many
lords but not one holbein be gone and remember this if
you ever presume to avenge yourself i shall look on an
injury you do to the painter as done to me
 the descendant o'brien was astonished and connecting her
ideas the internal show this palace with its outward appearance
doubted not secretly that it was far inferior to the residence informer
times her royal progenitor
probably guessing her thoughts dashall proceeded to observe that the
palace was venerable from age and in its interior decoration that it
fully corresponded in splendor with the regal purposes to which it had
been so long applied it is now however he added about to assume a
still more imposing aspect being under alterations and adornments
for the reception the court his present majesty which when
completed will render it worthy the presence the sovereign this
great empire
 the sole use made lately st james's palace is for purposes
 state in the southeastern wing the building was destroyed
by fire the state apartments were however uninjured and the court 
george the third and his queen was held here
on the right the palace the attention the party was next
attracted by marlborough house it was built in the reign queen anne
by the public at the expense l on part the royal gardens
and given by the queen and parliament on a long lease to the great
duke marlborough it is a handsome building much improved late
years and has a garden extending to the park and forms a striking
contrast to the adjoining palace st james's it is now the town
residence his royal highness prince leopold saxe coburg
our party now passed into st james'sstreet where miss macgilligan
whose certitude temper had been much softened by the politeness 
her friends during the morning's ramble mentioned that she had a visit
to make on an occasion etiquette and requesting the honour 
the gentlemen's company to dinner she was handed by the squire
 melvillehall with all due gallantry and obeisance into a
hackneychariot tom in the meanwhile noting its number in the
anticipation its ultimately proving a requisite precaution
the trio now left to their own pursuits lounged leisurely up st
james'sstreet and pausing at the caricature shop an incident occurred
which placed in a very favorable point view the baronet's promptitude
 reply and equanimity temper having had recourse to his glasses
lie stood on the pavement examining the prints unobservant any
other object when a porter with a load brushed hastily forward and
coming in contact with the baronet put him involuntarily by the
violence the shock to the left about face without the word either
 caution or command damn your spectacles at same time exclaimed
the fellow thank you my good friend rejoined sir felix it is not
the first time that my spectacles have saved my eyes
 remarking on this rencounter dashall observed that the
insolence these fellows was become really a public nuisance armed in
the panoply arrogance they assume the right the footway to the
ejection danger and frequent injury other passengers moving in a
direct line with loads that sometimes stretch on either side the width
 the pavement they dash onward careless whom they may run against
or what mischief may ensue i would not continued dashall class
them with beasts burthen and confine them to the carriageway 
the street like other brutes that description but i would have them
placed under the control some salutary regulations and humanized
under the dread punishment
the squire coincided with his friend in opinion and added by way 
illustration that it was only a few days since he witnessed a serious
accident occasioned by the scandalous conduct a porter the fellow
bore on his shoulders a chest drawers a corner which while he
forced his way along the pavement struck a young lady a stunning blow
on the head bringing her violently to the ground and falling against a
shop window one her hands went through a pane glass by which she
was severely cut thus sustaining a double injury either which might
have been attended with fatal consequences
the three friends had now gained the fashionable lounge bondstreet
whence turning into conduitstreet they entered limmer's coffeehouse
for the purpose closing by refreshment the morning's excursion
here dashall recognized an old acquaintance in the person an
eminent physician who after an interchange civilities resumed his
attention to the daily journals
in the same box with this gentleman and directly opposite sat another
whose health was apparently on the decline who finding that the
ingenious physician had occasionally dropped into this coffeehouse had
placed himself visavis the doctor and made many indirect efforts
to withdraw his attention from the newspaper to examine the index his
the invalid's constitution he at last ventured a bold push at once
in the following terms doctor said he i have for a long time
been very far from being well and as i belong to an office where i am
obliged to attend everyday the complaints i have prove very troublesome
to me and i would be glad to remove them the doctor laid
down his paper and regarded his patient with a steady eye while he
proceeded i have but little appetite and digest what i eat very
poorly i have a strange swimming in my head c in short after
giving the doctor a full quarter an hour's detail all
his symptoms he concluded the state his case with a direct
question pray doctor what shall i take the doctor in the act
 resuming the newspaper gave him the following laconic
prescription take why take advice
this colloquy and its ludicrous result having been perfectly audible
to the company present afforded considerable entertainment which
the manoeuvring invalid seemed in no degree willing to partake for
he presently made his exit without even thanking the doctor for his
gratuitous advice
 limner's hotel this justly esteemed hotel was much
frequented by the late unfortunate lord camelford entering
the coffeeroom one evening meanly attired as he often
was he sat down to peruse the papers the day soon after
came in a dashing fellow a firstrate blood who threw
himself into the opposite seat the same box with lord c
and in a most consequential tone hallowed out waiter
bring in a pint madeira and a couple wax candles and
put them in the next box he then drew to him lord cs
candle and set himself to read his lordship glanced at him
a look indignation but exerting his optics a little
more continued to decipher his paper the waiter soon reappeared
and with a multitude obsequious bows announced
his having completed the commands the gentleman who
immediately lounged round into his box lord camelford
having finished his paragraph called out in a mimic tone to
that mr waiter bring me a pair snuffers
these were quickly brought when his lordship laid down his
paper walked round to the box in which mrwas snuffed
out both the candles and leisurely returned to his seat
boiling with rage and fury the indignant beau roared out
waiter waiter waiter who the devil is this fellow that
dares thus to insult a gentleman who is he what is he
what do they call him lord camelford sir said the
waiter who lord camelford returned the former in a
tone voice scarcely audible horrorstruck at the
recollection his own impertinence and almost doubting
whether he was still in existence lord camelford what
have i to pay on being told he laid down his score and
actually stole away without daring to taste his madeira
 the repast ended the friends separated sir felix to rejoin
his august relative at their lodgings and arrange with her preparations
for the entertainment tom and bob and these two gentlemen also
returning homewards to dress for the important occasion
passing the house his tailor the baronet stept in and desired mr
snip to send to his lodgings any time in the course the evening for
the last new suit for the purpose alteration as had been already
pointed out
miss macgilligan had preceded her nephew in reaching home and gave
him on his arrival an appropriate and edifying lecture on a threefold
subject embracing petulancy respect to superiors and veneration
for the memory our ancestors
the baronet who never designed seriously to insult his aunt but merely
to have a byeblow at her prominent foible pride descent listened
with becoming deference to her dissertation which was interrupted
by the entrance his servant the same who on a certain
occasion confided to mother cummings the safety his master's
property the tailor's boy sir felix for the new suit your honor
ordered to be altered very well rejoined sir felix sure enough
mr snip is prompt in observance instructions let the lad have
the suit immediately this business having been despatched miss
macgilligan was about to resume her admonitory discourse when luckily
the arrival the expected guests prevented its continuance and it was
consequently postponed until a more favourable opportunity
 vide page 
dinner was shortly announced during which nothing occurred 
particular import when the exhilarating tuscan grape had superseded
the discarded viands miss macgilligan mentioned that she had been
grossly imposed upon by the driver the hackneychariot it seems
that conceiving jehu was exacting more than his fare the lady
presenting a handful silver told him to take it all if he thought
proper and the conscientious knight the whip had actually embraced
the offer in its literal acceptation and pocketing the money made the
best his way before she recovered from the surprise occasioned by
this iniquitous transaction
 iniquitous repeated the baronet by the powers folly
but there was no advantage taken at all at all and the man must
have been worse than an idiot had he rejected so liberal an offer
gramachree he might cry and thanks to the donor such opportunities
don't occur every day
appealing to her guests she had the mortification finding the
opinion her nephew supported certainly madam said dashall the
conduct the man in putting a construction not meant upon your word
was highly reprehensible yet i am afraid that redress is unavailable
a gift was implied though obviously not intended but impartially
speaking you tendered a donation and the man if not morally right
was legally justifiable in accepting it
while this case was under discussion the baronet chuckled at the
mischance his aunt and in defiance the admonition given him a
few hours before seemed more petulant less respectful and totally
irreverent his ancestors
in the enjoyment this triumph and asserting that he could not be
takenin even by the most artfully conducted manoeuvre he was struck
dumb by the information that mr snip the tailor had called for the new
suit the devil fly over the hill howth with him exclaimed the
astounded sir felix with a secret foreboding evil has he not had
the new suit hours ago
he says not sir answered the servant
where then in the name mystery rejoined the baronet are the
clothes gone to they were sent by his boy were they not
he denies sir responded the servant that he sent for the clothes
at all at all
soul my grandmother send in this snip a tailor instantaneously
dashall immediately surmised a fraud and the statement snip
converted suspicion into fact
mr snip repeated that he had not sent for the clothes and neither
did he keep a boy but he recollected that there was a lad in his shop
purchasing some trifling article at the time sir felix gave his address
and ordered the new suit to be sent for and there is no doubt added
snip that this young adept being thus put in the way successfully
practising a fraud gladly availed himself the opportunity and
obtained possession the clothes in my name but sir felix continued
mr snip it must have escaped your recollection when you
sanctioned the delivery the clothes that i had particularly
cautioned you when you first honoured me with your custom against your
sending to my house any articles apparel by pretended messengers from
me unless on the authority my own hand writing
i exonerate you said the baronet from censure and exempt you from
loss i have been swindled there is now no remedy so make me another
suit and by stricter vigilance we shall endeavour to avoid future
depredation
 this is amongst the inferior classes fraud daily
practised in the metropolis the following is one a
must rate description
swindling a case most ingeniously contrived and
successfully carried into execution on saturday last is
scarcely to be equalled on the records fraud it was
equal to that practised on rundle and bridge the jewellers
some time ago but the present case is only at the expense
 four costly gold watches the swindler who called
himself mr winter is rather above the middle size was
dressed in a brown frock coat wears long whiskers and is
well calculated for imposition in address and manner a
house in southamptonstreet strand occupied by mr holt
the barrister having been advertised to be let mr winter
called about it several times last week and he appointed
saturday last to call with some ladies when he could give a
final answer and the servants were desired if the
occupants were from home to shew the gentleman and his
party into the diningroom having secured this point mr
winter called upon mr ely a jeweller at the latter 
the week and after looking over some trifles in the shop
he desired that some ladies watches might be brought to his
residence no southamptonstreet at a certain hour on
saturday for inspection the swindler called some time
before the jeweller was expected and inquired if the ladies
who were to meet him there had called and being informed in
the negative he affected surprise and desired them to be
informed his arrival when they came he was shewn into
the front drawingroom but he preferred the adjoining room
and desired the servant to shew a gentleman who would call
into the front room and let him know when he arrived the
jeweller was to his time with the goods and mr winter paid
him a visit and after looking over the goods he selected
four watches worth l to shew the ladies in the next
room instead which he took his hat and walked off with
the watches after waiting till out patience the
jeweller rang the bell and the servant missed mr winter
who had promised her servitude the landlord his new tenant
and the jeweller his watches
 it was now miss macgilligan's turn to triumph but to the
surprise and relief her nephew she did not avail herself the
privilege sensible perhaps that the loss which site sustained was
occasioned by her own imprudence and that his misfortune might have
happened to those even the most guarded against deception she consoled
instead recriminating the most perfect unanimity now prevailed
between the two relatives and the evening passed on with increased
pleasure the unexpected migration the new suit led to conversation
on the frauds london when dashall justly observed that if the
ingenuity exemplified in depredation was exercised in honest industry
in place being now the pest many those men might have been the
ornaments society
chapter xviii
tho village delights may charm for a time
with hunting with cricket with trapball and such
the rambles in london are bangup and prime
and never can tire or trouble us much
tis a life variety frolic and fun
rove which way you will right or left up or down
all night by the gas and all day by the sun
sure no joys can compare with the joys the town
 our two friends in consequence some allusions made by
the company at the finish on a preceding day to a house great
theatrical celebrity in drurylane resolved on a visit the following
evening and it may here be necessary to introduce such our readers
as are not in the secret to the same
the harp opposite drurylane theatre is well known as the resort
 theatrical amateurs and professors but those who have not had an
opportunity visiting its interior can scarcely form an idea 
the mirth wit and humour constantly displayed within its walls the
circumstance here alluded to though not exactly introduced in point 
time is one which generally takes place once in three years viz the
election a mayor to represent the now city washington an event
which is attended with as much bustle interest and whimsicality
as a popular election for a member parliament the generality the
persons who are frequent visitors to the house are termed harmonious 
and by due qualification become citizens washington although we
cannot give a true and circumstantial history this ancient city we
doubt not our numerous readers will discover that its title is derived
from an important article in life commonly called lush the four wards
are also appropriately titled as symbolical the effects which are
usually produced by its improper application on entering the room
the first corner on the right hand is suicide ward and derives its
appellation from a society so named in which each member is bound by an
oath that however he might feel inclined to lay violent hands upon his
glass he would not lay violent hands upon his own existence
 the left hand corner has also a name as appropriate as its
neighbour being called poverty ward so termed from its vicinity to
the door and the ease with which a citizen whose tanner casey and
toggery are out repair may make his entree and exit without
subjecting himself to the embarrassing gaze and scrutiny his more
fortunate fellowcitizens juniper ward which is directly opposite to
poverty ward may in a moral point view be said to mark the natural
gradation rom the one to the other whether these wards are so placed
by the moral considerations the ingenious citizens or not we are at
present unable to learn but we have discovered that juniper ward is
so called in consequence a club consisting seven citizens who
bound themselves to meet every evening exactly on the spot taking each
upon himself to defray the expense blue ruin for the whole party
on each evening alternately in the corner directly opposite to suicide
ward is lunatic ward indicative no doubt the few steps there are
between the one and the other hence the four corner pillars this
ancient and honourable city are replete with moral instruction to the
wise and discriminating part society
 tanner case a pocket
 toggery cloathing
each these wards like the wards the city london has
its alderman and no doubt can be entertained their being ably
represented as well as their rights and privileges being well secured
and sustained a gentleman who is well known and highly respected for
his abilities and attentions as theatrical agent which character he has
sustained for many years is high bailiff and at proper periods issues
his writ in the following form
city washington to wit
the high bailiff having received a requisition to convene a meeting for
the purpose nominating aldermen to represent the different wards and
from them to elect a mayor for the above city for the year ensuing
 the high bailiff in pursuance thereof fixes saturday the d
december inst to nominate for the purpose aforesaid and from thence
proceed to the election which election is to continue till the
following monday being the th when the poll is to be closed
given under my hand this th day december signed f
sims high bailiff
washington hall
the election to commence at o'clock the poll to be closed at
halfpast 
after this official notice preparations are made in due form for the
election and in the fitting up the hustings the most skilful
and ingenious artists are selected from the several wards while the
candidates are employed in forming their committees and canvassing
their friends and fellowcitizens each them professing an intention
to intersect the city with canals sky blue to reduce the price 
heavy wet and to cultivate plantations the weed to be given away
for the benefit and advantage the community thereby to render
taxation useless and the comforts life compatible by all ranks and
degrees society to take the burthensome load civic state upon
themselves in order that their friends and neighbours may be free that
independence may become universal and that the suffrages the people
may be beyond controul nor can it be doubted but these professions
are made with as much sincerity in many a similar nature in larger
cities and in situations much greater importance
for quacks profess the nation's ills to cure
to mend small fortunes and set up the poor
and oft times neatly make their projects known
by mending not the public's but their own
the poor indeed may prove their watchful cares
that nicely sift and weigh their mean affairs
from scanty earnings nibbling portions small
as mice by bits steal cheese with rind and all
but why should statesmen for mechanics carve
what are they fit for but to work and starve
it is however proper to observe that in the city washington there
are no sinecures no placemen and pensioners to exhaust the treasury
honour is the grand inducement for the acceptance office and highly
honour'd are those who are fortunate enough to obtain the mark s 
distinction to which they aspire
 the oath administered upon such occasions is a most serious
and solemn nature which however notwithstanding the conscientious
scruples the voters must be taken with suitable gravity before they
can be permitted to poll being in substance nearly as follows
i a b do swear that i have been an inhabitant the city 
washington for the space years and that i have taken within its
walls pots porter glasses jacket and smoked pipes the
blanks are filled in according to circumstances that is to say one
pot heavy wet one glass juniper and one loading weed at
least annually have been the cause such acts in others or have been
present when such acts have been performed and that i have not polled
at this election
this oath is sworn with all due solemnity by kissing the foot a
broken glass and the vote is then recorded
tom and bob who had so little previous intimation this important
event were informed as they proceeded to the scene action by
a friend one the candidates that the election was strongly
contested between sir william sims the son the worthy high bailiff
sir benjamin rosebud jessamine sweetbread sir peter paid and
peregrine foxall the silvertoned orator strongly supported by the tag
rag and bobtail club sir frederick atkinson introduced and proposed by
the marquis huntley a well known sporting character from the county
 surrey and mr alderman whitman washington notoriety the door
 the house was well guarded by the posse comitatus armed with staves
emblematical the renowned city to which they belonged and decorated
with the favors the different candidates by whom they were employed
or whose interest they espoused the staves instead the crown were
surmounted by quartern measures and produced a most striking and novel
effect as they appeared to be more reverenced and respected than that
gaudy bauble which is a representative royalty
at the moment our friends entrance large bodies voters were
brought up by canvassing parties from the surrounding habitations with
colours flying and were introduced in succession to poll and as time
was fast escaping every one was active in support his favourite
candidate all was bustle and anxiety and tom and bob approached the
hustings with two chimneysweepers a hackneycoachman and three light
bearers alias linkcarriers from covent garden theatre having polled
for sir william sims who very politely returned thanks for 
the honour conferred on him standing room was provided for them by the
inhabitants lunatic ward who it should seem like others under the
influence the moon have their lucid intervals and who upon this
occasion displayed a more than usual portion sanity mingled with
good humour and humanity
in this quarter the city where our friends expected to find
distracted or at least abstracted intellect they were very pleasingly
disappointed at discovering they were associated with reasonable and
intelligent beings although some them fatigued by their exertions
during the election were so strongly attacked by somnus that
notwithstanding the bustle with which they were surrounded they
occasionally dropped into the arms the drowsy god and accompanied
the proceedings with a snore till again roused to light and life by
some more wakeful inhabitant
at the appointed time the high bailiff announced the election closed
and after an examination the votes declared the choice to have
fallen on sir william a circumstance which drew forth a unanimous
burst approbation long loud and deep which in a few moments being
communicated to those without this was as cordially and as vociferously
answered by anxious and admiring crowds
the influx citizens upon the event being known to hear the speeches
 the different candidates choaked up every avenue to the hustings
and beggars all description the inimitable pencil a hogarth could
hardly have done justice to the scene and a common hall the city 
london might be considered a common fool to it every voter had a right
established that right and enjoyed it here stood the welldressed
corinthian in his bangup toggery alongside a man in armour one
 the braziers company armed with a potlid and a spit and decorated
with a jackchain round his neck there stood a controller the prays
a jarvey in close conversation with one the lighters the world
with his torch in hand a flue maker in one corner was endeavouring
to explain a distinction between smoke and gas to a lamplighter who
declared it as his opinion that the city washington at all times
a luminous and deservedly revered city had had more light thrown upon
it that election by the introduction the link carriers than it ever
had before and likewise that his dissertation on smoke and gas was not
worth one puff from his pipe
 in the midst this bustle noise and confusion it was sometime
before the high bailiff could obtain silence when sir william
made his appearance on the hustings and in language well suited for the
occasion declared the heartfelt gratitude he entertained for the high
and distinguished honour so handsomely conferred upon him with
his determination never to lose sight the invaluable rights and
privileges his constituents assuring them they were welcome
to indulge themselves with any thing the house afforded he next
complimented his opponents on the very gentlemanlike way in which
the election had been conducted and alluded most emphatically to the
introduction those voters who endeavour to lighten the darkness
 the world the linkcarriers who by their manners and conduct had
become on that occasion as it were links a chain which in point 
friendship good humour and independence he sincerely hoped would
never be broken rapturous applause followed this speech which
notwithstanding the almost overpowering load gratitude with which the
speaker was burthened was given with good emphasis and corresponding
effect
the other candidates returned thanks to those their fellowcitizens
who had supported their interest and no one seeming inclined to call
for a scrutiny sir william took the official oath and was invested
with the cloathing magistracy which being done mr alderman whitman
arose to address the mayor
the well known ability usually displayed by this gentleman his
patriotic zeal and undeviating integrity commanded immediate silence
while he informed the chief magistrate a circumstance which had
recently occurred and which left one the wards unrepresented by a
worthy alderman who in consequence accepting an office in the
board controul had by the laws washington vacated his seat an
explanation being demanded it appeared that the worthy alderman had
become a deputy manager a country theatre and consequently must be
considered under the board controul it was therefore necessary he
should at least be reelected before he could be allowed to continue in
the distinguished station alderman this point being agreed to the
situation was declared vacant and a time appointed for the election
 the official business the election being over harmony and
conviviality became the order the night foaming bowls and flowing
glasses decorated the tables many the citizens withdrawing to rest
after their labours made room for those who remained and every one
seemed desirous to
wreath the bowl
with flowers soul
the brightest wit can find us
we'll take a flight
towards heav'n tonight
and leave dull earth behind us
the song the toast the sentiment followed each other in rapid
succession mirth and good humour prevailed and time while he
exhausted himself appeared to be inexhaustible the beams wit
the lively sallies humour and the interchange good fellowship
eradicated the glass in its circulation and doubly enhanced its
contents and in amusements so truly congenial with the disposition 
the hon tom dashall and his cousin they joined till after four o'clock
in the morning thus rendering themselves true and devoted citizens 
washington when they sallied forth tolerably well primed for any lark
or spree which chance might throw in their way it was a fine morning
and while the shopkeepers and tradesmen were taking their rest the
market gardeners and others were directing their waggons and carts to
covent garden
now said the hon tom dashall we will just take a turn round the
garden and a stroll down drurylane for a walk will do us no harm
after our night's amusement and we can hardly fail to find subjects
worthy observation though in all probability we are too early to
realize all the poet's description a market
a market's the circle for frolic and glee
where tastes all kinds may be suited
the dasher the quiz and the up to all he
pluck sprees from the plants in it rooted
if the joker or queer one would fain learn a place
where they'd wish for a morning to lark it
they need go no further than just shew their face
in that region mirth a large market
 the streets that surround the theatres and which an evening
are thronged with the elegant equipage the visitors were now filled
with carts waggons and other vehicles various denominations for
conveyance the marketable commodities to and from the place sale
here and there were groupes irishmen and basketwomen endeavouring
to obtain a load and squabbling with assiduous vociferations for the
first call
this said tom is the largest market for vegetables we have in the
metropolis and supplies numerous retail dealers with their stock in
trade who assemble here early in the morning to make their bargains
and get them home before the more important business the day that
 selling commences while tom was explaining thus briefly to his
cousin aloud laugh attracted their attention and drew them to a part
 the market where a crowd was collected to witness a squabble between
a jew orange merchant and a pork butcher
 although the hon tom dashall hurried his cousin from the
scene altercation at the time its occurrence they
enjoyed a hearty laugh at the following report the facts
which appeared in one the morning papers shortly
afterwards
ephraim versus stewart
this was a proceeding in limine by which the plain till
sought reparation for violence done to his religious
scruples and bodily health by the defendant inasmuch as he
the plaintiff being a jew on wednesday the th day 
this month in the forenoon in the parish st paul
covent garden did with malice aforethought knock him down
with a pig's head contrary to the statute and against the
peace our sovereign lord the king c
both plaintiff and defendant pleaded each for himself no
counsel being employed on either side
ephraim ephraim deposed that he is by profession an orangemerchant
carrying on his business in covent garden market
that the defendant richard stewart is a dealer in pork and
poultry in the said market and that he the said richard
stewart on the day and time then stated did thrust a pig's
face against his cheek with such violence as to throw him
backwards into a chest oranges whereby he sustained
great damage both in body mind and merchandize plaintiff
stated moreover that he had previously and on sundry
occasions forewarned the said richard stewart it was
contrary to the tenets his religion to come in contact
with pork and yet nevertheless he the said richard did
frequently and from time to time intrude pork upon his
attention by holding it up aloft in the market and
exclaiming aloud ephraim will you have a mouthful all
this he humbly submitted betokened great malice and
wickedness in the said richard and he therefore besought
the magistrate to interpose the protection the law in his
behalf
the magistrate observed that he was astonished a person 
mr stewart's appearance and respectability should be guilty
 such conduct and having explained to him that the law
afforded equal protection to the professors every
religion called upon him for his defence
may it please your worship said mr richard stewart who
is a well fed man a jolly and pleasing countenance
may it please your worship i keeps a shop in covent garden
market and have done so any time these ten years and mr
ephraim's stand is next to mine now your worship on
wednesday morning i'd a hamper o'pork sent up out
hertfordshire and so i opened the hamper and at the top
 it lay a nice head and i takes it and holds it up and
says i heres a bountiful head says i did ever any body see
such a handsome un and sure enough your worship it was the
most bootiftd as ever was and would a done any body's heart
good to see it it was cut so clean the quarter drawing
his finger closely across his own neck and was so short
i'the snout and as white as a sheet it was your worship
remarkably handsome and so i said says i look here did
ever tiny body see such a picture holding it up just in
this manner with that ah says mr ephraim says he now
my dream's out i dreamt last night that i saw two pig's
heads together and there they are meaning my head and
the pig's head your worship well i took no notice o'that
but i goes me gently behind him and slides the pig's head
by the side his head claps my own o the other side all
on a row with the pig's in the middle your worship and
says i to the folks says i now who'll say which is the
honestest face the three with that your worship all
the folks fell a laughing and i goes myself quietly back
again to a stall but poor ephraim he fell in such a
passion lord lord to see what a pucker he were in he
danced and he capered and he rubbed his whiskers though i
verily believe the pig's head never touched him and he
jumped and he fidgeted about all as one as if he was mad
till at last he tumbled into the orange chest your worship
 his own accord as it were and that's the long and the
short it your worship as my neighbours here can
specify
his worship having listened attentively to those
conflicting statements decided that the defendant had acted
indecently in insulting the religious feelings the
plaintiff though at the same time the affair was hardly
worth carrying to the sessions and therefore he would
recommend the plaintiff to be satisfied with an apology
the defendant expressed the greatest willingness to
apologize for says he i have axed another jew what
could make mr ephraim in such a passion and he told me
your worship that if you get a rale jew and rub him with a
bit o'pork it's the greatest crime as ever was
plaintiff and defendant then retired and the
matter was compromised
 the israelite appeared to be in a great rage swore he
would have revenge his insulting neighbour and pull him up the
exasperation the jew afforded much merriment to the spectators who
seemed to enjoy his aggravation our friends however had arrived
too late to discover the cause and although not very particular about
discovering themselves amid the mob conceived it most prudent to move
onward without inquiry for as tom observed if we ask any questions
we are sure to be told lies they then passed through the market made
their way up jamesstreet to long acre and thence to drurylane
illustration pagejpg drury lane
the watchmen were just leaving their stations with an intention to
partake what they had all night been endeavouring to deprive others
and the humbler ranks society were preparing for the business the
day while the batter'd beau the clean'd out buck and the dissipated
voluptuary were occasionally to be seen gliding from holes and corners
and scampering home with less wisdom in their heads and less money in
their purses than when they left here was to be seen the city showman
hastening away from his dulcinea to get down his master's shutters
before the gouty old gentleman should be able to crawl down stairs
there the dandy half dressed and more than half seas over buttoning
his toggery close round him to keep out the damp air the morning
affecting to sing
be gone dull care
slipped along as he supposed unobserved between duster scavengers
fluefakers gardeners fishfags and bricklayer's labourers to refit
and put himself in a situation to recount the adventures the night
at one door stood a shivering group halfstarved chimneysweepers
rending the air with their piercing cries sweep occasionally
relieved by a few hearty dns bestowed upon the servant that she
did not come down in order to let a diminutive urchin yet up the flue
leaning against a post at the corner the street was an overdone
irishman making a bargain with pugnosed peg a sort halfbred
pinafore cyprian whose disappointments during the night induced her to
try at obtaining a morning customer the hibernian was relating the ill
usage he had been subjected to and the necessity he had making a
hasty retreat from the quarters he had taken up while bet brill on
her road to billingsgate was blowing him up for wearing odd boots and
being a hod man blowing a cloud sufficient to enliven and revive the
whole party
 poor fellow said tom it would be a charity to pop him into
a rattler and drive him home and do you see he is standing close to
a mud cart the delicate drippings which are gently replenishing his
otherwise empty pockets
be aise said pat murphy the hodman ain't he an irish gentleman
ain't i a gentleman from ireland and ain't it lit and proper and
right and just as well as gentlemanly that two gentlemen should go
together so come along peg we'll just take a taste the cratur
drink success to the lads shelley and put the matter in its right
shape with this pugnosed peg seized him by one arm and the last
orator by the other and in a short time they entered a sluice in the
neighbourhood which enclosed the party from view
turning from the group which they had been paying attention to they
were suddenly attracted by a female purveyor for the stomach who was
serving out her tea coffee and saloop from a boiling cauldron and
handing with due complaisance to her customers bread and butter which
was as eagerly swallowed and devoured by two duster who appeared to
relish their delicate meal with as much appetite and gout as the
pampered palate a city alderman would a plate turtle the figure
 the lady whose commodities were thus desirable and refreshing to the
hungry dustcollectors struck bob at the first view as having something
matronly and kind about it
these persons said tom are really useful in their vocation and
while they provide a wholesome beverage for the industrious are rather
deserving approbation than censure or molestation the latter
however they are frequently subjected to for the kids lark in
their moments revelry think lightly such poor people's stock in
trade and consider it a prime spree to upset the whole concern
without caring who may be scalded by the downfall or how many their
fellowcreatures may go without a breakfast and dinner in consequence
but do you mark the other woman behind her
i do said bob and it is impossible to view them both without
noticing the striking contrast they form to each other
 your observations are just continued tom that is an old
beldame the neighbourhood in search the poor unhappy girl who has
just taken the irishman in tow an encourager all that is vicious and
baneful in society
i could almost judge that from her features replied bob though i do
not pretend to much skill in physiognomy
a debauched body and a vitiated mind are perceptible in her face and
having remained on the town till these were too visible for her to hope
for a continuance she is now a tutoress others to make the most 
those with whom they promiscuously associate she furnishes the finery
and shares the plunder it is however a melancholy and disgusting
picture real life in london and merely deserves to be known in order
to be avoided for there is no species villainy to which persons 
her stamp
 whom it is to be hoped there are but few cried tallyhoho
interrupting him
for the sake human nature replied shalt it is to be hoped so
but there is no species villainy to which they will not stoop 
 the hon tom dashall's observations on this subject are
but too strikingly exemplified by a case heard at worshipstreet
police office a short time back in which jemima
matthews was charged with conduct which excited astonishment
at the depravity human nature one the parish
constables spitalfields stated he proceeded to the
residence the prisoner in upper catostreet and found
the wretch at the bar surrounded by eight children while a
supper consisting a variety meats and vegetables was
making ready on the fire three children frederick clark
john clark and john bailey were owned by their parents
the children seemed so much under the controul this
infamous woman that they were afraid to tell the truth
until she was removed from the bar little bailey then said
they were daily sent out to steal what they could and bring
it home in the evening when they could get nothing else
they stole meat from the butchers and vegetables from the
greengrocers the woman kept a pack cards by which she
told their fortunes whether they would succeed or be
caught by the officers mr sway observed that since he
had attended the office he never witnessed a case so
much iniquity the prisoner was remanded for further
examination and the magistrate intimated he should desire
the parish to prosecute her for the misdemeanor in exciting
these children to commit felonies
 at this moment their attention was suddenly called to another
subject by a loud huzza from a combination voices at no great
distance from where they then were and in a few minutes a considerable
concourse duster and others appeared in view
there is something in the wind said dashall we must have a look at
these gentry for there is frequently some humour among them
i hope replied bob they have not overturned the dustcart in the
wind for i am apprehensive in such a case we should scarcely have eyes
to view their frolics
tom laughed at the ready turn his cousin and remarking that all
flesh was dust proceeded towards the increasing party here they soon
found out that as a venerable son the fantailedhat fraternity
described it a screw was loose
perhaps inquired bob it is the inchpin why aye mayhap as how
that there may be the case for aught i knows about it howsomever i'll
tell you all about it first and foremost you must know that dick nobs
lives down here in charlesstreet and dick nobs has got a wife now
she is the devil's own darling and dick is a match for her or the devil
himself come from wherever he may but as good a fellow as ever lapped
up a pail full watergruel and so you must know as how dick has this
here very morning been found out in bed with another man's wife the
other man is a nightman and rubbishcarter what lives in the same
house with dick so this here man being out all night at a job dick
gets lusty and so help me he finds his way steady enough into
that there man's bed and when that there man comes home my eyes what a
blow up there lays dick nobs fast asleep in the man's wife's arms so
he kicks up a row dick shews fight and the man comes and tells us all
about it so we are going to try him for a misdemeanor and he can't
help himself no how whatsomedever
tom was alive to the story and in a few minutes the culprit was
conducted to a neighbouring publichouse tried before a whole bench 
the society cast and condemned to undergo the usual sentence in
such cases made and provided entitled burning shame and active
preparations were making by those the fraternity without to carry
into immediate execution the sentence pronounced by those within
 the offender was decorated with a bunch christmas in his
hat and two large carrots in the front to represent horns in this
manner he was mounted on the brawny shoulders four his companions
preceded by the crier the court another fustian with a bell which
he rung lustily and at intervals proclaimed the crime which the
culprit had been found guilty after the crier followed eight more
 the brotherhood two and two their hats ornamented with bunches
 holly and a burning candle in the front each hat then came the
culprit carried as already described with a pot heavy wet in one
hand and a pipe tobacco in the other which he occasionally smoaked
stooping forward to light it at one the candles in the fantail hats
 his two front supporters the rear this ludicrous procession was
brought up by several other duster and coalheavers and their ladies
the procession set out from charlesstreet down drurylane great
queenstreet wildstreet and round clare market followed by an
immense crowd which kept increasing as they went and nearly rendered
the streets impassable two collectors were appointed one on each side
 the street and were very active in levying contributions among
the spectators to defray the expenses they stopped at several
publichouses where they quaffed off oceans heavy wet and numerous
streamlets old jamaica and then returned to headquarters in
charlesstreet where the offence was drowned in drink and they and
their ladies passed the remainder the evening as happy as beer and
gin rum and tobacco could make them
having witnessed a considerable part this ceremonious proceeding
and been informed the intended finale our friends who began to
feel somewhat uncomfortable for want refreshment and rest proposed
returning home and having thrown themselves into a hack they in a
short time arrived at piccadilly
chapter xix
if in real life's chapter you e'er tinct a blank
tis yourself and you only you justly can thank
for to him who is willing there's no need to stand
since enough may be found twixt mile and the strand
to instruct to inform to disgust or invite
to deplore to respect to regret or delight
tis in london where unceasing novelty grows
always fresh and in bloom like the opening rose
but if to the rose we its sweetness compare
fis as freely confess'd many thorns gather there
and if to avoid the latter you're prone
tis at least quite as well where they are should be known
 the arrival at piccadilly turned out to be truly agreeable
to our friends who were scarcely dressed and seated at the
breakfasttable before they were surprised by the unexpected appearance
 an old friend whose company and conversation had upon many occasions
afforded them so much pleasure and information this was no other than
sparkle
my dear boy said the hon tom dashall you are welcome to the scene
 former gratifications how is your better half and all friends in
the country any increase in the family why you look as healthy as
hygeia and as steady as old time
i confess replied sparkle you ask so many questions upon important
subjects in one breath that i am quite deficient wind to answer them
seriatim you must therefore take an answer in two words all's right
enough replied tom then i am content but how what are you in
town alone
you shall know all in time but don't drive on too hard i am glad to
meet you again in the regions fun frolic and humour which i
doubt not there is as there always was a plentiful stock glad to see
you both in good health and tiptop spirits i have only come to passa
fortnight with you and as i intend to make the utmost use every
minute the time don't let us waste in empty words what would be
better employed in useful deeds
 useful deeds reechoed tom useful deeds that savours 
reflection i thought you were fully aware it is an article considered
 little value in the labyrinths london but since you are become
as i may venture to presume a useful man what may be the objects upon
which you propose to practise your utility
still the same i find tom all life spirit and gaiety nothing like
a hit and i suppose you now think you have a palpable one never mind
i am not easily disconcerted therefore you may play off the artillery
 your wit without much chance obtaining a triumph but however in
plain words i expect to be a happy father in about another month
o ho said tom then you are really a useful member society and
i suppose are merely come up to town for the purpose picking up a
little more useful information and instruction how to perform the part
 papa
nay replied sparkle i could hardly expect to obtain such from you
i must therefore be excused and acquitted all such intentions but
joking apart how are you devoted
to you replied tallyhoho who was much pleased by this accession to
their society
then continued sparkle lend me all the assistance in your power
when did you see our old friend merrywell
the last time i saw him was in a place safety studying the law and
taking lessons from its professors in the priory
we must find him replied sparkle so if you are not engaged come
along and i will relate the circumstances which induce this search as
we proceed
to this proposal tom and bob readily acceding the party were quickly on
their way towards abbot's park
 you must know said sparkle that merry well's uncle in
the country having received some information upon the subject his
confinement probably very highly coloured has since his release
withdrawn his patronage and support so that the poor fellow has been
without supplies for some time past and i am at a loss to conjecture
by what means he is now working the oracle for a subsistence his uncle
however is in the last stage a severe illness with little chance
 recovery and as i apprehend there is but little time to spare i
intend if possible to find our old acquaintance start him for his
relative's residence in hope that he may arrive in time to be in at the
death and become inheritor his estate which is considerable and
may otherwise be apportioned among persons for whom he has had but
little or no regard while living
the object in view is a good one said dashall and i sincerely hope
we shall succeed in our endeavours
passing down st james'sstreet sparkle was quickly recognized by many
 his old acquaintances and friends and congratulated upon his return
to the scenes where they had in company with him enjoyed many a lark
and invitations came in as fast upon nim as the moments life were
fleeting away for the present however all engagements were
declined till the principal object his journey to london should be
accomplished and after inquiries about old friends and observations
upon the passing occurrences the moment were over they proceeded on
their way westminster bridge was the precise line direction for them
to pursue and as fortune would have it they had scarcely arrived at
the foot it before they discovered merrywell bustling along in
an opposite direction he however appeared rather inclined to pass
without recognition or acknowledgment when sparkle turning close upon
him gave him a hearty tap on the shoulder which made him as it were
involuntarily turn his head
well met said sparkle i want you
at whose suit sir was the immediate inquiry
to suit yourself was a reply as quickly given
zounds said merrywell i had little idea being tapped on the
shoulder by an old friend but are you indeed in earnest
certainly i am and can't be refused but if you should be pinched
for bail i think i have two friends with me who will do the needful
introducing tom and bob
i see how it is continued merrywell and have no objection to a
joke but i can't bear to have it carried too far how d'ye do how
d'ye do can't stop in a devil a hurry full business
 zounds said tom you are almost as bad as the man who
having married a wife could not come but if i may be so bold whither
away so fast
to westminster hall the sessions is on must go law is like the tide
it stays for none adieu
we cannot part thus said sparkle i have come some miles in search
 you and cannot afford to be played with now
then accompany me to westminster hall and i will be at your service
if not replied sparkle i shall enter a special detainer against
you so come along
they now entered westminster hall where merry well having disposed 
some briefs and other papers into the hands a counsellor preparatory
to a cause coming on
there continued he now i am at your service
then tell me said sparkle what you are at
first inquired merry well let me know what is your object in asking
such a question
this being briefly explained together with the absolute necessity there
was for his leaving town without delay
now said he i am at liberty to give you a sketch circumstances
which have befallen me since i saw you last
come then said dashall we will proceed to piccadilly spend a
comfortable afternoon and ship you off by the mail from the white horse
cellar at eight o'clock
with all my heart was the reply well now you must understand i ama
sort dabbler in professions i was liberated from the high wall
 the priory by the insolvent debtor's act and since the unfortunate
representation to the old boy which deprived me the needful
supplies i have tried my hand in three different ways
and which are they
love law and literature continued merry well
a very pretty combination said dashall and are you able to make
them blend comfortably together
 nothing more easy in the world in the first place a lady has
taken a fancy to me which fancy i am willing to indulge in return for
which she provides me with every indulgence i profess to be principal
in the office a lawyer established practice who suffers me to
share in the profits such business as i can obtain in the way 
literature i have as yet done but little though i am encouraged to hope
much from the success others indeed i am told if i can but write
libels for john bull i may make a rapid fortune
and when so made said sparkle i shall wish you well with it but i
think the speculation i have already named much more likely to turn out
equal to your wishes and more consonant with your feelings than the
pursuit either those you have mentioned
there i agree perfectly with you and if i can make all right with the
old gentleman a fig for all the rest my occupations but you know i
always liked independence and if i could not get a fortune ready made
i had a desire to be the architect one i should raise for myself
why i know you have generally borne the character a man genius
yes and a deal my character did for me after quitting the walls why
man i happened to hear a vacancy in a city parish school for which
i ventured to conceive myself duly qualified and therefore determined
to make application to the churchwardens one whom had the character
 being a man great power and was said to be the first in his line
in the three kingdoms away i posted full hope and expectation
 becoming a second caleb quoted not doubting but salary and
circumstances would turn out exactly to my wish
but i thought you liked independence said tallyhoho
rather too much to engage in that concern was the reply as you will
hear presently upon tracing out this gentleman who bore so strong a
recommendation to particular notice you may guess my surprise upon
finding purveyor sausages in gold letters over his door
dashall burst into an irresistible laugh and was most cordially joined
by sparkle and tallyhoho who were now strongly interested in the result
 merrywell's account
when i arrived continued merry well this patron was reading the
newspaper which he threw down immediately upon my entrance having
mistaken me for a customer
 servant sir said he pulling down his greasy
waistcoat i am come sir said i to make some inquiry
concerning a vacant schoolmastership oh there again resumed the
sausagemaking churchwarden vy you are the seventeenth fellow that
has been here today a bothering me about this plaguy vacancy how do
you read you'll have a trial before me and my brother representative 
this parish and my spouse will also attend the reading bouts now if
so be as you minds your hits why then may be you'll be the domini but
mind you i don't like your sonorous voices and my spouse she knows
things quite as well as i do she wants a great deal action so
only you mind loud and sonorous and plenty muscular motion for my
spouse that's the way to win but i haven't any time to talk to you
now you must call an evening when i am more at leisure and then
i'll explain so move off now sir move off for i sees a customer
coming servant maun flesh and blood could bear no more and
so so what said sparkle did you knock him down in the midst
 his own sausages
no no i knew too much the law for that but i cut the
churchwarden and bolted from the sausageshop determined to embrace
law physic or divinity in preference to cutting
the rumps
 little schoolboy jackie
the study the law was rather compulsory than voluntary for during
my residence in the college i was under the necessity devoting some
part my time to though i felt no great partiality for it and you
know law is law and as in such and so forth and hereby and aforesaid
provided always nevertheless notwithstanding law is like a country
dance people are led up and down in it till they are tired law is like
a surgery there are a great many terrible cases in it it is
also like physic they that take least it are best off law is like
a homely gentlewoman very well to follow law is like a scolding wife
very bad when it follows us law is like a new fashion people are
bewitched to get into it it is also like bad weather most people are
glad when they get out it
 i believe that sincerely cried the hon tom dashall for i
think there are instances enough in which law has nothing at all to do
with justice
 this remark the hon tom dashall is admirably
illustrated by the following statement
twelve people in one bail bond fob ten pounds there
are very few instances delinquency which we have
stated that will stagger the belief the fair
practitioner because they know such transactions are
possible their only surprise is the impunity with which
they are committed mixed with some regret that the
profession is so contaminated the species peculation
we have now to submit to our readers is singular nature
for we know not whether folly impudence or infamy has the
greater share in the transaction we will therefore leave
our readers to judge as to the statement the fact it
is impossible we can err as we were concerned for the
defendants and the case singular as it is was literally
and accurately thus one those unfortunate females who
contribute to the existence a miscreant crew bawds
milliners hairdressers tallywomen and many other
reptiles the same class was arrested for ten pounds at
the house the celebrated or more properly speaking
the notorious mrs johnson jermynstreet the
attorney accompanied the officer and it happened that a
young gentleman connected with a bankinghouse great
respectability was present whom the attorney directed to
take in a bail bond with the ladyabbess herself but as
they were not sufficiently responsible ten more the
cyprian tribe all nuns the same convent were likewise
required to execute this bond course they complied
the attorney after having made the parties acquainted
with the great favour he had shewn them and the vast
responsibility he had taken upon himself required no more
than two guineas for the officer and himself telling them
he would give them information when any thing further was to
be done instead which he took an assignment sued out
process prepared declarations and served the parties
the gentleman rather alarmed at the idea the
circumstance being known desired us to pay the debt and
costs for that purpose we applied to the attorney and to
our astonishment we were informed that the costs amounted to
thirty pounds for that there were twelve defendants the
reader cannot suppose that any thing further could pass upon
such a preposterous subject than giving notice an
application to the court to set aside the proceedings on
our return home we found eleven the defendants
consisting the old brood hen and her chickens each with
a copy the process in her hand the business now most
certainly put on the appearance some costs we again
applied to the attorney and by way cutting it short
offered him five pounds but he like many others who rely
on the integrity and propriety their practice disdained
a compromise or abridgement his lawful fees and he was
hardy enough to suffer the application it is almost
needless to say the proceedings were set aside we have
forebode to mention the name the attorney on account 
the misery in which this dreadful transaction has involved
him a misery which amply atones for his offences and
deprives him the power ever offending again as an
attorney far be it from us then to sink him deeper in the
gulph wretchedness we kick not the dead lion it is
athletic triumphant villany against which we wage war
 by this time they were arrived in piccadilly where they sat
down to a cheerful refreshment and proceeded to make arrangements
for merry well's departure previous to this however dashall and his
cousin had an engagement to keep with their hibernian friends which
particulars will appear in the next chapter
chapter xx
all hail to the day the tutelar saint
old george not the king but the prince brave fellows
and champion england by providence sent
to slay a fierce dragon as histories tell us
and hail to the king the first isle on earth
his fame with st george and the dragon who blending
has chosen to celebrate this as his birth
the day all others good fortune portending
away then with care let us haste to the park
where buckinghamhouse will exhibit a levy
resplendent in rank youth and beauty and hark
hoarse cannon announce both the birthday and levee
reverberate then in each seaport the roar
and wave england's standard on high from each steeple
and skip from the oiling each ship to the shore
and joyfully dance on dry land with the people
 that we may not be accused plagiarism we acknowledge
ourselves indebted for the hyperbole contained in the last
two lines these introductory stanzas to an original
recommendation for a proper display rapture as
contained in the following couplet by one peter er wherein
he very humanely invites all the vessels belonging to great
britain to strand themselves out joy for the accession 
james i
let subjects sing bells ring and cannons roar
and every ship come dancing to the shore
the morning st george's day was ushered in as the
appointed anniversary his majesty's birth by all the
churchbells the metropolis the waving the royal
standard from the steeples the display the colours 
all nations by the vessels in the thames and cumberland
mentions in his memoirs that when his father the bishop
revisited his estate in ireland an affectionate rustic hit
upon an ingenious mode shewing his happiness by leaping
from a tree and breaking his leg we do not find that any
 his majesty's loving subjects in the park on st george's
day followed the example the irish rustic
illustration pagejpg st george's day
other manifestations affection by a grateful people to the best 
sovereigns
the sky was overcast the morning lower'd
and heavily in clouds brought on the day
 but despite wind or wet female curiosity must be gratified
miss judith macgilligan had some time previous to this auspicious
day expressed a desire to witness the gay and brilliant assemblage
 company in progress to the levee and tom and bob having gallantly
volunteered their services on this important occasion they now sallied
forth just as the park and tower guns were thundering the announcement
 festivity and joining sir felix o'o'grady and his aunt at their
lodgings the party immediately moved onward to the scene action
already had royalty taken wing and dignified with his presence the late
maternal palace before our pedestrians reached the park to the great
disappointment miss macgilligan who however consoled herself with
the hope being able to obtain a glimpse monarchy as his majesty
passed on his return to carltonhouse
the baronet in the meanwhile was in a reverie which at last broke out
in the following rhapsody
oh blest occasion dispensing good
how seldom used how little understood
to nurse with tender care the thriving arts
watch every beam philosophy imparts
to give religion her unbridled scope
nor judge by statute a believer's hope
with close fidelity and love unfeign'd
to keep the matrimonial bond unstain'd
covetous only a virtuous praise
his life a lesson to the land he sways
blest country where these kingly glories shine
blest england if this happiness be thine
but
if smiling peeresses and simp'ring peers
encompassing his throne a few short years
if the gilt carriage and the pamper'd steed
that wants no driving and disdains the lead
if guards mechanically form'd in ranks
playing at beat drum their martial pranks
shouldering and standing as if stuck to stone
while condescending majesty looks on
if monarchy consists in such base things
sighing i say again i pity kings
 an immense number splendid carriages now presented
themselves to view in continued and uninterrupted succession
stretching from the horse guards the whole length the mall to
buckinghamhouse where each setting down and thence taking up a
position in the birdcage walk they formed a circle nearly two
miles and exhibited in the magnificence the vehicles the admirable
symmetry the horses and rich liveries the attendants a scene 
interest matchless perhaps by any other metropolis in the universe
skirting the indeterminable line carriages that slowly and under
frequent stoppages proceeded to the goal attraction our party
penetrated at last the dense mass spectators and gaining
a favourable post observation took a position adjacent to
buckinghamhouse where the band music the foot guards within
and that the horse guards without the ironrailing circumscribing the
palace alternately enlivened the scene with concord sweet sounds
but the great and general object attention was that female
loveliness occupying almost every passing vehicle dashall remarked
that he had never before been gratified with such an extensive and
captivating display sir felix and the squire were in raptures and even
the primitive austerity miss macgilligan yielded to the influence 
beauty and acknowledging its predominancy she at same time observed
that its fascination was enhanced by the dress the ladies which
though splendid exhibited genuine taste and was more remarkable for
its uniform adherence to modesty than she had hitherto seen it on any
similar occasionally
 we are not fastidious neither would we wish the charms 
youth and beauty inaccessible to admiration but certainly
the dress or rather undress our fair countrywomen has
 late years bordered closely on nudity female delicacy
is powerfully attractive we were glad to observe its
predominancy at the last levee and we trust that it will
gain universal prevalence edit
 dashall whose place would more properly have been in the
circle within the palace than amongst the spectators without was
frequently saluted by the passing company and when the fair hand
 beauty waved gracefully towards him sir felix felt happy in
the friendship and society a gentleman thus honoured with such
distinguished recognition and in the warmth his feelings exclaimed
aloud that by the immortal powers were he king england he would
be more proud the irradiating charms these celestial visitors
than in the diadem royalty and extension empire this remark was
universally acquiesced in and most cordially so by a group lively
girls to whom it had apparently given much pleasure one whom
thanked the baronet in the name the sex and complimented him on his
gallantry which she said was truly characteristic his country
to sir felix an encomium from a fair lady was ever irresistible
he bowed expressed a commensurate feeling gratitude for the honour
conferred upon him and professed himself an ardent admirer the whole
 women kind concluding by humming a stanza from burns
auld nature swears the lovely dears
her noblest work she classes o
her prentice han she tried on man
and then she made the lasses o
unluckily for the apophthegm the baronet it so happened that a
quarrel took place in the immediate vicinity and hearing the party
between two rival female fruiterers the emerald isle during which
incivilities were exchanged in language not altogether acceptable to the
auricular organs delicacy the brogue was that munster the
war words waged quicker and faster and from invective the heroines
seemed rapidly approximating to actual battle neither parkkeeper nor
constable were at hand and although the surrounding mobility laughed
at the tumult and enjoyed the storm sir felix much distressed at
so untoward an incident and deeply interested in the honour his
country so lately the theme elegant panegyric dashed through the
crowd the component parts which he scattered aside like chaff and
arrested the further progress the wranglers
arrah now for the honour munster be any ye brats the devil's
own begetting
hear him hear him hear the umpire resounded from all quarters
may the devil make hellbroth ye both in his own caldron
 the mirth the multitude became now still more absent
intermixes sans inquiry with honourable rank and even
where inquiry is deemed necessary all minor considerations
vanish before the talismanic influence wealth is he
rich incalculably so then let's have him by all means
thus the initiated chesterfield obtain admission into
polished society although the principles politeness
inculcated by that nobleman contain as a celebrated
lexicographer said them the morals a whe and the
manners a dancingmaster
the party having lounged away another pleasant hour made ultimately
their exit from the park by the stableyard and entering pall mall
were agreeably surprised with a very interesting exhibition
during many years the late king's reign it was usual on the
birthday anniversary for the different mail coaches to pass in review
before his majesty in front st james's palace the custom still
prevails
on the present occasion numerous spectators had assembled opposite carl
tonhouse and it is presumed that the sovereign thence witnessed the
procession although he was not within the view public observation
 above thirty mail coaches fresh gilt and painted or in
the language churchwardens beautified and each drawn by four
noblespirited yet perfectly tractable horses elegantly caparisoned
now made their appearance the cavalcade moved slowly onward the
prancing steeds impatient restraint and conscious superiority
on the box each vehicle was seated a portly good looking man
the knowing jehu the road and behind was the guard occasionally
winding his buglehorn with melodious and scientific ability the
reins and harness were new so also were the royal liveries the
coachmen and guards mounted conductors led the van the procession
while others accompanied it on either side and the interest the
scene was considerably heightened by each coach being occupied inside
by handsome welldressed women and children the rear this imposing
spectacle was brought up by a long train the twopenny postboys all
newly clothed in the royal uniform and mounted on hardy ponies chiefly
 the highland and shetland breed the cavalcade halted in front the
royal residence and gave three cheers in honour the day which
were heartily returned by the populace the procession then resumed its
progress by charingcross the strand fleetstreet ludgatehill round
st paul's and by cheapside into lombardstreet
passing up the new street the associates reached the mansion 
dashall who had previously engaged his friends to dinner
an elegant repast was immediately served up and highly enjoyed by the
party after such prolonged exercise and abstinence
the conversation turning on the recent interesting exhibition it was
universally acknowledged that the introduction the mail coach into
the establishment the general postoffice might be classed among the
highest improvements the age as amazingly accelerating the
celerity intercourse with all parts the empire neither was
the wellmerited meed encomium withheld from the twopennypost
institution by which so frequently in the course the day the
facility communication is kept up within the metropolis and suburbs
extending to all decencies and bounded only by the limits the
bills mortality dashall who seldom let slip an opportunity 
appropriate remark digressed from the procession to the
important national utility the postoffice and thence by easy
transition to the sublime powers the human mind as emphatically
exemplified in the invention writing and printing while sir felix
who was well experienced in the british poets favoured his aunt with a
quotation from pope's epistle heroism to abelard subject however
to such whimsical interpolation as he deemed suitable to the occasion
heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid some antique
lovesick north ireland maid they live they speak they breathe
what age inspires preposterous fondness and impure desires the latent
wish without a blush impart reveal the frailties a morbid heart
speed the neglected sigh from soul to soul and waft a groan from indus
to the pole
the reading miss macgilligan like her ideas was rather on a
contracted scale she suspected however that her nephew had aimed
against her the shafts ridicule and was preparing her resentment
accordingly when the baronet deprecating her wrath assured her that
he had recited the lines exactly as originally written and that in the
present clay they had no personal application having been composed by
a little cynical fellow many years before miss macgilligan came into
existence the lady gave credence to the assertion and the impending
storm was happily averted
the residence royalty being within the precinct st james's the
bells the neighbouring church sounded a merry peal in the ears 
the party and were responded to by those st martininthefields
a parish which it is remarkable that his majesty george was once
churchwarden serving the office course by deputy the steeple
 this church as well as those many others in the metropolis
displayed throughout the day the royal standard a manifestation 
loyalty which likewise extended itself to the liquid element old
father thames where many the vessels commemorated the anniversary by
frequent salutes artillery under the decorative and splendid canopy
formed by the colours all nations
 the carriages the foreign ambassadors and those the
friends government were again in requisition and rattled along the
streets towards the several mansions the members administration
who each in conformity with ancient usage gave a grand dinner on the
birthday at least on that appointed for its celebration
at these dinners said dashall politics and etiquette are both laid
aside conviviality is the order the day the glass the joke
the repartee and the retort courteous circulate freely and all is
harmony and good humour
with sometimes a sprinkling alloy said the squire i have heard
that during the administration mr pitt he and the lord chancellor
throw were frequently at variance on subjects having no reference to
politics and even under the exhilarating influence the grape
the party were all attention and the squire proceeded at a cabinet
dinner a discussion took place between the premier and lord chancellor
as to the comparative merits the latin and english languages mr
pitt gave the preference to the former the chancellor to the
latter and the arguments on both sides were carried on with equal
pertinacity the premier would not yield a jot in opinion becoming at
last impatient opposition
why said he the english language is an ambiguity two
negatives make an affirmative but in the latin two negatives make a
positive then said the chancellor your father and mother must
have been two negatives to make such a positive fellow as you are
 lord chancellor throw although a very eccentric
character was yet a man uncommon benevolence a vacancy
having occurred in a valuable living which he had the
presentation numerous were the candidates for the benefice
and amongst others one recommended by several the
nobility friends the ministry who made himself sure 
the appointment although directly or indirectly the
chancellor had not given any promise in the meanwhile it
was one morning announced to his lordship that a gentleman
apparently a clergyman waited the honour an interview
the servant was ordered to shew the stranger into the
library whither the chancellor shortly repaired and
inquired the object the visit my lord said the
other i served the office curate under the deceased
rector and understanding that the presentation is in your
lordship's gift you want the living exclaimed the
chancellor gruffly no my lord my humble pretensions
soar not so high but i presume most respectfully to
entreat your lordship's influence with the new incumbent
that i may be continued in the curacy surprised and
pleased by the singular modesty the applicant who had
served the same parish as curate above twenty years and now
produced the most ample testimonials character his
lordship entered into conversation with him and found him
 extensive erudition and orthodox principles he
ascertained besides that this poor curate had a wife with
six children entirely dependent on his exertions for
support and that the remuneration allowed for the faithful
discharge arduous duties had been only thirty pounds per
annum the chancellor now promised his influence in behalf
 the curate with the person who probably might succeed to
the living i shall see him added his lordship this
very day attend me tomorrow and you shall know the
result the curate took his leave and in the course the
morning the wouldbe rector made his appearance o
exclaimed his lordship entering directly into the business
i have had a humble suitor with me today the curate 
the late incumbent whom you are desirous succeeding he
wishes to continue in the curacy the poor man is burthened
with a large family and hitherto has been very inadequately
rewarded for his labour in the productive vineyard which
you anticipate the possession and emolument suppose that
you constitute the happiness this worthy man by giving
him a salary one hundred pounds per annum he will have
all the duties to perform and you will pocket a surplus
even then seven hundred a year for in fact doing
nothing this wouldbe was astonished he had never before
heard a curate in the receipt one hundred pounds per
annum besides he had already engaged a person to do the
duty for twentyfive pounds fired with indignation at the
inhumanity and arrogant presumption this calloushearted
clergyman what exclaimed his lordship and so you
would turn the poor curate out doors and abridge the
miserable pittance his successor and all this before
you've got the living john shew this fellmo down stairs
gladly would this incumbent by anticipation have conceded
every point required but it was too late the die was cast
and he found himself in the street unknowing how he got
there whether on his hands or his lucas next day the
curate was announced i have not been able to succeed
said his lordship the new incumbent has engaged a person
who will do the duty for twentyfive pounds per annum his
lordship paused and the unfortunate curate looked the
personification despondency cheer up man exclaimed
his lordship if i have not influence sufficient to
continue you in possession the curacy i can at least
give you the living putting into the hands at the same
time the amazed curate the presentation to a rectory
worth eight hundred pounds per annum here we must draw the
grecian painter's veil the gratification on either side
may be conceived but cannot be expressed
 sir felix laughed heartily at this anecdote and inquired 
his aunt whether she knew any the positive family in the north 
ireland
perfectly well retorted the lady they are allied to the
roundheads the province munster
this reproof which was hailed with applause by tom and bob
dumbfoundered the baronet who became suddenly taciturn but his
habitual good humour predominated and conscious that he had brought
on himself the inflicted castigation he resolved on a cessation 
hostilities for the remainder the evening
the invitation by dashall having been without formal ceremony and
unhesitatingly accepted by miss macgilligan and her nephew they now in
turn claimed the like privilege freedom by soliciting the company
 the two cousins to supper a request which tom and bob cheerfully
acquiesced in and the party immediately set out for the baronet's
lodgings preferring to walk the short distance that they might view
more leisurely the accustomed illuminations on the anniversary his
majesty's birthday
the variegated lamps were tastefully arranged but this effusion 
loyalty was rather an interested than interesting description being
confined wholly to the publicoffices the theatres and the different
houses his majesty's tradesmen no other habitation in this immense
metropolis bearing any external indication attachment on the part 
its occupant to the sovereign the british empire
here comes a set jolly fellows exclaimed the baronet as the party
 friends turned into bowstreet from coventgarden who are at least
determined to honour the anniversary st george and their sovereign
the clang marrow bones and cleavers resounding with harsh and
stunning dissonance
rather said dashall fellows determined to levy contributions on the
public caring as little for the actual george the king as they do for
the fabulous george the champion
now loud and yet louder the grating din grew
and near and more near still the butchergang drew
rapacious obstreperous a turbulent set
and bent on annoyance all whom they met
 it was in vain that our party attempted to avoid them by
crossing the street the intention was quickly thwarted by these
selflicensed prowlers who intercepting our associates in the
carriageway encircled them in such a manner as to preclude the
possibility extrication and raised at the same time a discoid
 sounds compared with which the vocal minstrelsy the longeared
braying fraternity would have been the music the spheres
sir felix in chastisement their arrogance would singly have
encountered the whole group had he not been restrained by tom and bob
who rather than engage in a street brawl with a host pertinacious
adversaries chose to yield to circumstances and purchase freedom
at the expense a trifling pecuniary consideration with which the
collectors departed well satisfied
our observers having thus obtained their liberty renewed their walk
and reached the lodgings the baronet without farther interruption
during their perambulation the following article was put into the hands
 the squire with which we shall conclude our chapter incidents
the king and the laureat
a loyal birthday effusion
hail mighty monarch a mighty people
while tuneful peals resound from tower and steeple
and thundering cannons gratulations roar
frightening old father thames from shore to shore
for king or etiquette while nobles caring
to buckinghamhouse by hundreds are repairing
with gorgeous dames to whom this day a bliss is
accompanied by smiling lovely misses
 eager appetite who long to gorge
and batten on the favours king george
while london's mayor and aldermen set out
in civic state to grace the royal rout
while strut the guards in black straps and white gaiters
in honour their patron and creators
while general birnie musters all his forces
 foot police and spavin police horses
to guard st james's park from innovation
and cheque the daringness depredation
while for those partizans who mi
 character is an abundant and everlasting supply humour and
eccentricity for an observant quiz like yourself and being fly to most
occurrences either in town or country i shall rather confine myself to
the most remarkable circumstances that happen to strike my recollection
us we proceed the first that occurs at this moment is the opening a
new establishment in regentstreet under the title the cafe royale
to which as we have not yet paid a visit i propose now to direct your
steps
cafe royale repeated sparkle there is something frenchified in the
sound i suppose it is quite in the tip top stile elegance
so says report
then allons but as we proceed i beg to ask one question if it
be considered important in a national point view that the superior
elegancies our parisian neighbours should be engrafted on our own
habits and that an establishment this nature should be formed with
a view its becoming the resort rank and fashion whether any good
reason can be given why such an establishment in an english city for
englishmen should not have an english title
a most extraordinary question for a fashionable man
it may be so continued sparkle but you must attribute it to my
country habits thinking however as i like argument better than
assertion i see no reason to abandon my question the adoption 
any thing foreign is only rational in proportion as it is useful or
agreeable for foreign wines foreign fruits foreign made coffee c
no one can be a greater advocate than myself but i apprehend that these
good things may taste as well whether the room in which they are taken
be called by a french or an english name
that is a truth so self evident as to require no reply and really i
can give no sort reason for the adoption a french title unless
it be with a view to give it that air novelty which invariably proves
attractive to johnny bull and i think i need not attempt to explain to
you the importance a title
however said sparkle i cannot help thinking that if the place
alluded to is to become a permanent establishment it would become an
englishman to have an english name for it we need not be ashamed our
language although some folks disdain to use it if they can find
any substitute however inapt why should it not be called the royal
coffeehouse the king's coffeehouse the patrician the universal orin
fact any thing so that it be english
 because said tallyhoho those titles are already engrossed
by newspaper editors coffeeshops a lower order magazines c
for instance we have the royal magazine the universal magazine
and consequently these are all grown common and any thing common is
extremely vulgar
besides continued dashall cafe royale is a mouthful without
attacking its contents and the very sound it seems to impart a
taste before you approach it what may be obtained in the interior
zounds this country life your's seems to have altered your opinions
and almost obliterated your former education i never had any relish for
it
in town let me live and in town let me die for in truth can't
relish the country not i if one must have a villa in summer to dwell
oh give me the sweet shady side pall mall
by this time they had reached the cafe royale and upon entrance were
ushered by a man in blue livery with gold laced trimmings into an
apartment far exceeding in splendour any thing that their previous
conversation had led them to expect the walls formed looking glass
and rich tapestry and ornamented in a fanciful manner reflected their
persons as they passed along at every point while the choicest flowers
and shrubs with which they were surrounded sent forth a delightful
fragrance and gave some distant idea eastern luxuries
here said the hon tom dashall is elegance at least and if
the accommodations are found to be equally good it can be little
consequence to us whether the place itself have an english or a foreign
name
i confess replied sparkle that i still conceive that as a place
 resort appropriated to the upper ranks natives and foreigners
magnificent in its decorations superior in its accommodations and
conducted with skill and liberality to become truly national and
deserving support it should be honoured with an english title
and that it certainly is continued dashall not only one but many
for nobility is frequently to be found within its walls nay a proof 
it appears at this moment for there is lord p and lord c now
entering but come let us try the coffee catch a view the papers
and proceed
 they had now seated themselves near an elderly gentleman who
seemed to be in deep contemplation occasionally rubbing his hands with
apparent gratification and shaking his head with importance while he
glanced over a newspaper which lay before him
i should judge said tallyhoho he is a member parliament
probably conning over the report his last night's speech in the
house
or probably said dashall an author in search ideas for his
next publication wherein he intends to cut up the ministers and their
measures
yes continued sparkle or a quack doctor examining if the editor
has given insertion to his new flaming advertisement wherein he
promises to perform what is utterly impossible to be accomplished
i wonder if he can speak said tom laying clown the paper i'll try
him a fine morning sir
as this was directed immediately to meet the old gentleman's ear he
looked up for the first time since they had entered
beautiful sir was the reply and here the conversation ceased again
excellent coffee said sparkle is there any news today sir
endeavouring to rouse him again
there is always news sir was the reply taking a plentiful supply 
snuff
 one sort or other continued bon
why yes have we not every day a quantity newspapers that make their
appearance with the sun
truly replied sparkle but you could hardly misunderstand me i
alluded to something out the common run events such for
instance as relates to the interests the nation the agricultural
distress the distress the irish the state the american
independents the proceedings the spanish cortes and the french
chamber the movements the greeks the operations turkey and
russia or the or 
why sir your inquiries are very rational and as i perceive you have
a desire for intelligence and i have at all times a desire to impart
such as i am in possession for the benefit others the newspapers
have abundance information but i must say the editors though men 
education and intelligence are not always well informed besides sir
there is no reliance on their assertions many valuable and important
secrets are in the hands individuals which never find their way into
the public journals
 having proceeded thus far our three friends were all
anxiety to continue what now assumed the appearance an interesting
conversation
the nation is gull'd by misrepresentation from the high to the low one
system is acted upon but i have a document in my pocket which came into
my possession in rather an extraordinary manner and is as extraordinary
in its contents it was thrust into my hand on my way here by a
stranger who instantly disappeared
a curious salute observed tom probably some state paper some
information on foreign affairs or a petition to be presented to the
house
the fact is sir as i had no conversation with the stranger i was
ignorant the importance the document but upon opening it judge
 my astonishment when i found it concerned a prince well known to the
british nation whose interests depend on its support
o ho said sparkle then perhaps it is a delicate nature and more
attaching to private circumstances than public affairs
you shall hear sir it was an appeal to myself amongst others in
which russia was stated to be in such connection with greece that
the heads this kingdom could not but be conscious the important
results results sir that were enough to make one's hair stand on 
indeed i have never been able to dismiss the subject from my mind since
i first cast my eye over the information
zounds then cried dashall there is much to be apprehended
it is impossible for me continued the old gentleman to say how
far the distinguished person to whom i have alluded has already or
may hereafter succeed in the objects he has in view but this i think
certain that if he can but interest the poles on his side his affairs
must thrive
the hon tom dashall by this time was puzzled with the lengthened
introduction this gentleman was giving he sipped his coffee looked
grave smiled took up the paper pretended to read then laid it down
again
 sparkle looked wise and betrayed his anxiety by moving closer
to the communicant tallyhoho fixed his eyes on the old gentleman with an
apparent desire to count the words he uttered
in the meantime continued the interesting stranger he is so
indefatigable in diffusing through all ranks society by means the
press and private agents a knowledge the power he has smoothing
the way to success that the crown ought to receive his proffered aid
for its own benefit
then said sparkle it really is a document public importance if
not too great a favour might we be allowed a sight the 
the document oh certainly sir said he hastily rising and drawing
a printed paper from his pocket i will leave it with you then
throwing it on the table he made a precipitate retreat
the little care which the old gentleman seemed to take this scrap 
importance struck them all with wonder
a rum old codger said tom and i recommend his observations as well
as the produce his pocket to the serious consideration our friend
sparkle who will perhaps read this paper for the benefit us all
sparkle who by this time had unfolded this mysterious paper burst into
a hearty laugh and as soon as he could command his risibility he read
as follows
prince's russia oil for promoting the growth hair
and sparkle introduced to greece said tom well the old buck has
paid you off for your interruption however he has certainly proved his
own assertion that there is no reliance on any body
a mountain in labour continued tom i think he had you in a line
however
i cannot help thinking replied sparkle that there is a great
similarity between him and some our most popular parliamentary
orators for he has said a great deal to little purpose but come let
us move on and lose no more time in the french coffee house discussing
the merits or virtues russia oil
 this proposition being acceded to our friends now took their
way along pall mall where the improvements recently made struck sparkle
with pleasure and delight the appearance new and elegant houses
occupying the situation buildings a shabby and mean exterior
and the introduction new streets were subjects considerable
admiration
the rapidity alterations in london said sparkle are almost
inconceivable
that remark replied tom only arises from your late absence from the
scene action for to us who frequently see their progress there is
but little to excite wonder now for my part i am more astonished
in present times when so many complaints are made distress that
occupiers can be found for them and also seeing the increase 
buildings at every part the environs london where tenants can be
found to occupy them
i confess said tallyhoho that is a subject which i have often thought
upon without being able to come to any reasonable conclusion it appears
to me to prove a great increase population for although i am aware
 the continued influx new comers from the country the towns and
villages appear as full as ever
i am not able to solve the mystery to my own satisfaction replied
sparkle in either case though i cannot help acknowledging the facts
alluded to it however seems in this place to prove the correctness 
the poet's lines who says
wherever round this restless world we range
nothing seems constant saving constant change
like some magician waving mystic wand
improvement metamorphoses the land
grubs up pulls down then plants and builds anew
till scenes once loved are banished from our view
the draughtsman with officious eye surveys
what capabilities a site displays
how things may be made better for the worse
and much improve at least the schemer's purse
continuing their course along parliamentstreet they soon arrived at
westminsterbridge when the day proving extremely fine it was proposed
to embrace the opportunity making an excursion by water the tide
served for london bridge and without further ceremony tom bob and
sparkle jumped into a wherry and were quickly gliding along upon the
bosom old father thames the smiling appearance the day and the
smooth unruffled surface the water excited the most cheerful and
enlivening feelings the mind
 nice weather for the rowing match said a bluff looking
sturdy built waterman who had doffed his coat waistcoat and cravat
in order to facilitate him in performing his duty
rowing match inquired tom when does it take place
why this afternoon at four o'clock your honour vauxhall will be very
full tonight them ere people what's got it now are a getting plenty
 company and they will have a bumper tonight for the gentlemen what
belongs to the funny club gives a funny to be rowed for
that's funny enough exclaimed sparkle
and convenient too said tom for as we have no engagement for the
evening we can mingle with the lads on their water frolic
with all my heart said bob and as i am given to understand vauxhall
is greatly improved it will make an admirable wind up the day
approaching waterloo bridge what have we here exclaimed tallyhoho
that said tom is a floating fire engine for the protection 
shipping and sometimes very useful in cases fire on the banks the
river
an excellent idea continued bob because they can never be in want
 water
will you sit a little more this way sir if you please we shall trim
better
bob rose hastily upon this intimation and had not his cousin caught him
by the coat would have trimmed himself into the watery element
zounds man you had nearly upset us all you must trim the boat and
sit steady or we shall all go to davy's locker you must not attempt
to dance in such a vehicle as this
bob's confusion at this circumstance created laughter to his two
friends which however he could not exactly enjoy with the same relish
nor did he perfectly recover himself till they were safely landed at
tower stairs
now said tom i propose a peep at the interior this place a row
down to greenwich to dinner and then a touch at the rowing match what
say you agreed on all hands
 then said the hon tom dashall wait for us here old boy
and you shall be our conveyancer
i don't know nothing you gentlemen and you understand me i'm
not a going to be done i'm too old a hand to be catch'd in that there
fashion but if so be you engages me for the day you can take the
number my boat but then you must tip
right said sparkle who knows whether we shall escape the lions and
then how is old rough and tough to get paid
you'll excuse me gentlemen i don't mean no affront upon my soul but
i have stood the nonsense before now and been flung but i won't
be served out in that there way any more i am up to the gossip and
expects you'll come down with the rag
certainly said tom dashall with a smile i am aware the hint
which by the way is pretty broadly conveyed therefore be satisfied
and giving him a sovereign they proceeded into the tower
the entrance to the tower from the wharf is by a drawbridge near to
which is a cut connecting the river with the ditch having a water gate
called traitor's gate state prisoners having been formerly conveyed by
this passage from the tower to westminster for trial and over this gate
is the waterworks which supply the fortress
having passed the drawbridge bob looked around him almost conceiving
himself in a new world he saw houses and streets which he had
formed no conception
zounds said he this tower seems almost to contain a city
yes replied dashall it occupies some ground its extent within the
walls is twelve acres and five roods the exterior circuit the ditch
which entirely surrounds it is feet the principal buildings are
the church the white tower the ordnance office the record office
the jewel office the horse armoury the grand store house the
small armoury the houses belonging to the officers barracks for the
garrison and two settling houses for the accommodation the military
and the inhabitants
 the white tower as it is called is a large square building in
the centre the fortress on the top which are four watch towers
one being at present used as an observatory neither the sides this
building nor the small towers are uniform the walls are whitewashed
near to it is the grand storehouse a plain building brick and stone
 feet long and feet broad
being conducted to the spanish armory tallyhoho was much gratified
with a view its contents trophies the famous victory queen
elizabeth over the spanish armada among which the most remarkable were
the thumb screws intended to be used in order to extort confession
from the english where their money was hidden the axe with which
the unfortunate anne sullen was beheaded by order henry viii
a representation queen elizabeth in armour standing by a
creamcoloured horse attended by a page also attracted his attention
her majesty being dressed in the armour she wore at the time she
addressed her brave army at tilbury in with a white silk
petticoat richly ornamented with pearls and spangles in the small
armory which is one the finest rooms in europe containing complete
stands arms for men they could not but admire the beautiful
and elegant manner in which the arms were disposed forming tasteful
devices in a variety figures a piece ordnance from egypt and the
highland broadsword also claimed particular notice
 the spanish armory small armory train artillery and
horse armory may be seen at the price s each person
with a compliment per company to the warder
the volunteer armory containing arms piled in beautiful order for
 men with pikes swords c in immense numbers presented
to them a fine figure charles brandon duke suffolk in bright
armour bearing the very lance he actually used in his lifetime which
is no less than feet long the sea armory containing arms for nearly
 seamen and marines and the royal artillery which is partly kept
on the ground floor under the small armory next underwent inspection
here they could not help admiring the room which is feet long
 feet wide and feet high and the many peculiarly fine pieces 
cannon which it contained the artillery is ranged on each side leaving
a passage in the centre ten feet in breadth twenty pillars in
this room support the small armory above which are hung round with
implements war and trophies taken from the enemy producing
altogether a grand and imposing effect
 the horse armory a noble room crowded with
curiosities proved a source high gratification here they found
themselves in company with all the kings england from william the
conqueror to george iii the whole on horseback and in armour the
armour john gaunt duke lancaster seven feet high and the
sword and lance proportionable size were viewed as objects 
wonder
in the jewel office containing the regalia state was the next
object to which they directed their attention here they were shewn the
imperial crown with which the kings england are crowned it is
made gold enriched with diamonds emeralds rubies sapphires
and pearls the cap is purple velvet lined with white safety and
turned up with three rows ermine this crown is never used but at
coronations the golden globe which is placed in the king's right hand
before he is crowned the golden sceptre and its cross upon a
large amethyst decorated with table diamonds the sceptre which is
considered to be far the most ancient in the collection and probably a
part the original regalia is covered with jewels and gothic enamel
work surmounted with an onyx dove was found by the present keeper
in the year and is estimated at a very high value st edward's
staff made beaten gold and which is borne before the king in the
coronation procession is feet inches and a half in length and 
inches and quarters round the golden salt seller the sword mercy
without a point the grand silver font used for christening the
royal family and the crown state worn by the king at his meeting
 the parliament and other state occasions were viewed in succession
with admiration and delight the latter is great splendour and value
it is covered with precious stones a large size and on the top 
its cross is a pearl which charles i pledged for eighteen thousand
pounds to the dutch republic under the cross is an emerald diamond
 a palish green colour valued at one hundred thousand pounds being
seven inches and
 the jewel office is shewn for s each person in company
a single person pays s d it may be seen separately but
not without a warder
a half in circumference in the front is a rock ruby in its purely
natural state unpolished three inches in length the value which
cannot be estimated several other curiosities state regalia such as
the golden eagle the golden spur the crown queen mary the cross
 king william and the diadem worn by the queens anne and mary were
numbered among the valuable jewels contained in this office together
with abundance curious old plate the value which independent
 several the jewels which are inestimable is not less than two
millions sterling
 now said dashall as they left the jewel office we have
taken a view the inanimate we must not leave the spot without
a peep at the lionsl for though i believe there is nothing very
extraordinary in the collection more than may be seen at the menagerie
at exeter change it would be an unpardonable omission not to see the
lions in the tower
 the wild beasts c are shewn at s each
for this purpose they proceeded to the western entrance where they were
quickly introduced by the keeper to the various animals under his care
and who in going round with them explained as usual their several
histories
in examining these various curiosities time had imperceptibly stolen a
march upon them and their original plan proceeding to greenwich was
found to be impracticable besides which upon reaching the stairs where
they had landed the bluff old waterman was not to be found
zounds said dashall this looks like a do i wonder what's become 
the old blade
sparkle began to laugh and bob bit his lip tom made inquiry a boy
at the stairs who informed him that barney was gone to the settling
house to smoak a pipe
all right said tom then we will soon rouse him and start
upon this they moved back again into the tower and according to the
directions they had received they found barney in the taproom
puffing away care and singing with stentorian voice to the surrounding
company
from elongate to limehouse hole
you will not meet a kinder soul
while the thames is flowing
pull away ho pull away ho
 in search real life and character and at all times rather
inclined to promote mirth than spoil sport our friends immediately
entered unperceived by barney and taking an opposite corner the
room were quickly attended by the landlord who received orders and
produced them supplies
the song being over and barney rewarded for his exertions by the most
enthusiastic applause the room he renewed his pipe at the same
time declaring to a soldier who sat near him he thought he had miss'd
fire for he was d d if he didn't think he'd lost his company
or his company had lost him but that he had taken care to nibble the
blunt and upon that there score all was right so landlord tip us
another quart and if they don't make their appearance by the time
i've got through that i'll tip them the toddle shove off my boat and
disappear that's the time day an't it boy
why aye to be sure replied the soldier you watermen leads a happy
life you are your own masters you does just as you pleases while a
soldier dare as well be d d as desert his post but i say barney
mind what
you says nose nose accompanying the last two words with a
significant action placing his finger on his nose and winking his
eye
upon this intimation which appeared to be well understood by barney
he puffed off an immoderate cloud smoke and looking round the room
perceived his customers in the corner
be quiet said he that's my fare so it's all right again do you
want me gentlemen i am always ready so that whenever you says the
word barney's your boy
presently said dashall for it would be hard to make you start upon
a full jorum
why i must say continued barney i never likes to leave a foaming
quart behind me and catching hold the pot heavy wet he roared
out
what a hearty blade am i
care can never touch my heart
every trouble i defy
while i view the foaming quart
and taking a hearty drink he handed it to his companion filled
his pipe afresh lighted and informed the gentlemen he was at their
service when in a few minutes all being ready they were quickly onboard

 i don't like the looks the weather my masters why we
shall have a shower presently where will you go to
to vauxhall was the reply
very well your honour then here goes but if you don't get a sousing
my name an't barney
this prognostication proved true for before they reached blacksmiths
bridge a smart shower came on which nearly wetted them through before
they could reach land when this was accomplished they proceeded to the
horn tavern doctors commons where they partook an excellent repast
and the weather clearing up they again joined barney
by this time the promising fineness the evening had induced many
to venture forth to the rowing match and the river was all gaiety and
delight boats every description were seen filled with well dressed
persons both male and female the smiling countenances the lads and
lasses were in unison with the laughing sun that darted his brilliant
beams upon the dimpled wave which seemed to leap in return with
grateful animation the shores were lined with spectators anxiously
waiting the moment for the commencement this trial skill our
friends were highly delighted with the prospect before them and at the
appointed time having rested on their oars near the place starting
they saw with pleasure the active preparations on the part the
competitors and upon the signal being given for the start the river
appeared to consist nothing but moving conveyances happy faces
all guided in one direction the shouts the various friends the
occasionally successful candidates for the honour victory and the
skill and dexterity with which they manoeuvred against each other were
subjects continued admiration while bands music were heard from
boats that intermingled with the throng the lads the funny club were
in high glee numerous cutters and sailing boats with their owners and
visiting friends were also in the throng barney pulled away like
a good one and for a considerable distance kept nearly up with the
principal actors in this gay and animated scene aquatic diversion
and arrived off cumberland gardens just in time to have an excellent
view the winner coming in at the appointed spot in prime style
amidst the loud and reiterated plaudits his friends
 the intention visiting vauxhall gardens was however for
the present evening relinquished and our party feeling fatigued by
their excursion repaired homeward where for the present we shall leave
them to their quiet and repose
chapter xxii
i hate that drum's discordant sound
still rolling round and round and round
 exclaimed dashall as he advanced from the breakfast table
towards the window when a pleasing and singular streetexhibition
presented itself which had attracted around a numerous audience all
ages and conditions
an itinerant purveyor novelties was in the act showing forth to an
admiring crowd the docility a tame hare on a table in the street
on which was placed a drum the little animal stood in an erect
posture and with surprising tractableness obeyed the commands its
exhibiter delivered in very broken english with which nevertheless
it seemed perfectly conversant
vat matter now dat you be so solly and no take notice your good
friends come are shew your politesse and salute de gentlemen
at de window who so kind as come to look at you make way dere good
peoples and leetel chiltern dat de gentlemen sail see dat will do
now are begin do your obeisance all round
the animal without any apparent instruction to whom to give the
precedency obeisance immediately faced de gentlemen at de
window and saluted them with a cone particular respect which
being acknowledged with a motion the hand by dashall the intelligent
animal expressed its sense his complacency by a second obeisance
more profound than the first
the spectators applauded and the performer testified its gratitude by a
bow all round
dat all good now are tree role on de from for le roi
d'angletterre vive le roi d'anglettere 
this command the animal very promptly obeyed by substituting its forefeet
for sticks and giving three prolonged rolls the drum each indistinct
succession
now den for messieurs
 with equal alacrity this hint was attended to and as le roi
d'angletterre had three so de gentlemen at de window were honoured
with two rolls the drum
the like compliment was paid to all de english peoples and the minor
salute one roll was given to the surrounding spectators
the indefatigable drummer was next required to give a token regard
for the cook but this he declined to do and the order though
frequently given was as frequently complied with
will you take notice me den
this question was instantly answered by the accustomed mark respect
gentleman at de window and peoples on de street my leetel drummer
no love de cook no show her de respect dat he show you he know dat de
cook be no friend de pauvre hare then turning towards the animal
vat said he must i speak all de tanks oneself
in deficiency speech the animal reiterated its obeisance
diable exclaimed the exhibiter here comes de cook to kill and spit
you
the hare instantly hastened to its hiding place and thus terminated the
exhibition
this epitome the world observed tallyhoho lacks nothing to gratify
every sense man here industry is on the alert to accumulate wealth
and dissipation in haste to spend it here riot and licentiousness
roll triumphantly in gilded state while merit pines in penury and
obscurity and here ingenuity roams the streets for a scanty and
precarious subsistence exhibiting learned pigs dogs and so
forth that will cast accounts with the precision an experienced
arithmetician and a tame hare that will beat a drum and make a bow
more gracefully than a dancingmaster this last instance human
ingeniousness by which the poor frenchman picks up a living would
almost induce a belief that the power art is inimitable and that
apparently insurmountable difficulties may be overcome by diligent
perseverance who besides this foreigner would have thought 
divesting a hare its natural timidity and rendering it subservient
by a display intelligence to the acquirement his subsistence
 and who said dashall would have thought but a german 
training canarybirds to imitate military evolution make a prisoner
 one their fellows as a deserter try and condemn him to
death apparently execute the sentence by shooting him with a small
gun and finally bear away the motionless and seemingly lifeless body
on a wheelbarrow for interment nay who would think inverting the
order nature by creating and cementing a union friendship between
cats and birds and mice associating them together within the confines
 a cage in the utmost harmony social intercourse and who shall
presume to set bounds to the human art that from a deal board has
constructed the figure a man that will beat at the difficult game 
chess the first players in europe and created a wooden musician
that in a solo from the trumpet will excel the best living performers on
that instrument
 it appears by the following letter from pressure in
hungary that this wonderful automaton was originally
invented and exhibited there
during my stay in this city i have been so happy as to
form an acquaintance with m de kempett an aulic counsellor
and director general the salt mines in hungary it seems
impossible to attain to a more perfect knowledge 
mechanics than this gentleman hath done at least no artist
has yet been able to produce a machine so wonderful in its
kind as what he constructed about a year ago m de
kempett excited by the accounts he received the
extraordinary performances the celebrated m de
vaucanson and some other men genius in prance and
england at first aimed at nothing more than to imitate
those artists but he has done more he has excelled them
he has constructed an automaton which can play at chess
with the most skilful players this machine represents a man
 the natural size dressed like a turk sitting before the
table which holds the chessboard this table which is
about three feet and a half long and about two feet and a
half broad is supported by four feet that roll on castors
in order the more easily to change its situation which the
inventor fails not to do from time to time in order to take
away all suspicion any communication both the table and
the figure are full wheels springs and levers m de
kempett makes no difficulty shewing the inside the
machine especially when he finds any one suspects a boy to
be in it i have examined with attention all the parts both
 the table and figure and i am well assured there is not
the least ground for such an imputation i have played a
game at chess with the automaton myself i have particularly
remarked with great astonishment the precision with which
it made the various and complicated movements the arm
with which it plays it raises the arm it advances it
towards that part the chessboard on which the piece
stands which ought to be moved and then by a movement 
the wrist it brings the hand down upon the piece opens the
hand closes it upon the piece in order to grasp it lifts
it up and places it upon the square it is to be removed to
this done it lays its arm down upon a cushion which
is placed on the chessboard if it ought to
take one its adversary's pieces then by one entire
movement it removes that piece quite off the chessboard
and by a series such movements as have been describing
it returns to take up its own piece and place it in the
square which the other had left vacant i attempted to
practise a small deception by giving the queen the move 
a knight but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed
on he took up my queen and replaced her in the square she
had been removed from all this is done with the same
readiness that a common player shews at this game and i
have often engaged with persons who played neither so
expeditiously nor so skilfully as this automaton who yet
would have been extremely affronted if one had compared
them to him you will perhaps expect me to propose some
conjectures as to the means employed to direct this machine
in its movements i wish i could form any that were
reasonable and wellfounded but notwithstanding the minute
attention with which i have repeatedly observed it i have
not been able in the least degree to form any hypothesis
which could satisfy myself the english ambassador prince
justinian and several english lords for whom the
inventor had the complaisance to make the figure play stood
round the table while i played the game they all had their
eyes on m de kempett who stood by the table or sometimes
removed five or six feet from it yet not one them could
discover the least motion in him that could influence the
automaton they who had seen the effects produced by the
loadstone in the curious exhibitions on the boulevards at
paris cried out that the loadstone must have been the
means here employed to direct the arm but besides that
there are many objections to this supposition m de
kempett with whom i have had long conversations since on
this subject offers to let any one bring as close as he
pleases to the table the strongest and bestarmed magnet
that can be found or any weight iron whatever without
the least fear that the movements his machine will be
affected or disturbed by it he also withdraws to any
distance you please and lets the figure play four or five
moves successively without approaching it it is unnecessary
to remark that the marvellous in this automaton consists
chiefly in this that it has not as in others the most
celebrated machines this sort one determined series 
movements but that it always moves in consequence the
manner in which its opponent moves which produces an
amazing multitude different combinations in its
movements m de kempett winds up from time to time the
springs the arm this automaton in order to renew its
moving force but this you will observe has no relation to
its guiding force or power direction which makes the
great merit this machine in general i am opinion
that the contriver influences the direction almost every
stroke played by the automaton although as i have said i
have sometimes seen him leave it to itself for many moves
together which in my opinion is the mostdifficult
circumstance all to comprehend in what regards this
machine m de kempett has the more merit in this invention
as he complains that his designs have not always been
seconded by workmen so skilful as was requisite to the exact
precision a work this nature and he hopes he shall
ere long produce to the world performances still more
surprising than this indeed one may expect every thing from
his knowledge and skill which are exceedingly enhanced by
his uncommon modesty never did genius triumph with less
ostentation
 london is a rare place for sights always something
new where the spirits need never flag through want amusement let
me recapitulate there is the automaton chessplayer and the automaton
trumpeter the family compact alias amicable society cat birds
and mice the military canaries and an hundred phenomena besides 
which we shall make the round in due time in the meanwhile let us
set out like the knight la mania in search adventures without
running the risk mistaking windmills for giants one the former
would indeed be a high treat to the insatiable curiosity the
inhabitants this metropolis and as to giants there are none on
shew since bartholomewfair excepting those stationary gentlemen the
twinbrothers gog and magog in guildhall
passing through the town without meeting with any new object worthy
 particular notice they found themselves at the extremity 
threadneedlestreet when dashall pointing to a neat plain building
this said he is the south sea house the south sea company was
established for the purpose an exclusive trade to the south seas
and many thousands were ruined by the speculation the iniquity and
deception were at last discovered and those who were at the head
were punished the eager hope wealth frequently engenders
disappointment but here credulity attained her zenith amongst other
schemes equally practicable the projectors this notorious bubble
set up a method making butter from beechtrees a plan to learn
people to cast their nativity an insurance against divorces and a way
 making deal boards out sawdust
and is it possible inquired tallyhoho that such most preposterous
theories obtained belief
even so answered dashall what is there in which human folly
will not believe we have all read the bottleconjurer the
prevalence curiosity is universal i could safely stake any money
that if public notice was given a person who would leap down his own
throat he would gain belief and a full audience would favour him with
their company to witness his marvellous performance
 this speculator by wholesale in english credulity
advertised that he would in the haymarket theatre
literally and bona fide creep into a quart bottle and
further would when inside such quart bottle entertain the
audience with a solo on the violin
long before the appointed hour performance the house was
crammed at all points and thousands were sent from the
doors for want room the most eager curiosity prevailed
as the time drew near for the commencement these
extraordinary feats and the clamour for the appearance 
the performer was incessant and vociferous at last he came
forward upon the stage and all was breathless attention
ladies and gentlemen i am sorry to say that i cannot tonight
find a bottle large enough for the purpose intended
but tomorrow i faithfully engage to go into a pint bottle
in atonement the present disappointment he then
retired the shock was electrical a dead silence prevailed
for a moment the delusion vanished and confusion worse
confounded ensued the interior the house was nearly
demolished his it h the d c was present and lost a
goldhilted sword during the wreck matter and the crush
 worlds the speculator made off with his booty
 proceeding into bishopsgatestreet the new city london
tavern caught the attention tallyhoho
this observed his friend is probably the first tavern in london
with reference to superior accommodation here congregate the most
eminent corporate bodies directors public institutions and others
on occasions business or enjoyment here the admirable arrangement
 every thing conducive to comfort is minutely attended to here the
plenitude abundance and the delicacies luxury distinguish the
festive board and the culinary art is shown forth to the very acme 
perfection which together with the varied unsophisticated excellence
 the richest wines secure to this celebrated tavern the continuance
 a wellmerited public approbation but one these days we shall
avail ourselves practical experience by forming part the company
at dinner
proposing in their way home to take the skirts the metropolis they
directed their course through moorfield where tallyhoho remarked on the
unseemly desolate waste there presenting itself and expressed surprise
that it was not appropriated to some purposes utility or ornament
 it appears answered dashall as if some such improvement
was in projection probably a new square if we may so opine from
present indications however be the intention what it may the
execution is uncommonly tardy with the exception the central
ironrailing the handsome structure on the opposite side the solitary
building on the right and range new houses on the left the tout
ensemble was the same twenty years ago it is a scene dilapidation
which might perhaps have been
more honoured in the breach than in th observance
i recollect that when a boy i frequently extended my rambles into
the quarters cornfields for so was this place then named from its
compartments exhibiting rural appearance even in the centre london
here were four enclosed fields displaying in the season the beautiful
verdure nature and numerous trees branching in ample shade over
two great walks that intersected each other at right angles and formed
the afternoon promenade the citizens wives and daughters in former
times the quarters cornfields were resorted to by holiday visitants
as the favourite place rendezvous where predominated the recreation
 manly exercises and shows gambols and merriment were the orders 
the day the present is an age improvement and yet i cannot think
in an already monstrously overgrown metropolis the substitution 
bricks and mortar an equivalent for green fields and rural simplicity
leaving cornfields they passed in a few minutes into finsburysquare
tallyhoho appeared surprised by its uniformly handsome edifices its
spacious extent and beautiful circular area in which the ground is
laid out and the shrubberies disposed to the very best advantage hereat
least he observed is a proof that taste and elegance are not
altogether excluded a civic residence
in this square taking its name from the division finsbury said
dashall reside many the merchants and other eminent citizens 
london and here in the decorations internally their respective
mansions they vie with the more courtly residents westward and exceed
them generally in the quietude domestic enjoyment
 renewing their walk along the city road the gate dunghill
fields buryingground standing conveniently open let us step in said
dashall this is the most extensive depository the dead in london
and as every grave almost is surmounted by a tombstone we cannot fail
in acquiring an impressive memento mori 
while examining a monumental record which there appeared a countless
number their attention was withdrawn from the dead and attracted by
the living an elderly personage arrayed in a rusty suit sables
with an ink bottle dangling from one the buttons his coat was
intently employed in copying a long yet well written inscription to
the memory patrick colquhoun lld author a treatise on the
police the metropolis and several other works great public
utility having accomplished his object the stranger saluted
dashall and tallyhoho in a manner so courteous as seemingly to invite
conversation
you have chosen sir observed mr dashall rather a sombre cast 
amusement
otherwise occupation said the stranger from which i derive
subsistence amidst the endless varieties real life in london i aman
epitaphcollector favoured by my friends with the appellation 
old mortality furnished them by the voluminous writer and meteor 
the north sir walter scott
do you collect asked tallyhoho with the view publishing on your
own account
no sir i really am not in possession the means wherewith
to embark on so hazardous a speculation i am thus employed by an
eccentric yet very worthy gentleman large property who ambitious
 transmitting his name to posterity means to favour the world with a
more multitudinous collection epitaphs than has hitherto appeared
in any age or nation his prospectus states monumental gleanings in
twentyfive quarto volumes
astonishing exclaimed dashall can it be possible that he ever will
be able to accomplish so vast an undertaking
and if he does said tallyhoho can it be possible that any person will
be found to read a production such magnitude and on such a subject
 that to him is a matter indifference said old
mortality he means to defray the entire charges and the object 
publication effected will rest satisfied with the approbation the
discerning few leaving encomium from the multitude to authors or
compilers more susceptible flattery
born with a stomach to digest a ton
as to the quantum materiel he is indefatigable in personal research
employing besides numerous collectors even in the sister island and in
this from the land'send to johnny grot's house
and when asked dashall is it probable that this gigantic work maybe
completed
can't say answered old mortality i should think at no very remote
period the collection is in daily accumulation and we are already in
possession above one hundred thousand
prodigious exclaimed dashall as dominic sampson says and pray
sir what number may your assiduities have contributed towards the
aggregate
that answered old mortality i cannot exactly ascertain to those
however already supplied this ground will yield a considerable
increase
may we solicit said tallyhoho without the imputation intrusion
the favour your reading to us from your tablebook a few the most
remarkable epitaphs
old mortality readily promised gratification as far as possible but he
had not his tablebook with him i have been employed to day said hein
making extracts from one our manuscript folio volumes for the
purpose insertion in the different metropolitan daily papers here
they are taking a small bundle from his pocket tied round with red
tape one for each paper permit me gentlemen for a moment just to
look over the exhortations
the triumvirate now seated themselves on a tombstone and old mortality
untying the bundle extracts laid them down in loose compact then
taking up the first and reading the superscription shewing for what
newspaper it was intended he reversed it on the tombstone this
said he is for the times british press morning post morning
chronicle morning advertiser morning herald public ledger all

the bundle and read the contents with an audible voice

interchanging civilities the party now separated the collector to
resume his occupation and the two friends their walk
twentyfive quarto volumes exclaimed the squire and exclusively
filled with epitaphs this fellow has set himself a task with a
vengeance
and which answered his friend he will never be able to accomplish
however the ambition renown as a voluminous collector is the less
censurable as being unattended by any its too frequently pernicious
concomitants and giving to others an acceptable and not irrational
employment he is only blameable in the projected extent not the nature
 his pursuit and happy would it be for mankind did the love fame
engender no greater evil than that if any which may accrue from the
herculean labours this epitaph collector
yet to us the uninitiated the country it would never occur that
there existed even in london a man who disseminated his fortune and
applied his mental and corporeal energies in gleaning epitaphs
neither perhaps would it occur that there existed even in london a
virtuoso who discovered that fleas were a species lobster and who
proceeded to proof by the ordeal boiling water on the supposition
that the process would change their hue from black to red and thus
satisfactorily establish the correctness his judgment unfortunately
however the boiled fleas still retained their original colour and the
ingenious hypothesis was reluctantly relinquished
 it is told another virtuoso that he was waited upon
one morning by a stranger who announced that he had the
opportunity procuring an inestimable curiosity a horned
cock but that its owner an avaricious old woman had her
domicile in the highlands scotland to which remote
region it would be necessary to travel amply provided with
the pecuniary means securing this wonderful bird and
that it would be expedient to set out immediately lest the
matchless phenomenon should become the prize a more
fortunate competitor
a horned cock the very acme frolicsome nature a
desideratum in the class lusus naturae which i would
rather possess than the mines peru away my dear
fellow speed like lightning to the north purchase this
precious bird at any price and should the old woman
hesitate at separation from her cornuted companion why then
purchase both and bring them to town with all possible
celerity
in the interval between this important mission and the
achievement its object the anxiety the virtuoso was
inexpressible a horned cock it was the incessant subject
 his cogitations by day and his dreams by night at
last the auspicious moment arrived in the still noontide 
night the preconceived rap at the street door announced the
happy result the momentous expedition the virtuoso
sprang from his couch with extasy to admit the illustrious
prodigy nature his astonishment delight and triumph
were unspeakable two horns the most beautiful curvature
adorned the crested head this noble northern
anticipation thus blessed by the fulness fruition the
bringer was superabundantly rewarded next morning the
virtuoso sent a message to each his most highly favoured
friends desiring attendance at his house instantaneously
on an occasion vast importance gentlemen said he to
his assembled visitants i may now boast possession that
which will astonish the universe a horned cock behold the
rara avis and envy my felicity so saying he uncovered a
wicker basket when lo the bird shorn its honours
indignant at confinement and struggling for freedom had
dropped its waxen antlers the unfortunate virtuoso stood
aghast and speechless and only at last found utterance to
curse his own credulity
 pursuing their course along the city road the two friends were
attracted by the appearance a caravan stationary on the road side
whereon was inscribed in large characters the female salamander
here is another instance observed dashall the varieties real
life in london
walk in gentlemen exclaimed the proprietor and see the surprising
young woman over whom the element fire has no control
tom and bob accepted the invitation entering the caravan they were
received by an interesting young female apparently not more than
eighteen years age with a courteousness manner far beyond what
could have been expected from an itinerant exhibitor
so soon as a sufficient number spectators had congregated within the
vehicle the female salamander commenced her exhibition
taking a redhot poker from the fire she grasped it firmly and drew
it from head to point through her hand without sustaining the smallest
injury
 will you permit me to look at your hand asked dashall
the girl extended her hand the palm was moist and seemed to have
been previously fortified against danger by some secret liquid or
other application now reeking from its recent contact with the flaming
weapon
an uncivilized bumpkin accused her deception asserting that the
poker was not heated to the extent represented
touch and try answered the girl he did so and the cauterizing
instrument gave a feeling although not very satisfactory negative to
his assertion
the mystery continued dashall resisting the impression 
tire certainly originates in the liquid by which your hand has been
protected
i shall answer your observation said the salamander by another
performance
she then dipped her fingers into a pot molten lead and let fall
upon her tongue several drops the metallic fluid to the no small
amazement and terror the company and as if to remove the idea 
precautionary application she after a lapse five minutes repeated
the same extraordinary exhibition and finally immerged her naked feet
in the boiling material
the inscrutable means by which the salamander executed these feats with
the most complete success and safety were not to be divulged and as
neither our respectable friends felt desirous emulating the fair
exorbitant they declined the importunity further inquiry
this is indeed said dashall as they resumed their walk the age
 wonders here is a girl who can bear to gargle her mouth with melted
lead put her delicate feet into the same scalding material and pass
through her hands a flaming redhot poker i am inclined to believe
that were the present an age superstition she might be burnt for a
witch were she not happily incombustible for my own part i sincerely
hope that this pyrophorous prodigy will never think quitting her own
country and as i am a bachelor i verily believe i should be tempted to
make her an offer my hand could i flatter myself with any chance
 raising aflame or making a match with such uninflammable commodity
only conceive the luxury when a man comes home fatigued and in a hurry
for his tea having a wife who can instantly take out the heater
for the urn with her fingers stir the fire with ditto snuff
candles with ditto make a spit her arm or a toasting fork her
thumb what a saving too at the washing season since she need only
hold her hand between the bars till it is redhot thrust it into a
box iron and iron you off a dozen children's frocks while an ordinary
laundress would be coddling the irons over the fire spitting upon them
and holding them to her cheek to ascertain the heat before she began to
work
and observed the squire taking up his friend's vein humour if
the young lady be as insensible to the flames cupid as she is to
those vulcan she might still be highly useful in a national point 
view and well worthy the attention the various fireoffices
exactly so replied his cousin how desirable for instance would it
have been at the late alarming fire in gracechurchstreet to have had
a trustworthy person like her who could very coolly perambulate
the blazing warehouses to rescue from the flames the most valuable
commodities or lolling astraddle upon a burning beam hold the redhot
engine pipe in her hand and calmly direct the hissing water to
those points where it may be most effectually applied in our
various manufactories what essential services she might perform
in glasshouses for instance it is notorious that great mischief
sometimes arises from inability to ascertain when the sand and flint
have arrived at the proper degree fusion how completely might thisbe
remedied by merely shutting up the female salamander in the furnace
and i can really imagine nothing more interesting than to contemplate
her in that situation dressed in an asbestos pelisse watching the
reproduction a phoenix hung up in an iron cage by her side fondling
a sprite little salamander and bathing her naked feet in the vitreous
lava to report upon the intensity heat much more might be urged
to draw the attention government to the propriety retaining this
antiignitible young lady not only for the benefits she may confer upon
the public but for the example she may afford to others her own
sex that by a proper exertion courage the most ardent sparks may be
sometimes encountered without the smallest inconvenience or injury
 indulging in this playful vein raillery they now reached
that part the city road intersected by the regent's canal where its
spacious basin circumjacent wharfs and warehouses and winding line 
water with barges gliding majestically on its placid wave where lately
appeared open fields arrayed in the verdure nature afforded full
scope for remark by mr dashall on the gigantic design and rapid
accomplishment by commercial enterprize the most stupendous
undertakings
this work incalculable public utility said mr dashall sprang
into being with the alacrity enchantment the same remark may
apply to every other improvement this vast metropolis so rapid in
execution that one thinks the wonderful lamp and the magnificent
palace aladdin erected in one night by the attendant genii
onwards towards merry islington here said dashall is the new
river this fine artificial stream is brought from two springs at chad
well and am well in hertfordshire for the supply london with water
it was finished in by sir hugh middleton a citizen london who
expended his whole fortune in this public undertaking the river withall
its windings is nearly miles in length it has sluices
and bridges over and under it a great number brooks and
watercourses have their passage in some places this canal is carried
through vales and in others through subterraneous passages it
terminates in a basin called the new river head close by from the
reservoir at islington the water is conveyed by main pipes underground
along the middle the principal streets and thence by leaden
pipes to the different houses thus by means the new river and
 the london bridge waterworks every house in the metropolis is
abundantly supplied with water at the expense each a few shillings
only per annum
 thus all through merry islington
these gambols he did play
john gilpin
this village islington is a large and populous place superior
both in size and appearance to many considerable towns in the country
observe the angel inn celebrated for its ordinary where you may
enjoy after a country ramble an excellent dinner on very moderate
terms apropos the angel inn ordinary some years ago it was
regularly every sunday attended by a thin meagre gaunt and bony
figure cadaverous aspect who excited amongst the other guests no
small degree dismay and not without cause denominated the wolf he
justified his pretensions to the appellation by his almost incredible
powers gormandizing for a quantum viands sufficient for six men
 moderate appetite would vanish on the magic contact his knife and
fork in the twinkling an eye in fact his voracity was considered
 boundless extent for he invariably and without cessation consumed
by wholesale so long as eatables remained on the table one day after
having essentially contributed to the demolition a baron beef and
devoured an entire shoulder lamb with a commensurate proportion 
bread roots vegetables c he pounced with the celerity a hawk
on a fine roast goose which unfortunately happened to have been just
then placed within the reach his annihilating fangs and in a very
short space time it was reduced to a skeleton having occasion for a
few minutes to leave the room the company in the meanwhile secreted the
bones the goose the waiter now entered for the purpose removing
the cloth casting his eyes round the room he seemed absorbed in
perplexity what is the matter asked one the company do you miss
arty thing yes sir the bones a goose why then you may save
yourself the trouble further search the gentleman just gone out
 modest manners and puny appetite has devoured the goose bones and
all the waiter lost no time in reporting the appalling fact to
his master who now more than ever was desirous getting rid the
glutton but how it was impossible to exclude him the ordinary or set
bounds to his appetite the only resource left was that buying him
off which was done at the rate one shilling per diem and the wolf
took his hebdomadary repast at a different ordinary from this also his
absence was purchased at the same rate as by the first speculating on
his gluttony he levied similar contributions on the proprietors the
principal ordinaries in the metropolis and environs and if the fellow
is still living i have no doubt his continuing to derive his
subsistence from the sources already described now what think you 
real life in london
 the wolf so denominated was less censurable for his
gluttony than the infamous purpose to which he applied it
otherwise he had a parallel in a man sublime genius
handel one day entered a tavern in the city and ordered six
mackay you are right to a letter the
sphinx is a monsterman and i sure enough am a munsterman
i know it what would'st thou sir felix o'o'grady
 the baronet felt surprised by this familiar recognition his
person and replied by observing that as the inquirer so well knew his
name he might also be acquainted with the nature his business
i partly guess it rejoined the seer and although i cannot
absolutely predict restitution thy lost property yet i foresee that
accident will throw the depredator in thy way when the suit may perhaps
find its way back to thy wardrobe now hence to thy business and i to
mine
the baronet having nothing further to ask withdrew accordingly and our
squire melvillehall was next ushered into the sanctum sanatorium 
bob was at a loss what to say not having prepared himself with any
reasonable pretext inquiry a silence a few moments was the
consequence and the squire having first reconnoitred the person the
conjurer who was arrayed in the appropriate costume his profession
scrutinized the apartment when the attention the visitor and visited
being again drawn to each other the soothsayer addressed himself to
tallyhoho in the following words
the shadows joy shall the mind appal
and the deathlight dimly flit round the hall
 him by base lucre who led astray
shall age into fruitless minion betray
the deathlight shall glimmer in melvillehall
and childless the lord the mansion fall
a wife when he weds vain ugly and old
though charms she brings forty thousand in gold
the squire was not prone to anger but that this fellow should interfere
with his private concerns and impute to him the intention forming a
most preposterous connexion under the influence avarice roused him
into a whirlwind passion rascal he exclaimed who take upon
you to predict the fate others are you aware your own vagabond
imposter here i grasp you nor will i quit my hold until i surrender
you into the hands justice and suiting the action to the word he
seized and shook the unfortunate seer to the manifest discomposure 
his bones who loudly and lamentably cried out for assistance alarmed
by the clamour dashall and the baronet rushed up stairs to whom the
squire stated the aggravation received and at the same time
his determination to bring the cheat to punishment the trembling
culprit sued for mercy conscious that he was amenable to correction asa
rogue and vagabond and if convicted as such would probably be sent
to expiate his offence in the treadingmill at brixton a place 
atonement for transgression which all others he dreaded the most
 unionhall hannah tompkins a miserable woman the
town was brought before r g chambers esq charged with
having robbed another the unfortunate class her
clothes it appeared that the prisoner had been liberated
from brixton prison on fridaylast after a confinement 
three weeks and that on coming out she was met by the
complainant catherine flynn by whom she was taken to a
comfortable lodging supplied with necessaries and treated
with great kindness the prisoner acted with propriety until
monday night during which she remained out in the streets
on tuesday morning at four o'clock she came home drenched
with rain the complainant desired her either to go to bed
or to light a fire and dry her clothes the prisoner did
neither and the complainant went to sleep at about seven
the latter awoke and missed her gown petticoat and
bonnet the prisoner was also missing the complainant
learned that her clothes were at a pawnbroker's shop where
they had been left a short time before by the prisoner
hall the officer having heard the robbery went inquest
 the prisoner and found her in a ginshop in
blackmanstreet in a state intoxication he brought her
before the magistrates in this condition her hair was
hanging about her face which was swelled and discoloured by
the hardship the preceding night she did not deny that
she had stolen the clothes her poor benefactress but she
pleaded in her excuse that the condition her body from
the rain monday night was such that nothing but gin
could have saved her life and the only way she had 
getting that medicine was by pledging natty flynn's
clothes the magistrates asked the prisoner whether she had
not got enough the treadingmill at brixton the prisoner
begged for mercy's sake not to be sent to the treadingmill
she would prefer transportation for it was much more
honourable to go over the water than to be sent as a rogue
and vagabond to brixton she was sent back to prison it is
a remarkable fact that since the famous treadingmill has
been erected at brixton the business this office has
greatly declined the mill is so constructed that when a
man ventures to be idle in it he receives a knock on the
head from a piece wood which is put there to give them
notice what they ere to do
 the two ancient sybil from the lower regions having now
ascended the scene confusion united their voices with that the
astrologer and dashall and sir felix also interceding in his behalf
the squire yielded to the general entreaty and promised the soothsayer
forgiveness on condition that he disclosed the source whence he
derived information as to the baronet's family concerns the soothsayer
confessed that he had elicited intelligence from the servant who
in his simplicity had revealed so much his master's affairs as to
enable him the conjurer to sustain his reputation even with sir felix
himself whom from description he recognized on his first entrance and
by the same means and with equal ease identified the person the
squire melvillehall he added besides that he had frequently by
similar stratagem acquired intelligence that chance had more than once
favoured him by verifying his predictions and thus both his fame and
finances had obtained aggrandisement he now promised to relinquish
celestial for sublunary pursuits and depend for subsistence rather on
the exercise honest industry than on public credulity
thus far had matters proceeded when the baronet's servant thady was
announced the triumvirate anticipating some extraordinary occurrence
desired the soothsayer to resume his functions and give the valet
immediate audience while they retired into another apartment to wait
the result in a few minutes the servant was dismissed and the party
readmitted
chance said the augured has again befriended me i told you sir
felix that the depredator would be thrown in your way my prediction is
realized he has been accidentally encountered by your servant and is
now in safe custody
on this information our party turned homewards first leaving the
astrologer a pecuniary stimulation to projected amendment life
there seems nothing inherent vileness said the squire as they
walked onwards in this man's principles he may have been driven
by distress to his present pursuits and i feel happy that i did not
consign the poor devil to the merciless fangs the law as in the
moment irritation i had intended
by my conscience exclaimed sir felix i cannot discover that he
ought to be punished at all he has been picking up a scanty living by
preying on public credulity and from the same source thousands in this
metropolis derive affluent incomes and with patronage and impunity
 and added dashall in cases minor offence a welltimed
clemency is frequently both in policy and humanity preferable to
relentless severity
 as k to the wardrobe its rightful owner
this business happily concluded and the day not much beyond its
meridian the three friends again sallied forth in the direction
 bondstreet towards piccadilly as usual the loungers were
superabundant and ridiculous paired together and swerving continually
from the direct line it required some skilful manoeuvring to pass
them our friends had surmounted several such impediments when a new
obstruction to their progress presented itself a party exquisite
had linked themselves together and occupied the entire pavement
so that it was impossible to precede them without getting into the
carriageway thus greatly obstructing and inconveniencing all other
passengers lounging at a funeral pace and leaving not the smallest
opening it was evident that these effeminate animals had
purposely united themselves for public annoyance sir felix irritated
by this palpable outrage on decorum stepped forward with hasty
determined stride and coming unexpectedly and irresistibly in contact
broke at once the concatenated barrier to the great amusement as
well as accommodation the lookerson and total discomfiture the
exquisite who observing the resolute mien and robust form their
assailant not forgetting a formidable piece timber alias sprig
 shillaleagh which he bore in his hand prudently consulted their
safety and forbore resentment the interruption
 if in walking the streets london the passenger kept
the right hand side it would prevent the frequent
recurrence much jostling and confusion the laws the
road are observed on the carriageway in the metropolis most
minutely else the street would be in a continual blockade
but
the laws the road are a paradox quite
that puzzles the marvelling throng
for if on the left you are yet on the right
and if you are right you are wrong
the baronet's two associates very much approved his spirited
interference and dashall observed that these insignificant beings
whom sir felix had so properly reproved were to be seen thus
incommoding the public in all parts the metropolis but more
particularly westward that in crowded streets however for instance
in the direct line from charing cross to the royal exchange the
apparent exquisite are generally thieves and pickpockets who find
a harvest in this extensive scene business by artful depredation
either upon the unwary tradesman or equally unsuspecting passenger
whose wiper or tattler and sometimes both becomes the frequent produce
 their active ingenuity
the morning had been wet and although the flagway was dry yet the
carriageroad was dirty there are in all parts the metropolis
indigent objects both sexes who by sweeping the crossway pick up
an eleemosynary livelihood it not unfrequently happens however that
a chariot or other vehicle is drawn up at one the crossway
directly athwart it so as completely to intercept your way to the
pavement exactly so situated were our pedestrians they had availed
themselves a newly swept path and were advancing towards the
opposite side in piccadilly when before they could effect
their purpose a carriage drew up and effectually impeded further
progress by the crossway so that there seemed no alternative between
standing fast and gaining the pavement by walking through the mud the
coachman retained his position despite remonstrance and in this
laudable stubbornness he was encouraged by a wellattired female inside
the vehicle for the carriage was a private one and its illmannered
inmate probably a lady rank and fashion sir felix justly indignant
at this treatment set danger and inconvenience at defiance and
deliberately walking to the horses heads led the animals forward until
the carriage had cleared the crossway maugre the threats the lady
and the whip the coachman who had the audacity to attempt exercising
it on the person the baronet when tallyhoho dreading the consequences
to the rash assailant sprang upon the box and arresting his hand
saved the honour munster the transaction did not occupy above two
minutes yet a number people had collected and vehemently applauded
sir felix and the lady's companion now hastily reentering the chariot
from an adjacent shop mr jehu drove off rapidly amidst the hoots and
hisses the multitude
 sir felix had not heard the following incident else he
certainly would have followed its example
two ladies distinction stopped in a carriage at a
jeweller's near charingcross one them only got out and
the coach stood across the pathway which some gentlemen
wanted to cross to the other side and desired the coachman
to move on a little the fellow was surly and refused the
gentlemen remonstrated but in vain during the altercation
the lady came to the shop door and foolishly ordered the
coachman not to stir from his place on this one the
gentlemen opened the coachdoor and with boots and spurs
stepped through the carriage he was followed by his
companions to the extreme discomposure the lady within
as well as the lady without to complete the jest a party
 sailors coming up observed that if this was a
thoroughfare they had as much right to it as the penmen
and accordingly scrambled through the carriage
the poor streetsweeper having applied to sir felix for a mite
 benevolence and is it for letting the carriage block up the
crossway and forcing me through the mud asked the baronet but
whether or not i have not got any halfpence about me so that i must
pay you when i come again ah your honour exclaimed the man it
is unknown the credit i give in this way sir felix thrust his hand
into his pocket and rewarded the applicant with a tester
 proceeding along piccadilly our party were followed by
a newfoundland dog which circumstance attracted the notice the
baronet to whom more than to either his associates the animal seemed
to attach itself pleased with its attention sir felix caressed it and
when the triumvirate entered a neighbouring coffeehouse the dog was
permitted to accompany them scarcely had the three friends seated
themselves when a man decent appearance came into the room and
without ceremony accused the baronet having by surreptitious means
obtained possession his property in other words having inveigled
away his dog and demanding instant restitution
sir felix fired at the accusation divested as it was the shadow 
truth yet unsuspicious design would have instantly relinquished his
canine acquaintance but for the interposition dashall who suspected
this intrusive personage to be neither more nor less than a dogstealer
 whom there are many in london continually on the alert for booty
these fellows pick up all stray dogs carry them home and detain them
until such time as they are advertised and a commensurate reward is
offered by the respective owners if then the dog is intrinsically
 no value and consequently unsaleable the adept in this species 
depredation finding he can do no better takes the dog home
receives the promised reward and generally an additional gratuity in
compensation keep and trouble but should it so happen that the
proffered remuneration is not equivalent to the worth the animal the
conscientious professor knavery carries his goods to a more lucrative
market at the instance dashall therefore sir felix was determined
to retain the animal until the claimant brought irrefragable proof
 ownership the fellow blustered the baronet was immovable in his
resolution when the other threw off all disguise and exhibiting
himself in pristine blackguardism inundated sir felix pertained rose like
many others the children industry from comparative indigence to
affluence and from obscurity to eminence
the party was select the dinner was sumptuous yet unostentatious and
the conversation if not exactly in the first class refinement was
to the two strangers interestingly instructive as embracing topics 
mercantile pursuit with which they had hitherto been unacquainted it
was also highly enlivened by the sprightly sallies three beautiful
and elegantly accomplished young ladies the daughters the amiable
host and hostess and to these fair magnets attraction whom dashall
happily denominated the graces our gallant cavaliers were particularly
assiduous in their attentions the party broke up after an evening 
reciprocal enjoyment and dashall on the way home expressed his belief
that with the solitary exception one colossal instance ignorance
and brutality the very respectable man in society is most generally
to be found among the merchants london
 the very respectable man is the true representative 
the commercial character great britain he possesses more
information than the dutch trader and more refinement than
the scotch manufacturer with all the business
qualifications either he is shrewd industrious manly
and independent and as he is too much in earnest for the
slightest affectation he shews his character in his dress
his carriage and his general appearance his dress is at
once plain and neat and if his coat should accidentally
exhibit the cut a more genteel manufacturer the
interstice between his boot he wears top boots and smallclothes
the fashion his cravat which is rolled round a
stiffer two inches in diameter and tied in a bow besides
a variety other more minute characteristics decidedly
refute all suspicion an attempt at attaining the
appearance a man fashion the a spitalfields
silkhandkerchief just appearing from the pocket hole at the
top his skirt shews at once his regard for good things
and native manufactures while the dignity his tread
declares his consciousness his own importance the
importance a very respectable man and to attribute it
to any other than such an honest pride would be
derogatory to his reputation and feelings if he meets a
business acquaintance an higher rank than his own his
respectful yet unembarrassed salutation at once sufficiently
expresses the disparity their two conditions and his
consciousness the respectability his own while the
respectfully condescending notice the peer exhibits the
reversed flow the same feelings the very respectable
man is always accurately acquainted with the hackney coach
fares to the different parts london and any attempt at
imposition on the part the coachman is sure to be
detected and punished he is never to be caught walking to
the bank on a public holiday and the wind must have shifted
very fast indeed if it should happen to be in the north
when he believes it to be in the south the state the
stocks is familiar to him and as he watches their
fluctuations with an attentive eye their history for weeks
or even for months is often in his memory the very
respectable man is always employed but never in a hurry
and he perhaps is never better pleased than when he meets a
congenial friend who interrupts the current business by
the introduction a mutual discussion some important
failure mr suchaone's rapid acquirement fortune the
rise or fall the funds c all which the causes or
consequences are importantly whispered or significantly
prophesied at home the government the very respectable
man's family is arbitrary but the governor is not a tyrant
his wife has not like the woman fashion any distinct
rights but she enjoys extensive indulgences she has
power but it flows from him and though she is a
responsible she is not a discretional agent the table is
to correspond with the moderation the master and the
matron will be scolded or reproved as it varies from the
proper medium between meanness and profusion
the very respectable man is never less in his element than
when he is in the centre his wife's parties for here he
must resign the reins into her hands and alas there is no
such character as the very respectable woman all our women
would be women fashion and in dress and expense in the
numbers their card tables and the splendour their
parties in every thing but manners they are here at his
own fireside the very respectable man may be considered as
not at home till a rubber a genial rubber which is
provided him as soon as possible renders him blind to the
folly and deaf to the clamour the scene the very
respectable man shews to least advantage as a politician
as his opinions are derived less from reading than
experience they are apt to be dogmatical and contracted in
political philosophy he is too frequently half a century
behind his age is still in the habit considering specie
as wealth and talks loudly the commercial benefits 
the late war such is the very respectable man a
character decidedly inferior to that many individuals in
the class society immediately above him but which
considered as the character a class appears to be
superior at once to that above and that below it on a
comparison with that above too it more than makes up in the
mass its virtues for the deficiency in their quality and
appears to be like solon's laws if not the very best that
might be at least the best which the state society
admits in the lower orders the social character is in its
mineral state in the higher the fineness the gold is
prejudicial to its durability in the very respectable manit
is found mixed with some portion alloy but in
greater quantity and adapted to all the uses and purposes
for which it is designed as a civil member society if
his theoretical politics are defective the advantages
derived to society from his industry and integrity more
than counterbalance those defects in his theory as a
religious member society if his religion might be more
refined if his attendance at church is considered rather asa
parochial than a spiritual duty and his appearance in his
own pew is at least as much regarded as his devotions there
the regularity his attendance the harmony his
principles and practice his exemplary manner filling his
different relations more than make up for the inferiority
in the tone his religion the commercial and religious
capital society are in short continually advancing by
his exertions though they don't advance so fast as they
otherwise would if those exertions were directed by more
intellect
chapter xxiv
vainly bountiful nature shall fill up life's measure
if we're not to enjoyment awake
churls that cautiously filtrate and analyze pleasure
deserve not the little they take
i hate all those pleasures where angling and squaring
and fitting and cutting by rules
and me dear me i beg pardon for swearing
all that follow such fashions are fools
for let who may be undone
i say life in london
 pleasure's the prop and the staff
that sets ev'ry muscle
in a comical bustle
and tickles one into a laugh

the long protracted visit to vauxhall being at length finally arranged
our party soon found themselves in the midst this gay and fascinating
scene amusement
these charming gardens said the hon tom dashall which you may
perhaps have some recollection upon a masquerade occasion having
lately fallen into new hands have assumed under their direction and
management a new appearance additional splendour and magnificence
perhaps scarcely ever surpassed and the present proprietors appear to
have studied the comfort and gratification their visitors as well as
their own advantage but this we shall be better judges before the
night is spent
right replied sparkle i am not fond far fetched descriptions
which may upon investigation prove to have originated more in the
imagination the author than in reality to exist
at all events continued tom the gardens themselves are beautiful
and extensive and contain a variety walks which if but tastefully
illuminated and attended by rank fashion and beauty can never fail
to be attractive
 our heroes rushed forward to the splendid scene enchantment
which had drawn forth the previous observations mingling with the
crowds well dressed persons who like themselves were upon the alert
to witness this delightful place summer amusement in the new form
which it has recently assumed the veranda tastefully festooned with
painted canvass the brilliantly illuminated orchestra and the animated
countenances the company conspired to produce an effect almost
inconceivable while new objects delight were continually bursting
upon their view the illuminated colonnade newly decorated with carved
and painted flowers fruit and foliage and mr singleton's original
whole length transparent portrait his majesty in his coronation
robes alternately attracted attention as well as the four cormorants
constructed in various parts the gardens consisting some very
pretty views the new exchange at paris scenes in switzerland c in
the musical department sparkle was much pleased to find some the old
favourites particularly mr charles taylor and mrs bland as well as
with the performance a miss grafton who possesses a rich voice
with considerable power and flexibility and madame georgia an
east indian lady who afterwards sung very charmingly in the rotunda
accompanying herself on the piano forte in a style which proved her to
be a most skilful performer
but the grand subject their admiration was what is rather affectedly
called the heptaplasiesoptron or fancy reflective proscenium which
is placed in the long room fronting the orchestra the rotunda
it is entirely lined with looking glass and has in all probability
originated in the curious effect produced by the kaleidoscope and the
looking glass curtains lately exhibited at our theatres this splendid
exhibition is fitted up with ornamented draperies and presents a
fountain real water illuminated revolving pillars palm trees
serpents foliage and variegated lamps and the mirrors are so placed
as to reflect each object seven times this novelty appeared to excite
universal admiration inspiring the company with ideas refreshing
coolness the bubbling water the waving the foliage and the
seven times reflected effulgence the lamps gave the whole an
appearance enchantment which sets all description at defiance
 having taken a complete circle through this round delights
interrupted only by the congratulations and inquiries friends the
appointed hour for exhibiting the fireworks arrived when they were
additionally gratified by a display the most splendid description
and the famous ascent a la saqui was admirably executed by longuemarc
after witnessing which they quickly retired to a box where they gave
directions for supper it is but justice to say that upon this being
furnished they found the refreshments to be the best quality and
supplied upon moderate terms the wines by the london wine company and
the viands by mr waste
about two o'clock in the morning our friends took their departure
from this romantic spot after an excursion fraught with pleasure and
delight
on the following morning sparkle received a letter from merrywell
with information the death his uncle and his succession to
the estate having arrived just in time to prevent his decease without a
will this was a subject exultation to all the party though to none
more so than sparkle particularly as the estate alluded to was situated
in the neighbourhood his own residence
merrywell said dashall will become a gay fellow now as he will
have ample means as well as inclination which i know he has never been
wanting to sport his figure in good style without resorting to any
scheme to keep the game alive
true said sparkle without crossing and jostling and if he has
his own good in view he will reside chiefly in the country choose
an amiable partner for life and only pay a visit to the metropolis
occasionally for to live in this land temptations where you can
hardly step across the way without getting into error must be baneful
in effect to a young man like him an ardent mind what say you
friend tallyhoho
i confess replied bob that i entertain thoughts very similar
to yours besides i apprehend that our old friend merrywell has had
sufficient experience himself to admit the justice your observation
 pshaw rejoined dashall you are getting completely
unfashionable what can be more bang up than a life in london high life
and low life shake the castor tip the flash and nibble the blunt
look for instance at young lord lappet cares for nothing all blood and
spirit fire and tow up to every thing and down as a hammer
his is a general case replied sparkle and is only one among
numerous others to prove that many the disorders which are daily
visible in high life may be traced to the education or rather the want
 education the youthful nobility and gentry it would be a shocking
and insupportable degradation to send a sprig fashion to school among
common boys where probably he might learn something really useful no
no he must have a private tutor who is previously instructed to teach
him nothing more than what will enable him to pass muster as not quite
a fool under this guidance he skims over a few authors almost without
reading and at all events without knowing what they have written
merely with a view to acquaint him that there were once such persons inexistence
after which this tutor accompanies him to one the public
schools westminster harrow or eton where the tutor writes his
thesis translates the classics and makes verses for him as well ashe
is able in the new situation the scholar picks up more the
frailties the living than he does the instructions departed
characters the family connections and the power purse with which
the students are aided embolden them to assume an unbounded license
and to set at complete defiance all sober rules and regulations and it
may be justly remarked that our public seminaries are admirably situated
for the indulgence their propensities for instance westminster
school is fortunately situated in the immediate neighbourhood a
famous place instruction called tothill vulgarly tuttle fields
where every species refined lewdness and debauchery and manners the
most depraved are constantly exhibited consequently they enjoy the
great advantages learning the slang language and hearing prime
chaunts rum glees and kiddy catches in the purest and most bang up
style he has likewise a fine opportunity contracting an unalterable
penchant for the frail sisterhood blue ruin milling cock fighting
bull and badger baiting donkey racing drinking swearing swaggering
and other refined amusements so necessary to form the character an
accomplished gentleman
 again harrow school is happily so near to the metropolis as
to afford frequent opportunities for occasional visits to similar scenes
 contagion and fashionable dissipation that the scholars do not fail
to seek advantages taking lessons in all those delectable sciences
eton it is true is somewhat farther removed from the nursery 
improvement but it is near enough to windsor which place it is not
necessary to say much for their bacchanalian and cyprian orgies and
other fashionable festivities are well known so that notwithstanding
they are not in the immediate vicinity the metropolis there can
scarcely be a doubt their being able to sport their figures to
advantage whenever they are let loose upon society
cambridge is but a short distance from that place sporting
notoriety newmarket consequently it is next to impossible but that a
youth an aspiring mind should be up to all the manoeuvres a racecourse
understanding betting hedging off crossing and jostling
sweating and training know all the jockeys how to give or take the
odds lay it on thick and come it strong some have an unconquerable
ambition to distinguish themselves as a whip sport their tits in tiptop
style and become proficient in buckish and sporting slang to
pitch it rum and astonish the natives up to the gab the cad they
take upon themselves the dress and manners the garment club yet
noted for the appearance their prays and the dexterity with which
they can manage the ribbons and like goldfinch pride themselves on
driving the long coaches mount the box tip coaches a crown dash
along at full speed rattle down the gateway take care your
heads never kill'd but one woman and a child in all my life that's
your sort
fine pictures a university education said tom but sparkle always
was a good delineator real character and there is one thing to be
said he has been an eye witness the facts nay a partaker the
sports
true continued sparkle and like many others have had something
like enjoyment in them too
aye aye no doubt that said bob dryly but how does it happen
that you have omitted oxford altogether
 nay said sparkle there is not much difference in any 
them the students hate all learning but that which they acquire in the
brothel the ring or the stable
they spend their terms somehow or other in or near the university and
their vacations at jackson's rooms in london so that they know nothing
more mathematics than sufficient to calculate odds and chances this
however depends upon the wealth the parties for notwithstanding
there are some excellent statutes by which they ought to be guided
a nobleman or wealthy commoner is indulged according to his titles or
riches without any regard to the rules and regulations in such cases
made and provided
from this situation they are at length let loose thoroughly
accomplished in every thing but what they ought to know some make their
appearance as exquisite or dandies a sort indescribable being if
being such things may be called others take the example the bang
ups make themselves perfect in milling swearing greeting talking
flash and mail coach driving until john doe and richard roe drive them
into abbot's preserve a circumstance which puts a temporary check upon
the sports though if the collegian is but up to the logic he is very
soon down upon the coves his creditors bowls them out by harassing
expenses and walks out himself up to snuff and fly
 bowls them out by harassing expenses a proof the
power which has been exercised under the existing insolvent
debtor's act will be found in the following extract from a
daily paper
an unfortunate debtor was opposed in the insolvent debtors
court for having resisted particular creditors with
vexatious law proceedings sham pleas c the public is not
generally aware the extent to which such vexatious
resistance can be carried in the investigations that have
taken place before a committee the house commons on
the subject insolvent debtors mr thomas clarke at the
time clerk the court stated that in a debtor's he
found a paper wherein it was pointed out to debtors how to
harass creditors he had heard he said that it was sold
from one prisoner to another in a printed form for d
each that witness then delivered to the committee a 
from which the following extract was read it is extracted
from the parliamentary report
law proceedings when arrested and held to bail and after
being served with a declaration you may plead a general
issue which brings you to trial the sooner any plea that
you can put in but if you want to vex your plaintiff put
in a special plea and if in custody get your attorney to
plead in your name which will cost you l s your
plaintiff l as expenses if you do not mean to try the
cause you have no occasion to do so until your plaintiff
gets judgment against you he must in the term after you
put in a special plea send what is termed the paper 
which you must return with s d otherwise you will not
put him to half the expenses when he proceeds and has
received a final judgment against you get your attorney to
search the office appointed for that purpose in the temple
and when he finds that judgment is actually signed he must
give notice to the plaintiff's attorney to attend the master
to tax his costs at which time your attorney must have a
writ error ready and give it to the plaintiffs attorney
before the master which puts him to a very great expense
as he will have the same charges to go over again the writ
 error will cost you l s if you want to be further
troublesome to your plaintiffs make your writ error
returnable in parliament which costs you l s and your
plaintiff should he have the courage to follow you
through all your proceedings then file a bill in the
exchequer which will cost about l or l and if he
answers it it will cost him sol more after this you may
file a bill in chancery which will cost about l and if
he does not answer this bill you will get an injunction
and at the same time an attachment from the court against
him and may take his body for contempt court in not
answering your last bill you may file your bill in the
court chancery instead the exchequer only the latter
costs you the least if you are at any time served with a
copy a writ take no further notice it than by keeping
it when you are declared against do not fail to put in a
special plea immediately and most likely you will hear no
more the business as your plaintiff will probably not
like to incur any further expense after having been at so
much
thus a creditor may be put to an expense three hundred
and fourteen pounds by a debtor for the small cost l
s and all because the laws allowed him to sue for his
own and if he and his attorney do not keep a sharp lookout
the creditor may get committed for contempt court
 i perceive said tom that your imagination is flying
away from your subject though i admit the justice your remarks as
generally applicable to what is termed the higher ranks society
and that they are imitated or aped in succession to those the lower
orders but we appear to have imperceptibly got into a long descriptive
conversation instead pursuing our usual plan drawing inferences
from actual observation let us toto get in with now my masters you please and seems quite as much
at home as mr matthews at the lyceum with all that sort thing and
every thing in the world he is however not singular in his taste
for many our hereditary statesmen are to be found among this class
save and except that he carries his imitations to a farther extent than
any person i ever knew and it is a fact that he had one his foreteeth
punched out in order to enable the noble aspirant to give the
true coachman's whistle and to spit in a jehulike manner so as to
project the saliva from his lips clear the cattle and traces into
the hedge on the near side the road
accomplishments that are truly deserving the best considerations a
noble mind rejoined tallyhoho
and absolutely necessary to the finished gentleman the present day
 course continued sparkle and as i have not had a lounge in these
corinthian regions for some little time i am glad to be thus furnished
with a key to characters that may be new to me
there is one on the opposite side the way not altogether new as he
has made some noise in the world during his time i mean the gentleman
whose features exhibit so much the rouge it is the celebrated sir
george skippington formerly well known in fop's alley and at the
opera not so much on account his elegant person lively wit
or polished address as for his gallantries and an extraordinary
affectation dress approaching very nearly to the ridiculous the
chief part his reputation being derived from wearing a peagreen
coat and pink silk stockings he has however since that time become
a dramatic writer or at least a manufacturer pantomime and shew
and ah but see speaking writers here we have a hook from which
is suspended a certain scandalous journal well known for its dastardly
attacks upon private character and whose nominal conductors are at this
moment in durance vile but a certain affair in the fashionable way 
defaulting has brought him down a peg or two his ingenuity has been
displayed on a variety occasions and under varying circumstances
his theatrical attempts have been successful and at harrow he was
called the green man in consequence his affected singularity 
wearing a complete suit clothes that colour he appears to act
at all times upon the favourite recommendation young rapid keep
moving for he is always in motion in consequence which it is said
that lord byron wittily remarked he certainly was not the green man
and still
 the green man and still in the well known sign a
pubichouse in oxford road
 why cried bob there seems to be as little still life
about him just now as there is about hookey walker but pray who is
that dingy gentleman who passed us within the last minute and who
appeared to be an object attraction to some persons on the opposite
side he appears to have been cut out for a tailor
that replied tom is a baronet and cornet who married the handsome
daughter a great marquis she however turned out a complete
termagant who one day in the heat her rage d d her rib fora
sneaking puppy dashed a cup coffee in his face and immediately
after flew for protection to a noble lord who entertained a penchant
for her this however proved to be a bad speculation on her part and
having seriously reflected on the consequences such conduct she made
her appearance again at her husband's door a few nights afterwards and
in the spirit contrition sought forgiveness under a promise never
transgressing any more little doubting but her claim to admission would
be allowed here however it seems she had reckoned without her
host for the baronet differing in opinion would not listen to her
proposition her entreaties and promises were urged in vain and the
deserted though still care sposa has kept the portals his door as
well as the avenues to his heart completely closed to her since
at this moment they were interrupted by the approach a gaily dressed
young man who seizing dashall by the hand and giving him a hearty
shake exclaimed
ha my dear fellow what dashall and as i live mr sparkle you are
there too are you d me what's the scent up to any thing going
any where or any thing to do eh d me
quite ad libitum replied dashall happy to see gayfield well and
in prime twig allow me to introduce my cousin robert tallyhoho esq
you do me proud my dear fellow any thing new can't live without
novelty who's up who's down what's the wonder the day how does
the world wag where is the haven destination and how do you weather
the point
 zounds replied tom you ask more questions in a breath than
we three can answer in an hour
never mind don't want you to answer but at all events must have
something to say hate idleness either in speech or action hate talking
in the streets can't bear staring at like a new monument or a statue
talking statues i have it good thought go see achilles the
ladies man eh what say you d me made cannons and other
combustibles waterloo to wit come along quite a bore to standstill
yea or nay can't wait
with all my heart said sparkle twitching dashall by the arm it
is quite new since my departure from town and joining arms they
proceeded towards the park
been out town continued gayfield thought so lost you all
at once glad you have not lost yourself any thing new in the
country always inquire can't live without novelty go to see everything
and every body every where nothing new in the papers irish
distresses old but very distressing for a time how the devil can you
live in the country can't imagine
and i apprehend replied sparkle it will be little use to
explain for a gentleman so much information as yourself must know
every thing
good but severe never mind i never trouble my head with other
people's thoughts always think for myself let others do as they like
hate inquisitive people don't choose to satisfy all inquirers never
ask questions any one don't expect answers have you seen the
celebrated ventriloquist alexandre the egyptian tomb the 
sparkle could hold no longer the vanity and egotism this everlasting
prater this rambler from subject to subject without manner method
or even thought was too much and he could not resist the temptation to
laugh in which he was joined by tom and bob
 what is the matter inquired gayfield unconscious being
the cause their risibility i see nothing to laugh at d me
but i do love laughing so i'll enjoy a little with you at all events
and immediately he became a participator in their mirth to the
inexpressible delight his companions but continued he i see
nothing to laugh at and it is beneath the character a philosopher to
laugh at any thing
never mind said dashall we are not that description and we
sometimes laugh at nothing which i apprehend is the case in the present
instance
i perfectly agree with the observation rejoined sparkle it is a
case in point and very well pointed too
nothing could be better timed said tallyhoho
what than a horse laugh in the public streets d d vulgar
reallyquite outre as we say no no you ought to consider
where you are what company you are in and never laugh without a good
motive what is the use laughing
a philosopher said tom dashall need scarcely ask such a question
the superiority his mind ought to furnish a sufficient answer
then i perceive you are not communicative and i always like to be
informed but never mind here we shall have something to entertain us
and at least said sparkle that is better than nothing
the observation however was lost upon the incorrigible fribblerm although that
term is universally applied to it inasmuch as this statue
is not naked the modest artist having at the suggestion 
these modest ladies taken the precaution giving achilles
a covering similar to that which adam and eve wore on their
expulsion from eden
 the attitude the statue is so questionable as to have
already raised many opposite hypotheses as to what it is
really intended to represent mr exsheriff perkins has
with very laudable ingenuity and classical taste
discovered that the figure is nothing more nor less than a
syne or running groom just such a one the worthy exsheriff
adds as used to accompany him in india when
engaged in a hunting party and who when he grew tired
used to lay hold the exsheriff's horse's tail in order
to keep up with his master the author the travestie
however has hit upon another solution the attitude
still more novel and equally probable namely that 
dancing for which he expects to gain no inconsiderable
share popularity
 without a shirt or highland skirt it is really
entertaining to see what a refinement criticism has been
displayed upon the defects this incomparable statue some
have abused the hero for being shirtless and said it was an
abomination to think that a statue in a state nudity
much larger than life too should be stuck up in hyde
park where every lady's eye must glance however repugnant
it might be to their ideas modesty but did not the
ladies themselves order and pay for the said statue is it
not an emblem their own pure taste then as for
putting on achilles a kelt or short petticoat called by the
poet a highland skirt oh shocking i it is not only
unclassical but it would have destroyed the effect the
thing altogether to be sure it would not be the first time
that achilles wore a petticoat for if we are rightly
informed his mother thetis disguised him in female
apparel and hid him among the maidens at the court 
lycomedes iu order to prevent his going to the siege 
troy but that wicked wag ulysses calling on the said
maidens to pay his respects discovered mister achilles
among them and made him join his regiment
each widow's heart is throbbing
each married lady sobbing
while little miss
would fain a kiss
be from achilles robbing
then oh the sight entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
oh tis not helm or feather
or breeches made leather
that gave delight
by day or night
or draw fair crowds together
let those wear clothes who need em
adorn but max with freedom's
then light or dark
they'll range the park
and follow where you lead em
for oh the sight's entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
 if we could only insert one hundredth part what has
been said by widows wives and maids on this interesting
subject during the present week we are quite sure our
readers would acquit us having overcharged the picture
or even faintly delineated it
 we certainly must differ with the author here in our
humble opinion helmets feathers leather breeches c
have a wonderful effect in drawing crowds the fair sex
together at a grand review for instance
 this line it is hoped will be understood literally the
words are t moore's and breathe the spirit liberty not
licentiousness
 having succeeded in their object dashall and his cousin
pursued their course homeward and thus terminated another day spent in
the development real life in the british metropolis
but still the muse beseeches
if this epistle reaches
achilles bold
in winter cold
that he would wear his breeches
for though in sultry weather
he needs not cloth nor leather
yet frosts may mar
what's safe in war
and ruin all together
but still the sight's entrancing
to see achilles dancing
without a shirt
or highland skirt
where ladies eyes are glancing
 the last verse must be allowed to be truly considerate
nay kind that the ladies will be equally kind and
considerate to poor achilles as the poet is must be the
wish every one who has witnessed the perilous situation
in which he is placed
 achilles was a great favourite with the ladies from his
very birth he was a fine strapping boy and his mother was
so proud him that she readily encountered the danger 
being drowned in the river styx herself that she might dip
her darling in it and thereby render him invulnerable
accordingly every part the hero was safe except his
heel by which his mother held him amidst the heat 
battle and like his renowned antitype the immortal duke
 wellington he was never wounded but at length when
achilles was in the temple treating about his marriage with
philomela daughter priam the brother hector let fly
an arrow at his vulnerable heel and did his business in a
twinkling
we cannot quit this subject without paying a compliment to the virtues
 the court we understand there has not been one royal carriage seen
in the park since the erection the statue and if report speaks true
the marchioness c m's delicacy is so shocked that she intends to
quit hamilton place which is close by as early as a more modest site
can be chosen
chapter xxv
lack a day what a gay
what a wonderful great town
in each street thousands meet
all parading up and down
crossing jostling strutting running
hither thither going coming
hurry scurry pushing driving
ever something new contriving
oh what a place what a strange london town
on every side both far and wide we hear its renown

escorting to the evervarying promenade fashion the hon tom dashall
and his cousin bob whose long protracted investigation life in
london was now drawing to a close proceeded this morning to amuse
themselves with another lounge in bondstreet this arcadia dignified
equality was thronged the carriageway with dashing equipages and
the pave with exquisite pedestrians here was one rouged and whiskered
there another in petticoats and stays while his sister like an amazon
shewed her nether garments half way to the knee then passed smiling
by a corinthian bear in an upper benjamin and a jolliffe shallow a
noted milliner shone in a richer pelisse than the countess whom the day
before she had cheated out the lace which adorned it the gentleman
with the dayrule in new buckskins and boots and mounted on a
thoroughbred horse quizzed his retaining creditor as he trotted along
with dusty shoes and coat the lady easy virtue stared her keeper's
wife and daughter out countenance the man milliner's shopboy enpassant
 jogged the duke's elbow and the dandy pickpocket lisped and
minced his words quite as well as my lord
tom pointed out some the more dashing inhabitants and bob inquiring
the name a fine woman rather en bon point with a french face who
was mounted on a chesnut hunter and whom he had never before seen in
the his was mrs sullivan's story and she told it with such
pathos that all who heard it pitied her except her
husband
it was now mr sullivan's turn to speak whilst his wife was
speaking he had stood with his back towards her his arms
folded across his breast to keep down his choler biting his
lips and staring at the blank wall but the moment she had
ceased he abruptly turned round and curiously enough
asked the magistrate whether mistress sullivan had done
speaking
she has replied his worship but suppose you ask her
whether she has any thing more to say
i shall sir exclaimed the angry mr sullivan mistress
sullivan had you any more it to say 
mrs sullivan raised her eyes to the ceiling clasped her
hands together and was silent
very well then he continued will i get lave to spake
your honour
his honour nodded permission and mr sullivan immediately
began a defence to which it is impossible to do justice so
exuberantly did he suit the action to the word and the
word to the action och your honour there is something
the matter with me he began at the same time putting two
 his fingers perpendicularly over his forehead to
intimate that mrs sullivan played him false he then went
into a long story about a misther burke who lodged in his
house and had taken the liberty assisting him in his
conjugal duties without any lave from him at all at all
it was one night in particular he said that he went to bed
betimes in the little back parlour quite entirely sick with
the headache misther burke was out from home and when the
shop was shut up mrs sullivan went out too but he didn't
much care for that only he thought she might as well have
staid at home and so he couldn't go to sleep for thinking
 it well at one o'clock in the morning he continued
lowerking his voice into a sort loud whisper at one
o'clock in the mornking misther burke lets himself in with
the key that he had and goes up to bed and i thought
nothing at all but presently i hears something come tap
tap tap at the street door the minute after comes down
misther burke and opens the door and sure it was mary
mistress sullivan that is more's the pity and devil a bit
she came to see after me at all in the little back parlour
but up stairs she goes after misther burke och says but
there's something the matter with me this night and i got
up with the nightcap o th head me and went into the
shop to see for a knife but i couldn't get one by no manes
so i creeps up stairs step by step step by step here
mr sullivan walked on tiptoe all across the office to show
the magistrate how quietly he went up the stairs and when
i gets to the top i sees em by the gash gas coming
through the chink in the window curtains i sees em and
och mistress sullivan says he and och misther burke
says she and och botheration says i to myself and what
shall i do now we cannot follow mr sullivan any farther
in the detail his melancholy affair it is sufficient
that he saw enough to convince him that he was dishonoured
that by some accident or other he disturbed the guilty
pair whereupon mrs sullivan crept under mr burke's bed
to hide herself that mr sullivan rushed into the room and
dragged her from under the bed by her wicked leg and
that he felt about the round table in the corner where mr
burke kept his bread and cheese in the hope finding a
knife
and what would you have done with it if you had found it
asked his worship
is it what i would have done with it your honour asks
exclaimed mr sullivan almost choked with rage is it what
i would have done with it only that i'd have digged it
into the heart em at the same time as he said this he
threw himself into an attitude wild desperation and made
a tremendous lunge as if in the very act slaughter
to make short a long story he did not find the knife
mr burke barricaded himself in his room and mr sullivan
turned his wife out doors
the magistrate ordered him to find bail to keep the peace
towards his wife and all the king's subjects and told him
that if his wife was indeed what he had represented her to
be he must seek some less violent mode separation than
the knife
there not being any other case interest tom and bob left
the office not however without a feeling commiseration
for mr sullivan whose frail rib and her companion in
iniquity now that the tables were turned against them by
the injured husband's plain unvarnished tale experienced
a due share reprobation from the auditory
 pursuing their course homeward through st jamessquare
who have we here exclaimed tom as i live no other than the
lofty honoris an authoress a wit and an eccentric a combination
 qualities which frequently contribute to convey the possessor to a
garret and thence to an hospital or poor house it is not uncommon to
find attic salt in the first floor from heaven but rather difficult
to find the occupier enabled to procure salt whereby to render porridge
palatable the lady honoris who has just passed resides in a lodging
in marylebone she having mistaken stature for beauty and attitude
for greatness a tune on her lute for fascination a few strange
opinions and out the way sayings for genius a masculine appearance
for attraction and bulk for irresistibility came on a cruise to london
with a view to call at c house where she conceived she might be
treated like a princess
she fondly fancied that a certain dignified personage who relieved her
distress could not but be captivated with the very description her
in consequence which she launched into expenses which she was but
ill able to bear and now complains designs formed against her and 
all sorts fabulous nonsense it must however be acknowledged that
an extraordinary taste for fat has been a great somce inconvenience
to the illustrious character alluded to for corpulent women have been
in the habit daily throwing themselves in his way under some pretence
or other and if he but looked at them they have considered themselves
as favourites and in the high road to riches and fame
it is well known that a certain french woman with long flowing black
hair who lived not an hundred miles from publico was one who fell into
this error her weight is about sixteen stone and on that account she
sets herself down as this illustrious person's mistress nay because he
saw her once she took expensive lodgings ran deeply in debt and now
abuses the great man because he has not provided for her in a princely
style pour se beaux yeux for it must be admitted that she can boast
as fine a pair black eyes as ever were seen the circumstance 
this taste for materialism is as unfortunate to the possessor as a
convulsive nod the head once was to a rich gentleman who was never
without being engaged in some law suit or other for lots knocked down
to him at auctions owing to his incessant and involuntary nodding at
these places the fat ladies wish the illustrious amateur to pay for
peeping just as the crafty knights the hammer endeavoured to make
the rich gentleman pay for his nodding at them
fat fair and forty then said sparkle does not appear to be
forgotten
 no was the reply nor is it likely the wits london are
seldom idle upon subjects importance take for instance the following
lines
when first i met thee fat and fair
with forty charms about thee
a widow brisk and debonair 
how could i live without thee
thy roguish eye i quickly spied
it made me still the fonder
i swore though false to all beside
from thee i'd never wander
but old fitly now
thought only fit to tease me
and c m i vow
has learnt the art to please me
by this time they were passing grosvenor gate when the hon tom dashall
directed the attention his cousin to a person on the opposite side 
the street pacing along with a stiff and formal air
that said he is a new species character if it may properly be
so termed which i have never yet given you any account sir edward
knoweth stands however at the head a numerous and respectable class
 persons who may be entitled philosophic coxcombs he proceeds with
geometrical exactness in all his transactions you can perceive finery
 dress is no mark his character on the contrary he at all times
wears a plain coat and as if in ridicule the common fop takes care
to decorate his menials in the most gorgeous liveries
the stiffness and formality his appearance is partly occasioned by
the braces which he very judiciously purchased martin van butcher
and partly by the pride wealth and rank
there is a pensiveness in his aspect which would induce any one to
imagine sir edward to be a man feeling but those who have depended
upon outward appearances alone have found themselves miserably
deceived for as hypocrisy assumes a look sanctity so your
philosophic coxcomb's apparent melancholy serves only as a mask to cover
his stupidity
sir edward is amorously inclined but he consults his reason or
pretends to do so and by that means renders his pleasures subservient
to his health it cannot be denied he sometimes manifests contortions 
aspect not exactly in unison with happiness but his feelings are ever
selfish and his apparent pain is occasioned by the nausea a debauch
or perhaps by the pressure a new pair boots if you are in
distress sir edward hears your tale with the most stoical indifference
and he contemplates your happiness with an equal degree apathy a
sort epictetus who can witness the miseries a brother without
agony or sympathy and mark the elevation a friend without one
sentiment congratulation wrapt up in self he banishes all feeling
for others
 this philosopher has a great number imitators perhaps not
less than one thousand philosophic coxcombs visit london annually and
if sir edward were to die they might all with great propriety lay claim
to a participation in the property he might leave behind him as near
relations to the family the knolls these gentlemen violate all the
moral duties life with impunity they are shameless irreligious
and so insignificant that they seem to consider themselves born for
no useful purpose whatever indeed they are such perfect blanks in the
creation that were they transported to some other place the community
would never miss them except by the diminution follies and vices
like poisonous plants they merely vegetate diffuse their contagious
effluvia around then sink into corruption and are forgotten for ever
whip me such fellows through the world exclaimed sparkle i have no
relish for them
on calling in at long's hotel they were informed that sparkle's servant
had been in pursuit his master in consequence letters having
arrived from the country and as dashall knew that he had two excellent
reasons why he should immediately acquaint himself with their contents
the party immediately returned to piccadilly
chapter xxvi
mark the change at very first vacation
she's scarcely known to father or relation
no longer now in vesture neat and tight
because forsooth she's learn'd to be polite
but crop't a bosom bare her charms explode
her shape the tout ensemble alamode 
why bet cries pa what's come to thee late
this school has turn'd thy brain as sure as fate
what means these vulgar ways i hate em wench
you shan't i tell thee imitate the french
because great yokes adopt a foreign taste
and wear their bosoms naked to the waist
d'ye think you shall no no i loathe such ways
mercy great notes shew all for nothing now days

the morning arose with smiles and sunshine which appeared almost to
invite our party earlier than they intended to the enjoyments a plan
which had occupied their attention on the previous evening when sparkle
proposed a ride which being consented to the horses were prepared and
they were quickly on the road
passing through somers town sparkle remarked to his friend dashall
that he could not help thinking that the manners and information the
rising generation ought to be greatly improved
and have you not had sufficient evidence the fact was the reply
why certainly continued sparkle if the increase public schools
round the metropolis is in proportion to what has already met my
eye during our present short ride there is sufficient evidence that
education is considered as it ought to be the first importance yet
i question whether we are so much more learned than our ancestors as
to require such a vast increase teachers nay is not the market
overstocked with these heads seminaries similar to the republic 
letters which is overwhelmed with authors and clogged with bookmakers
and books
 this remark replied tom might almost as well be made upon
every trade and profession which is followed in the present day there
are so many in each that a livelihood can scarcely be obtained and a
universal grumbling is the consequence
well said bob i can with safety say there are but two trades or
callings that i have met with since my arrival in london to which i
have discovered no rivalship
this remark from tallyhoho excited some surprise in the mind his two
friends who were anxious to know to what he alluded
i mean continued he the doll's bedstead seller who is frequently
to be heard in the street london bawling with a peculiarity 
voice as singular as the article he has for sale buy my doll's
bedsteads and the other a well known whistler whom you must both
have heard
egad you are right replied sparkle and although i recollect them
both i must confess the observation now made has never so forcibly
struck me before it however proves you have not exhausted your time
in town without paying attention to the characters it contains nor the
circumstances by which they obtain their livelihood and although
the introduction is not exactly in point with the subject previous
remarks and ought not to cut the thread our discourse it has some
reference and conveys to my mind a novel piece information but i
was about to consider what can be the causes for this extraordinary
host ladies all ages classes and colours from the honourable
mistress to the misses stubbs who have their establishment for
the education young ladies in a superior style and whether inconsequence
 this legion fair labourers in learning and science
our countrywomen for i am adverting particularly to the softer sex are
chaster wiser and better than their mammas and grandmammas
a most interesting subject truly replied tom and well worthy 
close investigation now for my part i apprehend that the increase 
tutors arises from many other causes than the more general diffusion 
knowledge
 there can be no doubt it continued sparkle and some
 those causes are odd enough very opposite to wisdom and not more
conducive to improvement for amongst them you will find pride poverty
and idleness
for instance you may discover that the proud partner a shopkeeper
in the general line or more plainly speaking the proprietor a
chandler's shop is ambitious having her daughter accomplished
e'en good geoffrey forge a blacksmith by descent
who has his life midst bars and hammers spent
resolves his bet shall learn to read and write
and grace his table with a wit polite
to make for father's sense a reparation
the day arrives for fatal separation
when betsey quits her dad with tears woe
and goes to boardingschool at publico
well the accomplishments sought are music dancing french and
ornamental work instead learning the bible being brought up to
domestic utility cooking washing plain work and the arithmetic
necessary for keeping the accounts her father's shop what is the
consequence the change in her education quite unfits miss for her
station in life makes her look down on her unlettered pa and ma as
persons too ignorant for her to associate with while she is looking
up with anxious expectation to marry a man fortune probably an
officer and is not unfrequently taken unceremoniously without the
consent her parents on a visit to the church
you are pushing the matter as close as you can charles said dashall
though i confess i think nay i may say indeed i know some instances
in which such fatal consequences have been the result the conduct to
which you allude
well then suppose even that this superior style education should
not have the effect turning the poor girl's head and that she really
has prudence and discretion enough to avoid the perils and snares 
ambition miss celestina is at least unfitted for a tradesman's wife
and she must either become a companion or a governess or a teacher
at a school or be set up as the minerva an evening school half
educated herself and exposed in every situation for which she is
conceived to be fitted to numerous temptations betwixt the teachers
 waltzes and quadrilles the one horse chaise dancingmasters the
laxmorale foreign musicmaster or the dashing pa her young pupils
perhaps a peer celibacy is not always so much an affair choice as
 circumstances and sad difficulties are consequently thrown in the
way poor miss so and so's path through life all originating from
pride
 well said bob since you have been amusing us with
this description i have counted not less than eight seminaries
establishments and preparatory schools
i do not doubt it continued sparkle and some them on the meanest
scale notwithstanding the high sounding titles under which they are
introduced to public notice others presided over by sister spinsters
not unfrequently with frenchified names such for instance as
mesdames guerdon's seminary the lady's real name being martha or
if you please patty burton and a deformed relative completing
the mesdames the misses de la porte whom nature had made simple
porter and no great catch to obtain either the misses cox's
preparatory school for young gentlemen an early age all seem
to bespeak the poverty false pride and affectation the owners
notwithstanding the fine denominations given to some these learned
institutions such as bellevue seminary montpelier house bel
retiro boarding school c c
to such artifices as these are two classes females compelled to
resort namely reduced gentlewomen and exalted tradesmen's daughters
who disdain commerce and hate the homely station which dame nature had
originally intended them to move in such ladies either by birth or
adoption prefer the twig to the distaff the study to the shop and
experience more pleasure in walking out airing with their pupils taking
their station in the front frequently gaudily and indiscreetly dressed
than to be confined to the counter or the domestic occupations the
good old english housewife former times
such ladies are frequently to be met with on all the greens and
commons from dirty stephen or retinal to the more sumptuous clapham or
wollaston some them are so occupied with self that the randomshot
glances their pupils at the exquisite and the dandy militaires about
town do not come within the range their notice while others are
more vigilant but often heave a sigh at the thought that the gay and
gallant captain should prefer the ruddy daughter a cheesemonger to
the reduced sprigs gentility which they consider themselves
 at all events many these ladies and worthy ones too are
placed par force poverty in this avocation unsuited to their
abilities their hearts their habits or their former expectations the
government their young flock is odious to them and although they may
go through the duties their situation with apparent patience it is
in fact a drudgery almost insupportable and the objects nearest the
governess's heart are the arrival the vacation the entrancemoney
the quarter's schooling and a lengthy list items the arrival 
black monday or a cessation holidays brings depressed spirits and
she returns to her occupation deploring her unlucky stars which placed
her in so laborious a situation envies her cousin sarah who has
caught a minor in her net nay even perhaps would be happy to exchange
circumstances with the thoughtless miss skipwell who has run away with
her dancingmaster or ruined a young clergyman a serious turn by
addressing loveletters to him copied from the most romantic novels
which have softened his heart into matrimony and made genteel beggars
 the reverend mistress himself and a numerous offspring
very agreeable indeed cried dashall
perhaps not said tallyhoho interrupting him to the parties
described
you mistake me was the reply i meant the combination air and
exercise with the excellent descriptions our friend sparkle who by
the way has not yet done with the subject
i am aware it continued sparkle for there is one part which i
mentioned at the outset which may with great propriety be added in the
way elucidation i mean idleness it is the third and shall for
the present be the last subject our consideration and even this has
contributed its fair proportion teachers to the world miss mel ta
way the daughter a tallowchandler who ruined himself by dressing
extravagantly his wife and over educating his dear caroline matilda
in consequence which he failed and shortly afterwards left the world
altogether was brought up in the straw line but this was no solid
trade and could not be relied upon however she plays upon the harp
and the guitar what advantages yet she also failed in the strawhat
line and therefore idleness prefers becoming an assistant teacher
and music mistress to taking to any more laborious even though more
productive mode obtaining a livelihood
 then miss nugent has a few hundred pounds the remnant 
pa's gleanings pa having been the retired butler a pigeons peer a
retail bookseller sought her hand in marriage but she thought him
quite a vulgar fellow he had no taste for waltzing at which she was
considered to excel he blamed her indulgence in such pleasures and
ventured to hint something about a pudding then again he can't speak
french and dresses in ditties now all this is really barbarous and
consequently miss nugent spurns the idea such a connection
let us trace her still further in a short time she is addressed by a
captain kirkpatrick tyrconnel who makes his approaches with a splendid
equipage the romantic sound the former and the glare the latter
attract her attention the title captain however is merely a nom
de guerre for he is only an ensign on halfpay miss is delighted with
his attentions he is a charming fellow highly accomplished for he
sings duets waltzes admirably plays the german flute and interlards
his conversation with scraps french and spanish altogether he is
truly irresistible and she is willing to lay her person and her few
hundreds at the feet the conquerer the day is appointed and every
preparation made for the nuptial ceremony when ah who can foresee
the various turns fate below
an athletic hibernian wife formerly the widow dennis o'drumball
steps in between the young lady and the hymeneal altar and claims the
captain as her husband she being the landlady a country alehouse
where he had been quartered whom he had married by way discharging
his bill the interposition is fortunate because it saves the captain
from an involuntary trip to botany bay and miss from an alliance 
a organical kind though it has at the same time proved a severe
disappointment to the young lady
crossed in love wounded in the most tender part she forswears the
hymeneal tie and under such unfortunate circumstances she opens a
seminary to which she devotes the remainder her life
 pray said bob whose eyes were as open as his ears did you
notice that shining black board with preposterous large gold letters
announcing miss smallgood's establishment for young ladies and close
alongside it another informing the passenger that mantraps were
placed in the premises
i did said sparkle but i do not think that though somewhat
curious the most remarkable or strange association young ladies
educated on an improved plan and mantraps advertised in order to
create terror and dismay for connected with this method announcing
places education is a recollection receptacles another
nature
to what do you allude inquired tallyhoho why in many instances
private madhouses are disguised as boarding schools under the
designation establishment many these receptacles in the
vicinity the metropolis are rendered subservient to the very
worst purposes though originally intended for the safety the
individual as well as the security the public against the commission
 acts which are too frequently to be deplored as the effect 
insanity all the houses mourning that to which poor unhappy
mortals are sent under mental derangement is decidedly the most gloomy
the idea strikes the imagination with horror which is considerably
increased by a reflection on the numerous human victims that are
incarcerated within their walls the discipline they are subjected
to and the usual pecuniary success which attends the keepers such
establishments where the continuance the patient is the chief
source interest rather than the recovery that they are useful
in some cases cannot be denied but there are many instances too well
authenticated to be doubted where persons desirous getting rid 
aged and infirm relatives particularly if they manifested any little
aberration mind as is common in advanced age have consigned them
to these receptacles from which through the supposed kindness 
their friends and the management the proprietors they have never
returned if the parties ail nothing they are soon driven to insanity
by ill usage association with unfortunates confined like themselves
vexation at the treatment and absolute despair escape or if
partially or slightly afflicted the lucid intervals are prevented
and the disorder by these means is increased and confirmed by coercion
irritation mind and despair
 this is a deplorable picture the state things indeed
said tallyhoho
but it is unvarnished was the reply the picture requires no
imaginary embellishment since it has its foundation in truth then
again contrast the situation the confined with the confined the
relatives have an interest in the care the person and a control over
the property which in cases death frequently becomes their own
the keepers these receptacles have also an interest in keeping the
relatives in a disposition to forward all their views retaining the
patient who under the representation being seriously deranged is
not believed consequently all is delusion but the advantages which
ultimately fall to the tenderhearted relative or the more artful
proprietor the madhouse and it is wonderful what immense fortunes
are made by the latter nay not only by the proprietors but even
the menials in their employ many whom have been known to retire
independent a circumstance which clearly proves that by some means or
other they must have possessed themselves the care the property
as well as that the persons their unfortunate victims
this is a dull subject said dashall though i confess that some
exposures which have been made fully justify your observations but i am
not fond looking at such gloomy pictures real life
true replied sparkle but it connects itself with the object you
have had in view and though i know there are many who possess souls
 sensibility and who would shrink from the contemplation so much
suffering humanity it is still desirable they should know the effects
produced almost by inconceivable causes i know people in general avoid
the contemplation as well as fly from the abodes misery contenting
themselves by sending pecuniary assistance but unfortunately there
are a number things that wear a similarity appearance yet are so
unlike in essence and reality that they are frequently mistaken by the
credulous and unwary who become dupes merely because they are not eyewitnesses
 the facts but if the subject is dull let us push forward
take a gallop over hampstead heath and return
 with all my heart cried dashall giving a spur to his horse
and away they went
the day was delightfully fine the appearance the country banished
all gloomy thoughts from their minds and after a most agreeable ride
they returned to piccadilly where finding dinner ready they spent
the remainder the evening in the utmost hilarity and the mutual
interchange amusing and interesting conversation principally
relative to sparkle's friends in the country and their arrangements for
the remainder their time during their stay in the metropolis
chapter xxvii
e'en mighty monarchs may at times unbend
and sink the dull superior in the friend
the jaded scholar his lov'd closet quits
to chat with folks below and save his wits
peeps at the world awhile with curious look
then flies again with pleasure to his 
the tradesman hastes away from care's rude gripe
to meet the neighbouring club and smoke his pipe
all this is well in decent bounds restrained
no health is injured and no mind is pain'd
but constant travels in the paths joy
yield no delights but what in time must cloy
though novelty spread all its charms to view
and men with eagerness those charms pursue
one truth is clear that by too frequent use
they early death or mis'ry may produce
 the post the following morning brought information for
dashall and his friends and no time was lost in breaking open the seals
 letters which excited the most pleasing anticipations a dead
silence prevailed for a few minutes when rising almost simultaneously
expressions satisfaction and delight were interchanged at the
intelligence received
merry well's success had proved more than commensurate with his most
sanguine expectations he had arrived at the residence his dying
relative just time enough to witness his departure from this sublunary
sphere and hear him with his expiring breath say all is thine and
a letter to each his former friends announced the pleasure and
the happiness he should experience by an early visit to his estate
declaring his determination to settle in the country and no more become
a rambler in the labyrinths london
this was a moment unexpected though hoped for gratification sparkle
applauded the plan he intended to pursue
tallyhoho confessed himself tired this world wonders and appeared
to be actuated by a similar feeling he conceived he had seen enough 
the life a rover and seemed to sigh for his native plains again
 dashall's relish for novelty in london was almost subdued and
after comparing notes together for a short time it was mutually agreed
that they would dine quietly at home and digest a plan for future
proceedings
never said tom did i feel so strong an inclination to forego
the fascinating charms a london life as at the present moment
and whether i renounce it altogether or not we will certainly pay a
congratulatory visit to merry well
example said sparkle endeavouring to encourage the feeling with
which his friend's last sentiment was expressed is at all times better
than precept and retirement to domestic felicity is preferable to
revelry in splendid scenes dissipation which generally leads to
premature dissolution
agreed said tom and happy is the man who like yourself has more
than self to think for blest with a lovely and amiable wife and an
ample fortune no man upon earth can have a better chance gliding
down the stream life surrounded by all the enjoyments it can
afford while i 
oh what a lost mutton am i
sparkle could scarcely forbear laughing at his friend though he was
unable to discover whether he was speaking seriously or ironically he
therefore determined to rally him a little
how said he why you are growing serious and sentimental all at
once what can be the cause this change opinion so suddenly
my views life replied dashall have been sufficient to convince
me that a like in london is the high road to death i have however
tried its vagaries in all companies in all quarters and as the song
says
having sown my wild oats in my youthful days i wish to live happily
now they are done
by this time sparkle was convinced that dashall was speaking the real
sentiments his mind and congratulated him upon them
 tallyhoho expressed himself highly delighted with the information
he had acquired during his stay in london but could not help at the
same time acknowledging that he had no wish to continue in the same
course much longer it was therefore agreed that on that day fortnight
they would leave the metropolis for the residence merrywell and
trust the future guidance their pursuits to chance
it would argue a want loyalty said tom if we did not witness the
royal departure for scotland before we quit town and as that is to take
place on saturday next we will attend the embarkation his majesty at
greenwich and then turn our thoughts towards a country life
sparkle was evidently gratified by this determination though he could
hardly persuade himself it was likely to be long duration and bob
inwardly rejoiced at the expression sentiments in exact accordance
with his own at a moment when they were all absorbed in thoughts 
the future they were suddenly drawn to the present by a man passing the
window bawling aloud buy a pray buy a pray
what does the fellow mean interrupted tallyhoho
mean said dashall nothing more than to sell his clothes props
props replied bob but he cries traps i suppose that is a new style
adopted in london
not at all continued sparkle the alteration sound only arises
from an habitual carelessness with which many what are termed the
london cries are given a sort tone or jargon which is acquired by
continually calling the same thing and in which you will find he is
not singular the venders milk for instance seldom call the article
they carry for sale as it is generally sounded mien or mien below 
though some have recently adopted the practice crying mien above 
the sort singsong style which the wandering venders different
goods get into as it were by nature is frequently so unintelligible
that even an old inhabitant the town and its environs can scarcely
ascertain by the ear what is meant and which i apprehend arises more
from the sameness subject than from any premeditated intention the
parties so calling other instances may be given the chimneysweeper
you will find instead bawling sweep frequently contracts
it to weep or eep the former not altogether incompatible with the
situation the shivering little being who crawls along the streets
under a load soot to the great annoyance the well dressed
passengers however it has the effect warning them his approach
the fustian above curtailment as if he felt his superiority over the
fluemaker lengthens his sound to dustho or dustwo besides he is
dignified by carrying a bell in one hand by which he almost stuns
those around him and appears determined to kick up a dust if he can
do nothing else the cries muffins in the streets it is difficult
to understand as they are in the habit ringing a tinkling bell
the sound which can scarcely be heard and calling mapping ho and
i remember one man whom i have frequently followed from whom i could
never make out more than happy happy happy now there is a man who
frequently passes through the strand wheeling a barrow before him
bawling as he moves along in a deep and sonorous voice smoaking hot
piping hot hot chelsea buns and another in the vicinity covent
garden who attracts considerable notice by the cry come buy my live
shrimps and pierriwinkles buy my wink wink wink these however are
exceptions to those previously mentioned as they have good voices
and deliver themselves to some tune but to the former may be added
the itinerant collector old clothes who continually annoys you
with chow chow sale the ingenious ned shute the most luxuriant
comedian his time frequently entertained his audience on his benefit
nights with admirable imitations the cries london in which he
introduced a remarkable little man who sold puffs and who from the
peculiar manner his calling them acquired the name golly molly
puff by this singularity he became a noted character and at almost
every period some such peculiar itinerant has become remarkable in the
streets london some years back a poor wretched being who dealt in
shreds and patches used to walk about inviting people by the following
lines
linen woollen and leather
bring em out altogether
 another a sleekheaded whimsical old man appeared who was
commonly called the wooden poet from his carrying wooden ware which
was slung in a basket round his neck and who chaunted a kind song in
doggerel rhyme somewhat similar to the following
come come my worthy soul
will you buy a wooden bowl
i am just come from the borough
will you buy a pudding stirrer
i hope i am not too soon
for you to buy a wooden spoon
i've come quick as i was able
thinking you might want a ladle
and if i'm not too late
buy a trencher or wood plate
or if not it's no great matter
so you take a wooden platter
it may help us both to dinner
if you'll buy a wooden skimmer
come neighbours don't be shy for i deal just and fair
come quickly come and buy all sorts wooden ware
very well indeed for a wooden poet exclaimed bois he certainly
deserved custom at all events his rivals walter scott or lord byron
would have turned such a poetical effusion to some account it would
have been dramatized murray hangman c would have been all in a
bustle puffing blowing and advertising we should have had piracies
chancery injunctions and the d to pay but alas it makes all
the difference whether a poet is fashionable and popular or not
 lord byron in his to a recent publication
complains that among other black arts resorted to for the
purpose injuring his fair fame he has been accused 
receiving considerable sums for writing poetical puffs for
warren's blacking we can safely acquit his lordship this
charge as well as plagiarism from the poems he alludes
to but it has led to a curious rencontre between the
blackinglaureat and his patron the vender the shinking
jet and after considerable blackguardian between the
parties the matter is likely to become the subject legal
discussion among the gentlemen the black robe
the poet it appears received half a crown for each
production from the man blacking which the latter
considered not only a fair but even liberal remuneration
for poetic talent not overlookking that while the
pecuniary reward would produce comfort and add a polish to
personal appearance the brilliance the composition
both poetry and blacking would be fairly divided
between he authors each and that the fame both would
be conjointly
handed down to posterity and shine for ever in the temple
 fame
now it requires no uncommon sagacity to perceive that but
for this unfortunate mistake the public the poet would
have remained satisfied as far as pecuniary recompence
went with the halfcrown looking to futurity for that
more complete recompence which poets ever consider far
beyond pudding or sensual gratification fame and
immortality but alas
from causes quite obscure and unforeseen what great events
to man may sometimes spring
finding from lord bs own statement that the public had
duly appreciated the merit these compositions and had
attached so high a value as even to mistake them for his
lordship's productions our bard was naturally led into a
train reasoning and logical deductions as to what
advantage had and what ought to have resulted to himself
according to this estimate by public opinion lord b and
his great northern contemporary it appeared received
thousands from the public for their poems while halfcrowns
not to be despised during certain cravings but soon
dissipated by that insatiable and unceasing tormentor the
stomach was all the benefit likely to accrue in this world
to the original proprietor in a happy moment a happy
thought flitted athwart the poet's mind and like the china
seller in the arabian nights he found himself rolling in
ideal wealth and spurning with disdain the blacking
merchant the blacking and the halfcrowns he resolved on
a project by which to realize his fondest wishes wealth
happiness and independence
the project was this to collect together the fugitive
blacking sonnets so as to form a volume under the title 
poems supposed to be written by lord byron and offer the
copyright to mr murray and in case his refusing a
liberal sum that is something approaching to what he
pays the noble bard per vol to publish them on his the
author's own account and depend on the public for that
support and encouragement which their favourable decision
had already rendered pretty certain
now then comes the rub the blacking vender hearing 
our poet's intention files a bill in chancery praying for
an injunction to restrain the publication and claiming an
exclusive right in the literary property the poet in
replication denies having assigned or transferred the
copyright and thus issue is joined his lordship with his
usual extreme caution where important rights are involved
wished to give the matter mature consideration and said
he would take the papers home to peruse more attentively
it will be recollected that in the cause respecting lord
byron's poem cain his lordship stated that during the
vacation he had by way relaxation from business perused
that work and paradise lost in order to form a just
estimate their comparative merits and who knows but
during the present vacation his lordship may compare the
blacking sonnets with child harold fare thee well
c and that on next seal day the public may be benefited
by his opinion as to which is entitled to the claim 
superior excellence and how far the public are justified in
attributing the former to the noble author the latter
 then continued sparkle there was a rustic usually mounted
on a white hobby with a basket on one arm who used to invade the
northern purlieus london mumbling holloway cheesecakes which from
his mode utterance sounded like ho all my teeth ake
ha ha ha vociferated tallyhoho unable to restrain his risibility
numerous other instances might be adduced continued sparkle among
many there was a noted pitman whose pigs were made what is called
standing crust three or four inches long baked with currant sauce in
the belly who used to cry or rather sing
a long tail'd pig or a short tail'd pig c
there was another singular character who used to be called teddydoll
a noted vender gingerbread at bartholomew southwark and other
fairs who to collect customers round his basket used to chaunt a song
in which scarcely any thing was distinctly articulated but the cant
expression teddydoll he used to wear a high cocked hat and feather
with broad scolloped gold lace on it and last though not least was
sir jeffrey dunstan garret fame who used to walk about the streets
in a blue coat with gold lace his shirt bosom open and without a hat
accompanied by his daughter miss nancy crying ould wigs
old wigs reverberated bob an extraordinary article merchandize
not more extraordinary than true replied dashall but come i
suppose we shall all feel inclined to write a few lines to the country
so let us make the best our time
upon this signal each flew to the exercise the quill and indulged
his own vein thought in writing to his friend and the day closed
upon them without any further occurrence deserving particular remark
chapter xxviii
haste away to scotland dear
and leave your native home
the land cakes affords good cheer
and you've a mind to roam
here splendid sights and gala nights
are all prepar'd for thee
while lords and knights amid gay delights
and ladies bend the knee
haste away to scotia's land
with kilt and highland plaid
and join the sportive reeling band
with ilia bonny lad
for night and day we'll trip away
with cheerful dance and glee
come o'er the spray without delay
each joy's prepared for thee

the morning arose with a smiling and inviting aspect and as it had been
previously rumoured that his majesty would embark from greenwich
hospital at halfpast eight o'clock on his intended voyage to scotland
our party had arranged every thing for their departure at an early hour
and before seven o'clock had seated themselves in a commodious and
elegant barge moored off westminster bridge intending if possible to
see the city companies headed by the lord mayor and court aldermen
start as had been proposed from the tower they were shortly
afterwards gliding on the surface the watery element towards the
scene action by this time the numerous parties in pursuit the
same object were on the alert and from almost every part the shore
as they passed along gaily dressed company was embarking while merry
peals bells seemed to announce approaching delight the steeples on
shore and the vessels in the river exhibited flags and streamers
which gave an additional splendour to the scene all was anxiety and
expectation numerous barges and pleasureboats laden with elegant
company were speeding the same way and every moment increasing so
that the whole view displayed a combination beauty fashion and
loyalty not often surpassed
 on arriving off the tower it was soon ascertained that
the lord mayor and city companies had got the start them and
consequently they proceeded on their journey not doubting but they
should overtake them before reaching greenwich and in this expectation
they were not disappointed for soon after passing rotherhithe church
they came up with the city state barge which was towed by a steamboat
accompanied by several other state barges the whole filled with
company the brightness the morning and the superb appearance 
these gaily manned and it might be added gaily woman gallies fora
numerous party fashionably attired ladies added their embellishing
presence to the spectacle formed altogether a picture more than
ordinary interest and magnificence
this royal visit to scotland said sparkle has for some time past
been a prevailing topic discussion from one the land cakes
to the other and the preparations for his majesty's reception are 
the most splendid description triumphal arches are to be erected new
roads to be made banquets to be given general illuminations to take
place body guards royal archers to be appointed and the dull light
 oil lamps to be totally obscured by the full blaze royal gas then
there are to be meetings the civil and municipal authorities from
every town and county presenting loyal and dutiful addresses and it is
expected that there will be so much booing among the carle's when the
king's come that the oilier are said to be not a whit disconcerted at
the introduction gas lights the unctuous article being at present
in great demand for the purpose suppling the stiff joints the
wouldbe courtiers who have resolved to give a characteristic specimen
 their humble loyalty and to oulboo all the hoping the famed sir
pertinax
however observed dashall it is not very likely they will be able to
equal the grace with which it is acknowledged the king can bow and he
is to be accompanied by the accomplished sir billy city notoriety
so that admirable examples are certain being presented to the
scottish gentry reports state that the worthy baronet who
is considered to be great weight wherever he goes is determined
to afford his majesty in this visit to edinburgh the benefit that
preponderating loyalty which he last year threw into the scale the
dublin corporation and that he has recently purchased from a highland
tailor in the hay market a complete suit tartan philebeg c with
which he means to invest himself as the appropriate costume to meet
his royal master on his arrival at edinburgh
in that case said sparkle there is one circumstance greatly to be
regretted considering the gratification which our northern neighbours
might have derived from ascertaining the precise number cats the
most weighty london citizens i remember reading a day or two back
that the weighhouse the city edinburgh was disposed by public
roup and that a number workmen were immediately employed to take it
down as the whole must be cleared away by the th august under a
penalty l what a pity that in the annals the weighhouse the
scotch could not have registered the actual weight the greatest 
london aldermen
tom and bob laughed heartily at their friend sparkle's anticipations
respecting the worthy baronet while bob dryly remarked he should
think sir willie would prove himself a bonnie lad among the lasses o
and nae doubt he would cut a braw figure in his highland suit
but continued dashall we are indulging in visions fancy without
paying that attention to the scene around us which it deserves and i
perceive we are approaching greenwich hospital there is the royal yacht
ready prepared for the occasion the shores are already crowded with
company and the boats and barges are contending for eligible situations
to view the embarkation there is the floating chapel and a little
further on to the right is the marine society's schoolship for the
education young lads for his majesty's service the hospital now
presents a grand and interesting appearance what say you suppose we
land at the three crowns and make inquiry as to the likely time his
majesty's departure
with all my heart replied sparkle and we can then refresh for i am
not exactly used to water excursions and particularly so early in the
morning consequently it has a good effect on the appetite
 by this time the city barges had taken positions in the front
 the hospital and our party passed them to gain the proposed place
 inquiry here however all was conjecture the people greenwich
hospital appeared to know as little the time appointed as those 
the metropolis and finding they had little chance accommodation inconsequence
 the great influx company they again embarked
and shortly after attacked the produce their locker and with an
excellent tongue and a glass madeira regaled themselves sufficiently
to wait the arrival time however hung heavily on their hands though
they had a view thousands much worse situated than themselves
and could only contemplate the scene with astonishment that serious
mischiefs did not accrue from the immense congregated multitude by
which they were surrounded
anxiety and anticipation were almost exhausted and had nearly given
place to despondency when about three o'clock the extraordinary bustle
on shore announced the certainty the expected event being about to
take place and in about half an hour after they were gratified by
seeing his majesty descend the steps the hospital attended by the
noblemen c under a royal salute and rowed to the vessel prepared to
receive him the royal standard was immediately hoisted and away sailed
the king amidst the heartfelt congratulations and good wishes his
affectionate and loyal people the firing cannon the ringing 
bells and every other demonstration a lively interest in his safety
and welfare leaving many to conjecture the feelings with which the
heart must be impressed a person so honoured and attended we shall
select a few descriptive lines from the pen a literary gentleman
in his opinion the most likely to be expressive the sentiments
entertained on the occasion
royal recollections
as slow the yacht her northern track
against the wind was cleaving
her noble master oft look'd back
to that dear spot twas leaving
so loth to part from her he loves
from those fair charms that bind him
he turns his eye where'er he roves
to her he's left behind him
when round the bowl other dears
he talks with joyous seeming
his smiles resemble vapourish tears
so faint so sad their beaming
while memory brings him back again
each early tie that twin'd him
how sweet's the cup that circles then
to her he's left behind him
ah should our noble master meet
some highland lass enchanting
with looks all buxom wild and sweet
yet love would still be wanting
he'd think how great had been his bliss
if heav'n had but assign'd him
to live and die so pure as this
with her he's left behind him
as travelers oft look back at eve
when eastward darkly going
to gaze upon that light they leave
still faint behind them glowing
so ere he's been a month away
at home we sure shall find him
for he can never longer stay
from her he's left behind him
the gay assemblage before them and the ceremony the embarkation the
sound music and the shouts the populace and animated appearance
 the river which by this time seemed all in motion amply repaid our
friends for the time they had waited and after watching the departure
 the royal squadron they returned to town and as they passed the
london docks it occurred to the mind the hon tom dashall that his
cousin had not yet paid a visit to these highly interesting productions
 human genius and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to their
inspection before his departure from the metropolis
chapter xxix
where has commerce such a mart
so rich so throng'd so drained and so supplied
as london opulent enlarged and still
increasing london babylon old
not more the glory the earth than she
a more accomplish'd world's chief glory now

according to arrangements previously made our friends met in the
morning with a determination to shape their course eastward in order to
take a survey the commercial docks for the accommodation shipping
and the furtherance trade and the carriage being ordered they were
quickly on their way towards blackwell
the docks the port london said the hon tom dashall are 
the highest importance in a commercial point view and are among the
prominent curiosities british commerce as they greatly facilitate
trade and afford additional security to the merchants
yes said sparkle and it is to be presumed no small profit to the
shareholders the companies by which they were established but i
expect your cousin will derive more gratification from a sight the
places themselves than from any description we can give and the
time to explain will be when we arrive on the spot for it is scarcely
possible for any one to conceive the immensity buildings they
contain or the regularity with which the business is carried on how
do ye do thrusting his head out the window and moving his hand
with graceful familiarity i have not seen sir frederick since my
matrimonial trip and now he has passed by on horseback i really believe
without seeing me dashall you remember sir frederick forfeit
perfectly well replied tom but i was paying so much attention to
you that i did not notice him the liveliest fellow except yourself
in the whole round my acquaintance
 and you are one the best i ever met with to gain a point by
a good turn but take it and make the most you can it i may have an
opportunity paying you off in your own coin
tallyhoho laughed heartily at the manner in which sparkle had altogether
changed the conversation but could not help remarking that sir
frederick had not given a specimen his politeness by avoiding a
return sparkle's salutation
and yet continued sparkle he is one the most polished men i
know notwithstanding i think his upper story is not a bit too well
furnished he has a handsome fortune and a pretty wife who would
indeed be a lovely woman but for an affectation manners which she
assumed upon coming to the title lady forfeit their parties are 
the most dashing order and all the rank and fashion the metropolis
visit their mansion
sparkle who was in his usual humour for conversation and description
now entertained his friends with the following account a party with
whom he had spent an evening just previous to his departure from town
mrs stepswift is the widow lady a dancingmaster who having
acquired some little property previous to his decease left his partner
in possession his wealth and two daughters though the provision for
their education and support was but scanty the mother had the good luck
a few years after to add to her stock ten thousand pounds by a prize in
the lottery a circumstance which afforded her additional opportunities
 indulging her passion for dress which she did not fail to inculcate
in her daughters who though not handsome were rather pleasing and
agreeable girls and since the good fortune to which i have alluded she
has usually given a ball by way introduction to company and with the
probable view as they are now marriageable to secure them husbands
it was on one these occasions that i was invited and as i knew
but one the party i had an excellent opportunity making my
uninterrupted remarks
then said dashall i'll wager my life you acted the part an
observant quiz
and i should think you would be likely to win observed tallyhoho
 i am bound to consider myself obliged continued sparkle
for the bold construction you are kind enough to put upon my character
and conduct by your observations but never mind i am not to be
intimidated by the firing a popgun or a flash in the pan therefore
i shall proceed upon my introduction i found the widow playing a rubber
with a punchy parson a lean doctor and a halfpay officer in the
guards and consequently taking a friend i knew by the arm i strolled
through the rooms which were spacious and well furnished in the
ballroom i found numerous couples tripping it on the light fantastic
toe to the tune i'll gang no more to yon town and displaying
a very considerable portion grace and agility in the other room
devoted to refreshments and cards i met with several strollers like
myself who being without partners or not choosing to dance with such
as they could obtain were lounging away their time near the centre 
the room i was introduced to the two young ladies who behaved with the
utmost politeness and attention though i could easily perceive there
was a considerable portion affectation mingled with their manners
and i soon discovered that they operated as the loadstone attraction
to several dandylike beaux who were continually flocking around them
my dear miss eliza said a pugnosed dandy whom i afterwards
understood to be a jeweller's showman may i be allowed the superlative
honor and happiness attending you down the next dance the manner in
which this was spoken with a drawling lisp and the unmeaning attitude
 the speaker which was any thing but natural provoked my risibility
almost beyond forbearance his bushy head the fall his cape and the
awkward stickout his coat which was buttoned tight round his waist
the drop his quizzing glass from his bosom and the opera hat in his
hand formed altogether as curious a figure as i ever recollect to have
seen though my eyes were immediately directed to another almost as
grotesque by the young lady herself who informed the applicant that
she had engaged herself with captain scrambled and could not avail
herself his intended honor while the captain himself with a mincing
gait little compatible with the line life to which it was to be
presumed he was attached was advancing and eyeing the wouldbe rival
with all the apparent accuracy a mil
having satisfied themselves by looking over these extensive works mr
m informed them that adjoining the docks was a shipbuilding yard
formerly well known as perry's yard but now the property sir robert
wigwam probably you would like to take a view round it
to this having replied in the affirmative they were quickly introduced
sir robert said mr m has been and i believe still is a
considerable managing owner east india shipping whose fortune
appears to have advanced as his family increased and perhaps few men
have deserved better success he was born at wexford in ireland in the
year and was brought up under his father to the profession 
a surgeon he left ireland early in life to pursue his studies in
england and afterwards obtained an appointment as surgeon an east
indiamen and remained some years in the service he married miss
broadhurst the youngest daughter francis broadhurst mansfield
in nottinghamshire an eminent tanner and maltster soon after which
he commenced his career as owner east india shipping the general
goddard commanded by william taylor money esq sailed under his
management and was fortunate enough during the voyage to capture eight
dutch east indiamen considerable value off st helena since which
he has been one the most eminent shipowners in the city london
 a proof said sparkle the advantages to be derived from
perseverance and the active exercise an intelligent mind
his first wife continued the informant died in the year 
leaving him five children and in the following year he married miss
eleanor watts daughter john watts esq southampton many years
secretary to the victualling office who is the present lady wigwam
the benevolence whose heart and gentleness manners have not only
endeared her to her husband but gained her the esteem and regard all
who know her and by this lady he has had seventeen children
zounds said bob a man ought to have a mine wealth to support
such a numerous progeny
they are however all them well provided for and sir robert has
the happiness at an advanced age to find himself the father a
happy family he rejoices once a year to have them all seated at his
own table and has in many instances surprised his friends by an
introduction it is related that a gentleman from the isle wight
met him near the exchange and after mutual salutations were passed he
invited the gentleman to dine with him by whom an excuse was offered
as he was not equipped for appearing at his table nonsense said sir
robert you must dine with me and i can assure you there will be
only my own family present so come along guess the surprise his
visitor on being introduced to a large party ladies and gentlemen
he was confused and embarrassed he begged pardon and would have
retired declaring that sir robert had informed him that none but his
own family were to be present this sir r affirmed he had strictly
adhered to and introduced his friend to his sons and daughters by name
which it may fairly be presumed though it explained did not exactly
tend to decrease his visitor's embarrassment
and these premises inquired bob belong to the man you have
described
the same said mr m they are managed and conducted under the
superintendence two his sons here east india ships are built
launched and repaired there are two on the stocks now considerable
magnitude the premises are extensive and commodious and that high
building which you see is a masthouse and the other buildings about
the yard are devoted to sail lofts and shops for the various artizans
requisite to complete the grand design building and fitting
out a ship for sea from this yard you have a fine view over the marshes
towards woolwich and also a commanding prospect greenwich hospital
the various vessels and boats passing and repassing at all times give
variety to the scene before you and when a launch takes place the
whole neighbourhood represents something the nature a carnival
the river is covered with boats filled with company and every part 
the shore near the spot from which the magnificent piece mechanism is
to burst upon its native element is equally occupied temporary
booths are erected upon each side what is termed the cradle for the
accommodation invited visitors bands play as she moves and a bottle
 wine is thrown at her head as she glides from the stocks when her
name is pronounced amidst the universal shouts huzza
it must be a most gratifying sight observed bob to see her cleave
the watery world indeed it is a very pleasing view we have already
had these floating castles though i must also remark that your
descriptions have added greatly to the enjoyment and i think we are
much indebted for your kindness
they now parted with mr m and after refreshing with a glass wine
and a sandwich at the plough they proceeded to the west india docks
the entrance to which required no introduction here said dashall
you will find a much longer space occupied than at the east india
docks these were undertaken according to an act parliament passed
in and the place was formerly called the isle dogs though it
might almost as appropriately have been called the isle boys upon
the wharfs and quays adjoining all west india ships unload and load
their cargoes
and exclusively i suppose interrogated tallyhoho for the
accommodation west india shipping
exactly so continued tom the west india trade generally arrives in
fleets and formerly used to create much crowding confusion and damage
in the river but these ships being now disposed in the docks the
overgrown trade the port is carried on with pleasure and convenience
for notwithstanding they have occasioned a very important trade to
be removed to a considerable and even inconvenient distance from the
metropolis yet the advantages to the port london are upon the whole
incalculable
 the northern dock for unloading inwards is by 
feet and feet deep covering a space acres and capable
 containing from two to three hundred sail vessels in greater
security than the river could afford them and the west india dock
company are reimbursed for the accommodation by a tonnage s upon
the burthen every ship which enters the docks besides which they are
entitled to charge for wharfage landing housing weighing cooperage
and warehouse room certain rates upon all goods that are discharged
such as d per cwt upon sugar d per gallon upon rum is d per
cwt upon coffee s d per cwt upon cotton wool c and all this
immense business is conducted with a general order and regularity which
greatly facilitates the business the merchant
but said sparkle i apprehend it subjects him to something more 
expense than he incurred by the former mode proceeding
i am not able decidedly to answer continued tom but in the main i
expect that if so it is well worth what is paid to have the additional
security the forms conducting the business may sometimes be attended
with considerable trouble but there are persons so well acquainted with
them by habitual practice that there cannot be much difficulty at this
period this is the export dock which covers an area acres and
is by feet and deep the immense buildings round the two
docks are warehouses for the reception goods and are the most
substantial description and to enable shipping in their passage up and
down the thames to avoid the circuitous and inconvenient course round
the isle dogs a canal has been cut across this peninsula through
which upon paying certain moderate rates all ships vessels and
craft are permitted to pass in their passage up and down the river
in seeing this and tient date having been
made use even by the romans and not many years back a bush ivy
or a bunch grapes was used for the purpose nay to the present day
they may be met with in many places the bush is perhaps one the
most ancient publichouse signs which gave rise to the wellknown
proverb
good wine needs no bush
that is to say it requires nothing to point out where it is sold
at country fairs you will frequently see the houses in its vicinity
decorated with a bush or a bough from which they are termed bough
houses where accommodation may be found this practice i know is
still in use at boroughbridge in yorkshire during their annual fair in
june which lasts a week or ten days but putting up boughs as a sign 
any thing to be sold was not confined to alehouses for in old times
such as sold horses were wont to put flowers or boughs upon their heads
to reveal that they were vendible
 in all probability from this practice originated the well
known proverb
as fine as a horse
an illustration which from the life mrs
wilmington is here subjoined
they took places in the waggon for chester and quitted
london early on may morning and it being the custom on the
first this month to give the waggoner at every inn a
ribbon to adorn his team she soon discovered the origin 
the proverb as fine as a horse for before they got to
the the journey the poor beasts were almost blinded
by the tawdry partycoloured flowing honours their
heads
 in scotland a wisp straw upon a pole is or was some years
ago the indication an alehouse and to this day a ship or vessel for
sale may be discovered by a birch broom at the mast head i remember
reading that in fleet market on the eastern side there were some
small houses with a sign post representing two hands conjoined with
words marriages performed within written beneath them whilst a dirty
fellow assailed the ears the passengers with the reiterated and loud
address sir will you walk in and be married as if the dread 
any stoppage in the trade conjugality was threatening mankind with
premature extinction and the parson was seen walking before his shop
ready to couple you for a dram gin or a roll tobacco
those were the times for getting married exclaimed bob no
affidavits certificates and exposures at church doors
no continued sparkle those are signs altered times a witty
wigmaker adopted the sign absalom hanging to a tree with king david
lamenting at a distance who was represented with a label issuing from
his mouth containing these words
o absalom my son my son
had'st thou a peruke worn thou had'st not been undone
this sign if i remember right was to be seen a few years since in
unionstreet borough and is not uncommon even now in france where you
may also find the cochon sans tete the pig without a head which is
generally a restaurateur's sign indicating that good pork is here the
useless animal's head is off illustrative the negro's opinion 
a pig in england de pig said mungo is de only gentleman in
england man workee woman workee horse workee ass workee ox workee
and dog worked pig do nothing but eat and sleep pig therefore de only
gentleman in england
 the conversation increased in interest as they proceeded and
tallyhoho was all attention for it must be observed that as his inquiry
had occasioned it he was willing to listen to all that could be
advanced on the subject and the hon tom dashall determined to have his
share in the explanation
the man in the moon said he is derived from the old observation
that a tipsy person is in the wind or in the moon a lunatic the
sign may therefore be thought to give this advice here is good drink
gentlemen walk in and taste it it will make you as happy as the man in
the moon that is to say steep your senses in forgetfulness the
bag nails was the sign an inn at chelsea which may perhaps
be noticed as the ne plus ultra ludicrous corruption having
originally been a group bacchanals 
here risibility could no longer be restrained and a general laugh
ensued
a group bacchanals however continued tom is certainly not an
out the way sign for an inn nor do i conceive its corruption so
very outre when we look at others that have suffered much stranger
metamorphoses for who would have thought that time could have performed
such wonderful changes as to have transformed a view cologne harbour
into a black bull and a tremendous mouth sufficiently large to
swallow its neighbours horns and all or the name la belle sauvage or
beautiful savage into a bell and a gigantic wild man the woods
then again said sparkle taking up the subject the pole and bason
though no longer the exhibited emblems a barber's occupation in
london are still very often to be met with in its environs and in the
country where they are ostentatiously protruded from the front 
the house and denote that one those facetious and intelligent
individuals who will crop your head or mow your beard dwelleth here
like all other signs that the barber is remote antiquity and has
been the subject many learned conjectures some have conceived it
to originate from the word poll or head but the true intention 
the partycoloured staff was to indicate that the master the shop
practised surgery and could breathe a vein as well as shave a beard
such a staff being to this day used by practitioners and put into the
hand the patient while undergoing the operation phlebotomy the
white band which no doubt you have observed encompassing the staff was
meant to represent the fillet thus elegantly twined about it
 and this said sparkle appears to be the most reasonable
conjecture any i ever heard as it is well known the two businesses
were in former times incorporated together and the practiser was termed
a barber surgeon then as to their utility the choice a
witty device or splendid enluminure was formerly thought great
consequence to a young beginner in the world and i remember reading 
an innkeeper at cassel who having considerably profited by his numerous
customers under the sign the grey ass supposing himself well
established in his trade and his house began to be tired the vulgar
sign over his door and availed himself the arrival the landgrave
 hesse to make as he thought a very advantageous change in an
evil hour therefore the grey ass was taken down and thrown aside
in order to give place to a well painted and faithful likeness the
prince which was substituted for it as a most loyal sign
a small and almost unfrequented house in the same town immediately
took up the discarded sign and speculatively hoisted the grey ass
what was the consequence old codgers married men with scolding vives
at home straggling young fellows and all the fraternity free
topers resorted to the house filled the taproom crammed the
parlour and assailed the bar the grey ass had the run and was all
the vogue whilst the venerable prince hesse swung mournfully
and deserted at the other place and enticed no visitors foreign
or domestic for it should be observed that the grey ass had such
reputation all over germany that every foreign nobleman or gentleman
who came to cassel was sure to order his coach or chaise to be driven
to the inn that name and this order course was still continued
for how was it to be known by travellers coming from vienna hungary or
bohemia that a certain innkeeper at cassel had altered his sign to the
inn therefore which was denominated the grey ass they still went
what could the poor deserted innkeeper do in such a case to deface he
stage very indifferent actors in society and large characters in the
playbills as well as loud thunders from the gods may be earned by
very stupid very vulgar and very illbred companions the same maybe
said poets we are poor creatures at best and the giant 
a reviewer very often cuts but a very sorry figure when left to the
rickety stilts his own unsupported judgment in a drawingroom you
are tolerably familiar with our political parties but you are yet to
be acquainted with our literary squads which are the most bigotted
selfish exclusive arrogant little knots little people it is
possible to conceive
by the time that colonel a had ended his short initiation into
these various arcana the company broke up the doctor to give a lecture
on eggshells at the committee taste lord flute to visit the opera
lord skimcream to the green boom lord flash to fives court to see a
setto by candlelight the exquisite to bouge et noir or almack's
and lord wetherwool to vote on an agricultural question without
understanding a syllable its merits
nevertheless i soliloquized as i rode home his lordship will
be surprised and gratified i dare say to find himself a perfect
demosthenes in the newspaper reports tomorrow morning hems coughs
stammering blowing the nose and tenminute lapses memory
all vanish in passing through the sieves and bolters a report what
magicians the reporters are what talents what powers language they
profusely and gratuitously bestow somnus protect me from hearing any
but some half dozen orators in both houses the reader who peruses the
report has only the flour the orator's efforts provided for him
but lord help the unfortunate patient in the gallery who hopeless
 getting through the dense mass which occupy the seats round him is
condemned to sit with an aching head and be well nigh choaked with
the husks and the bran
 our party felt so much amused by these lively and
characteristic pictures real life among the corinthians the
metropolis that all thoughts seeking amusement out doors appeared
for the present relinquished and sparkle to keep the subject alive
resumed as follows
in order to give some shade and variety to this sketch society
in the west we will now if agreeable travel eastward as far as the
entrance to the city where i will introduce you in fancy to what must
at least to our friend tallyhoho afford both novelty and surprise
some time ago and before i was quite so well versed in the knowledge
 life in london as at present through the medium one the young
men genius about town i became a member a new philosophical
society called the socraticss held at a certain house near temple bar
having been plucked by several kind friends till i resembled the man
 diogenes i concluded that here at least my pockets might be
tolerably safe from the diving a friendly hand philosophers i was
told by my friend the introducer had souls above money their thoughts
were too sublime and contemplative for such worldlyminded concerns
i should have a great deal instruction for little or nothing i had
only to pay my two guineas per annum and the business was done the
gate science was open and nothing farther was requisite than to push
forward and imitate socrates but how strangely do our anticipations
mislead our sober judgments
jove breaks the tallest stilts human trust
and levels those who use them with the dust
the proprietor the institution was rather courtierlike in
making promises which the managers course considered as much too
commonplace and mechanical to be kept it professed to exclude politics
and religion from the touch its scientific paws in other words from
its discussions but alas
it kept the word promise to the ear
and broke it to the hope
 the only subjects which it did not exclude were politics
and religion neither could it be said that either these subjects
received more benefit from the way in which they were handled thana
white dress would from the handling a chimneysweeper the first
being made as black as possible in the form tompaynim and the
latter served up in the improved shape harley's or atheism under
such instruction it was scarcely possible but that i should in process
 time become qualified not only for a philosopher but a legislator
 the first water and i had serious thoughts offering my services
for the purpose drawing up a code laws to the otaheitans or the
kalmuck if i had gone on improving as i did i might perhaps have
carried out to some blackwood settlement or atlantic island as pretty a
utopian prescription under the designation a constitution as could
well be desired in the most philosophical community but one those
sad trifles which suffocate great ideas and sometimes terminate in
suffocating philosophers put a stop to my further enlightenment for the
present by drying up the treasury the socraticss the philosophers
were the most civil as well as the most unfortunate people in the world
one or other them was always in want money either to perfect
some great scheme or to save him from the unscientific handling a
bailiff it was enough to move a milestone to think how the progress
 improvement or march mind as it is called might be delayed by
being too coldhearted and it did move my purse to such a degree that
at length i had the satisfaction discerning truth sitting sola at
the bottom it my pocket consumption however was not instant but
progressive it might be called a slow fever some the philosophers
visited me for a loan like a monthly epidemic others drained me like
a tertian and one or two came upon me like an intermittent ague
every other day among these was mr maxwell the editor as he called
himself a magazine this fellow had tried a number schemes in
the literary line though none had hitherto answered but he had the
advantage and credit shewing in his own person the high repute in
which literature is held in london for he could seldom walk the streets
without having two followers at his heels one whom frequently tapped
him on the shoulder no doubt to remind him mortality like the
slave in the roman triumphs the favourite thesis this
gentleman was the march mind and on this subject he would spout
his half hour in so effectual a manner as to produce two very opposite
effects viz the closing the eyes the elder philosophers and
the opening mine which latter operation was usually rendered more
effectual by his concluding inquiry have you such a thing as a pound
note about you
to match this saint there was another
as busy and perverse a brother
this was the treasurer the socraticss thomas carney little esq
and a treasure a treasurer he was this gentleman was a pupil 
aesculapius and united in his own person the various departments 
dentist apothecary and surgeon it is presumed that he found the
employment drawing the eye teeth philosophical tyros more
profitable and bleeding the young socraticss more advantageous than
physicking his patients in his lectures he advocated the system 
research and admired deduction and this i among many others had
reason at last to know it was very odd but so it was that some two
or three hundred per annum subscribed by the members the society
vanished into the worthy treasurer's pocket as it were a moskoestron
and then disappeared for ever
another the socraticss was called epictetus moonshine esquire this
gentleman was a tall spiderlike man with lantern jaws hatchet face
and a mouth the chief characteristic which was that it made a
diagonal line from the bottom the face to the eyebrow he was a
great speculator and had taken it into his head that beyond the
blue mountains in new south wales was the real el dorado but as he
possessed according to the usual phrase more wit than money and no
one will discount a check from the aforesaid wit on change the zeal
 epictetus moonshine some time after the breaking up the socratic
institution for benefitting the human race so much got the better 
selflove that he committed several petty larcenies in hopes being
transported thither but whether his courage or his luck failed him
certain it is that he never reached the proper degree criminality
and only succeeded in visiting by turns the various penitentiaries in
london and its vicinity
 you mistake greatly sir said he to one the visiting
governors bridewell who condoled with a man his talents in such a
position if you think a residence in this sequestered haunt a subject
 regret the mind as milton says is its own seat and able itself
to make
a heaven hell a hell heaven
and now i am on the subject stoicism permit me to shew you a picture
which i have just chalked out wherein i prove that there is no such
thing as pain in the world that all which we now feel is imagination
that the idea body is deception i have had it printed written in
fourteen languages and presented to all the sovereigns europe with
a new code laws annexed to it i'll bring it in a minute if you'll
excuse me so saying the pupil zero disappeared wrapping his
blanket round him but other speculations matters high no doubt
attracted him from the remembrance his promise just as he forgot to
pay some score pounds he borrowed me for the visitor saw no more 
him
the mention el dorado brings to my recollection another member mr
goosequill who came to town with halfacrown in his pocket and his
tragedy called the mines peru by which he course expected to
make his fortune for five years he danced attendance on the manager
in order to hear tidings its being cast and four more in trying to
get it back again during the process he was groaned laughed whistled
and nearly kicked out the secretary's room who swore which he well
might do considering the exhausted treasury the concern that he
knew nothing about nor ever heard the mines peru at last mr
goosequill being shewn into the manager's kitchen to wait till he was
at leisure had the singular pleasure seeing two acts the mines
 peru daintily fastened round a savory capon on the spit to
preserve it from the scorching influence the fire
this was foul treatment i observed as he concluded his tale and i
ventured to ask how he had subsisted in the meanwhile why said he
i first made an agreement with a printer ballads in seven dials
who finding my inclinations led to poetry expressed his satisfaction
telling me that one his poets had lost his senses and was confined
in bedlam and another was become dozed with drinking drams
an agreement was made continued he and i think i earned fivepence
halfpenny per week as my share this speculation with the muses
but as my profits were not always certain i had often the pleasure 
supping with duke humphrey and for this reason i turned my thoughts to
prose and in this walk i was eminently successful for during a week 
gloomy weather i published an apparition on the substance which i
subsisted very comfortably for a month i have often made a good meal
upon a monster a rape has frequently afforded me great satisfaction
but a murder welltimed was a neverfailing resource
but to return to the catastrophe the socraticss by the time that
the philosophical experiments in diving without hydraulics had cleaned
me entirely out it was suggested that any thing in the shape a loan
would be desirable they were not nice not they a pair globes a
set catoptric instruments an electrical apparatus a few antique
busts or a collection books for the library any old rum as
jacksaid would do and all and every the beforementioned loans
would be most punctually taken care and truly enough they were for
the lender was never destined to cast an eye on any portion the loan
again i was indeed so fortunate as to catch a glimpse my globes
and instruments at a pawnbroker's and the fragments my library at
sundry bookstalls it was now high time to cut the connection for the
socraticss were rapidly withdrawing the association for want the
true golden astringent like a dumpling without its suet or a cheap
baker's quartern loaf without its doctor ie alum was falling to
pieces the worthy treasurer had retired seizing on such articles as
were most within reach and when i called upon him with my resignation
i had the pleasure seeing my own busts handsomely lining the walls 
the tooth drawer's passage i waited on the socraticss for the bums they
had been so polite as to borrow one to shew that he had profited by
studying socrates threatened to accuse me and the society a plot to
overturn the government if a syllable more on so low a subject as money
was mentioned another told me that he was just going on a visit to
abbot's park for three months and should be glad to see me when he came
back a third an unwashed artificer was so kind as to inform me that
 he had just got whitewashed and he did not care one straw
for my black looks and a fourth an indexmaker when presented
with his acceptance kindly indicated that he had not the slightest
recollection the thing and that if i persisted in compelling
payment he would bring a philosophical gentleman from cold bath
fields and two honest men from newgate to swear that it was not his
handwriting
the dropcurtain being thus let down on the last act the farce
there was no alternative between being queerly plundered or instantly
laying a horsewhip over the hungry philosophers to sue them reminded
me the proverb sue a beggar c to crack a masculine joke over
their sconces would involve an expense which the worthy philosophers
were not worth i had done an imprudent thing in joining the march 
mind and all that i could do was to brush the dust from my coat and
the mud from my shoes he that touches pitch says solomon shall
he not be denied thereby mr treasurer therefore remained in
quiet possession the busts the bookstall displayed the properly
appreciated volumes and the socratic borrowers took all the care in the
world value received
thus the day which it was intended to have been spent in amusements
out doors was passed in animated and amusing conversation over the
hospitable and convivial board and a fresh zest was added to wit and
humour by the exhilarating influence the rosy god
chapter xxxii
in london blest with competence
with temper health and common sense
none need repine or murmur nay
all may be happy in their way
e'en the lone dwelling the poor
and suffering are at least obscure
and in obscurity exempt
from poverty's worst scourge contempt
unmark'd the poor man seeks his den
unheeded issues forth again
wherefore appears he none inquires
nor why nor whither he retires
all that his pride would fain conceal
all that shame blushes to reveal
the petty shifts the grovelling cares
to which the sous want are heirs
those evils grievous to be borne
call forth not sympathy but scorn
here hidden elude the searching eye
 callous curiosity

the following morning was one unusual bustle activity and anxiety
the originally intended movements the party being thus unexpectedly
interrupted dashall had arisen before his usual hour and departed from
home before the appearance sparkle and bob to breakfast it was 
course supposed that the promised duel would have decided the fate 
one the antagonists before they should see him again
in this conjecture however they were pleasingly disappointed by his
arrival about half past eleven o'clock
well said sparkle it is all over who has fallen which is the
man how many shots what distance who was the other second and where
is the wounded hero
nay said tom you are beforehand with me i have none the
intelligence you require i have been in search lord bluster
who left town this very morning three hours before my arrival for
edinburgh and consequently i suppose either has no intimation 
laconic's intention to seek or if he has is determined to be out 
the way receiving a regular challenge so that in all probability
it will like many other duels in smoke
 notwithstanding your friend's letter was so full fire
observed tallyhoho
but perhaps he became more cool over a bottle claret toe to toe my
boy continued sparkle
this conversation was interrupted by a letter which being delivered
to tom he read aloud interrupted only by laughter which he could not
restrain
dear tom don't like fighting in england am off directly for
cork tell bluster i'll wait there till he comes but if he values
his life not to come at allplease do the needful in despatching my
servants c within two days for i am in such a passion i can't wait a
moment so adieu
yours sincerely laconic
excellent upon my word said sparkle here are two men honour
determined upon meeting running away from each other even before the
preliminaries are arranged
there is novelty in it at least said tom though i am by no means
astonished at the it for i before observed i do not think
either them over fond powder laconic pretended that nothing would
satisfy him but fighting immediately provided bluster was to be found
any person to whom his character was not known would have expected
some spilling blood before this time but it is now plain that this
blustering was the effect the wine and the man's cooler judgment has
extinguished the flame his irritability
i think said tallyhoho it would be well to advise them to meet
halfseas over and draw a cork together by way settling their
differences
curse their differences replied dashall i'll have nothing more to
do with them upon the whole i am glad now that i could not meet with
bluster or i should have looked like a fool between the two and as it
is i am not much pleased with the adventure particularly as it must
necessarily delay me and i hate the idea travelling alone i should
very much have liked to start with you but as laconic has made me fully
acquainted with his affairs in case he should fall in the intended
duel i must even comply with the contents his note though if he
had not actually departed you may rest assured i would have nothing to
do with him or his concerns
 come come cried sparkle grumbling is no use now and
as the circumstances are not made public the duellists will escape
being laughed at there is no harm done we must be upon the alert we
shortly bid adieu to london and shall not be so well pleased to
leave you behind but remember you promise to follow as quickly as
possible now how shall we dispose the remainder the time
zounds replied tom all my plans are deranged by this foolish affair
 laconic's and i can hardly tell which way to move however i shall
not devote myself to his affairs today therefore i am at your service
and as time is but short with us let us make good use it the
tragedy the duel having ended most comically i am prepared for anything
farcical therefore say the word and i am your man for a toddle
east west north or south
upon this intimation our friends sallied forth upon a sort quixotic
excursion in search adventures for neither could make up his mind
as to the precise place their destination when the first object that
attracted their particular notice was a large printed bill announcing
to the public that the sale at fonthill abbey advertised for the th
 october would not take place in consequence the property being
disposed by private contractility
 the following appeared in the daily prints relating to
this valuable property
fonthill abbey the sale at this splendid mansion is not
to take place the estate having been sold by private
contract the purchaser is said to be mr farquhar a rich
east india merchant who is reported to have given l
for the property it is stated that every article in the
abbey goes with it with the exception the family plate
and pictures and a very few favourite rarities possession
is to be taken immediately the sale the whole estate is
an event for which the people the place seem to have been
totally unprepared they were led to believe from the
beginning that nothing was to be sold but the mere luxuries
 the place but as to the abbey they universally
asserted in the strongest manner as if they had good
reason to be convinced the thing that mr beckford
would as soon part with his life as with a residence which
he prized so dearly now however that they have heard from
the steward that the estate has been sold and that he has
received notice to quit his office in a fortnight they
begin to feel that they have lost an excellent landlord mr
beckford has taken a house in town in the new road where
he means chiefly to reside in future every body is aware
that the chief part that princely income which enabled
him to raise this expensive edifice from the foundation was
derived from his paternal estates in the west indies such
was the wealth which those estates at one time produce
that it obtained for his grandfather the distinction 
being considered the richest subject in europe for the last
ten years they have declined very materially and several 
them have been entirely lost through a defect that has been
discovered in the title the original purchaser obtained
these in the way mortgage and having foreclosed them in
an technical manner advantage has been taken the
informality by the heirs the mortgagors and mr beckford
has been dispossessed the defence his title and the
other consequences involved him in losses and vast
expenses besides which the revenue from his unquestionable
estates in those islands has declined to less than onetenth
 what it formerly was mr farquhar the gentleman who is
reported to have purchased fouthill abbey is the principal
partner and proprietor whitehead's brewhouse and is
likewise at the head the first mercantile house in the
city for the management all agency concerns connected
with india
 thousands people says dashall who had been flocking to
that neighbourhood intending to obtain a view the premises will by
this event be disappointed several my friends have paid a visit toit
and describe it as a most princely mansion
and pray inquired sparkle what is the cause its being sold at
all it has always been reported that mr beckford was a man very
extensive property
that appears to be a little mysterious and report who is always a
busy fellow on extraordinary occasions has not been idle by some it is
stated that mr beckford suffered great and irreparable losses in his
west india property and that there are in the abbey at this moment
executions to the amount eighty thousand pounds that the view the
effects has taken place entirely under the control the sheriffs by
others it is asserted that no such embarrassment exists however be
that as it may the public have been highly gratified for some time past
in being permitted to view the estate and the valuable curiosities it
contains and the produce the admission tickets which has probably
netted twenty thousand pounds goes to the liquidation the debts
 and an excellent plan for raising the wind too said tallyhoho
the example i suppose has been taken from wanted house
most likely was the reply but if it is true that the disposal 
the property is occasioned by the embarrassment its owner it cannot
but excite painful and melancholy reflections on the tenure by which
men hold the goods this life those who were acquainted with mr
beckford's circumstances some years ago thought him so secured in the
enjoyment a princely income that he was absolutely out the reach
 ill fortune being at one time in the actual receipt one hundred
thousand pounds a year it cannot be said him that he has wasted his
inheritance at the gamingtable the palace which he raised on a barren
mountain the greater part those vast plantations which surround it
the collection books and rare specimens art and the superb
furniture which gives such peculiar dignity and splendour to the
interior his residence speak at once the immensity his means and
attest the propriety and gracefulness their application
we ought to have taken a trip there to have seen this earthly
paradise rejoined tallyhoho but now i suppose it is all over
certainly was the reply and it is a circumstance for which the
people in the neighbourhood appear to have been totally unprepared they
were led to believe from the beginning that the mere luxuries 
the place were to be sold and the public announcement this had the
effect filling the county wilts with pleasurehunters from all
quarters he was fortunate who for some time past could find a
vacant chair within twenty miles fonthill the solitude a private
apartment was a luxury which few could hope for and an old friend
 mine informs me in one his letters that coming from london
travellers first met their troubles about salisbury the languages 
france holland and germany the peculiarities in tongue 
scotland and ireland the broad dialect somersetshire the tinkling
accent wales and the more polished tones metropolitan residents
were all at the same moment to be heard clashing and contending there
were bells ringing and chambermaids screaming horses prancing and
postboys swearing wheels clattering and waiters jostling guests
threatening and hubbub and confusion the orders the day and all
this to see something which half them when they got there if they
were so fortunate could not obtain a sight so that perhaps we
have been quite as well off in remaining at home
 that was spoken like a philosopher said sparkle
dryly but pray who is to be the future possessor this fine
estate
a mr farquhar who according to the best information i have obtained
is a man an extraordinary character and has given l for it
as it stands with every article in the abbey except the family plate
and pictures and a few very favourite rarities some interesting
particulars the purchaser have recently been made known from which
it appears that he is a native aberdeen and went out early in life
to india where he was employed in the medical department chemical
research was his favourite pursuit there was some defect in the manner
 manufacturing gunpowder and mr farquhar was selected to give his
assistance by degrees he obtained the management the concern and
finally he became the sole contractor to the government in this way
wealth and distinction rapidly poured in upon him after some years 
labour he returned to england with half a million money and it is
somewhat curious that a man possessed so much money upon his arrival
at gravesend should merely to save the expense coachhire walk upto
london which however it appears he did when his first visit
very naturally was to his banker without waiting for refreshment or
alteration attire full dust and dirt with clothes not worth a
guinea he presented himself at the counter and asked for mr courts
the clerks not much prepossessed in his favour by his appearance
disregarded his application and he was suffered to remain in the
cashoffice under the idea his being some poor petitioner until mr
courts passing through it recognized his indian customer the man whom
he expected to see with all the pomp a nabob mr farquhar requested
to have five pounds which having received he took his departure this
anecdote strongly marks the character and habits the man he soon
afterwards settled in upper bakerstreet where his house was to be
distinguished by its dingy appearance uncleaned windows and general
neglect an old woman was his sole attendant and his apartment to
which a brush or broom was never applied was kept sacred from her care
his neighbours were not acquainted with his character and there have
been instances some them offering him money as an object 
charity
 an admirable tenant for such a place as fonthill truly
observed sparkle why what the devil will he do with it now he has
got it
perhaps said dashall i ought to refer you to the man himself for
an answer to such a question for i am at a loss to guess he is now
sixtyfive years age and still in single blessedness
a very enviable situation remarked sparkle however continued tom
he has done some good in the world and may live to do more he became
a partner in the great agency house in the city basset farquhar
and co besides which he purchased the late mr whitehead's share in
the brewery part his great wealth was devoted to the purchase 
estates but the great bulk was invested in stock and suffered to
increase on compound interest he is deeply read in ancient and modern
literature and has a mind extraordinary vigour and originality
his conversation a superior order impressive and animated on every
subject his sentiments are liberal and strangely contrasted with his
habits his religious opinions are peculiar and seem to be influenced
by an admiration the purity the lives and moral principles the
brahmins it is said that he offered l to found a college in
aberdeen with a reservation on points religion to which however
the sanction the legislature could not be procured and the plan
was dropped he has been residing in gloucesterplace where he
has furnished a house in a style modern elegance and so far
as appearances are concerned indulges in several luxuries but his
domestic habits are still the same and his table seldom labours with
the pressure heavy dishes he has one nephew to whom he allows or
did allow l per year has but few other claims family and it
is probable that his immense wealth will be bequeathed to charitable
purposes as the great object his ambition is to leave his name to
posterity as the founder some public institution to that passion
may perhaps be attributed the purchase fonthill abbey for his age
and infirmities totally unfit him for the enjoyment such 
a place he is diminutive in person and by no means prepossessing in
appearance his dress has all the qualities the antique to recommend
it and his domestic expenditure until the last year has not exceeded
l per annum although his possessions money in the funds and
capital in trade are said to amount to a million and a half
why he is an oddity indeed exclaimed tallyhoho and i think he ought
to be exhibited as the eighth wonder the world
certainly we cannot look upon the like every day there are instances
it is said his having returned letters merely because the postage
was not paid although he has on more than one or two occasions given
away at once for praiseworthy purposes ten and twenty thousand
pounds
then rejoined sparkle he is a trump and deserves to be
respected but where are we bound to
nay replied tom i have no choice upon the subject
nor i neither said gayfield stepping smartly up to him and catching
him by the hand so come along i'll guide you to good quarters and
comfortable accommodation dine with me and we will have a cut in at
whist what say you
this proposition was acceded to and away they went to gayfield's
apartments where a very hospitable and friendly entertainment was
presented to them with every mark a hearty welcome in the evening
the glass circulated freely and cards being introduced they enjoyed an
agreeable and pleasant game at which nothing particular occurred after
which they jumped into a rattler and were conveyed home very well
satisfied with every attention they had received from gayfield except
the eternal rattle his tongue
chapter xxxiii
the proper study mankind in food

next morning while our party were at breakfast who should make his
appearance but gayfield whose elasticity spirits and volubility 
tongue appeared if possible to have acquired an additional impulse 
action
my dear fellow he commenced addressing bob as you are so soon
about to leave us i feel anxious you should carry with you all the
information possible on that interesting subject life in london long
as your stay in the metropolis has been still where the subjects
are so varying so ever varying so multifarious and the field for
observation so unlimited it is impossible but that something must have
escaped your notice
i have been scribbling to a friend in the country whom i occasionally
endeavour to amuse with sketches scenes in london and as i
flatter myself it exhibits something novelty both in character
situation and incident you shall hear it
dear dick i told you that i was about to have the honour being
introduced to tin celebrated dr kitchen he was a man take him for
all in all i ne'er shall look upon his like again it was evidently
one nature's worst journeymen that made him for he has not a limb
which appears to appertain to his body they look precisely as if they
were purchased at an auction this little man who seems born to be
girded at by jokers all classes sharing the prevalent rage for
notoriety has written two works one in the character a gourmand 
and the other a musician but not content with the fame he has thus
acquired he has persuaded himself that he is an excellent singer nay
it was given out lately by his own concurrence that he intended to
sing at a concert at the argyle rooms and although he has no more voice
than a cat he was under the full impression that his majesty
at the conclusion the last courtday intended to call upon him fora
song the doctor asked me and caustic to one his literary dinners
and as t have supplied you with a sketch a cookshop gourmand i
make no apology for shewing up a more elevated class gastronomes 
by reporting the doctor's speech on this occasion
eon entering the world the acuteness my palate and vigour 
digestion disposed me to conceive that i should excel in the fraternal
sciences eating and drinking and i entertained no doubt but my vapid
organs would be considerably improved by frequent exercise taste
has various departments painting architecture sculpture c but
impressed with the conviction that my only office in this world was to
invent new dishes and devour them i collected all the culinary writers
from caxton to mons ude modern celebrity as science proceeds by
gradual advances i frequented the better sort coffeehouses to
initiate myself in the correct nomenclature different dishes and
to judge their skilful preparation these to be sure are proper
schools for a beginner but i soon discovered that these victuallers
on account their numerous visitants who are disposed to eat much and
pay little could not afford to furnish the most costly and exquisite
entrees sometimes i found that the same turkey had been twice
subjected to the spit a sole that had been broiled the day before
underwent the operation frying on the following cold meat appeared
as hot pie with many other curious and ingenious devices then the wine
was so adulterated compelled like a melancholic patient to look
old before its time and fitted like a pauper with a readymade coat
perceptibly impregnated with bad brandy and tasted every thing
but the grape that in about six months i sickened and no longer
frequented these tasteless and inhospitable retreats for the hungry
to view the ordinary arrangements a modern dinner is a sorry
sight a dozen articles placed at once upon the table then on
the removal the covers comes the ferocious onset some tremulous
paralytic serving the soup and scattering it in all directions
excepting into the plate where it ought to be delivered then
an unhandy dandy mutilates the fish by cutting it in a wrong direction
here an officious ignoramus tears asunder the members a fowl as
coarsely as the four horses dragged ravillac limb from limb there
another simpleton notching a tongue into dissimilar slices while a
purblind coxcomb confounds the different sauces pouring anchovy on
pigeonpie and parsley and butter on roastbeef all these barbarisms
are unknown at my table
perhaps one the most gratifying things in nature far beyond anything
hitherto conveyed by landscape or historical painting is to
behold my guests in silence sip their wine as the glass is held up the
eye and the orient liquor reciprocally sparkle its bouquet expands the
nostrils elevates the eyebrow to admiration and composes the lips to
a smile when its crystal receptacle which is as thin as indian paper
for observe to use a thick wineglass is to drink with a gag in your
mouth touches the lips they become compress to allow the thinnest
possible stream to enter that its flavour be thoroughly ascertained
and that successive perceptions palatable flavour may terminate in
the gulph ecstacy
i am fully aware that the pleasures the table cannot be indulged
without some hazard to the constitution it is therefore the business
 my serious reflections to counteract the invasions disease and
provide timely remedies for its attack a gold box is always placed on
the table with the desert containing a store pills which are 
a very moving quality and speedy operation called peristaltic
persuaders in an adjoining room there is a basin as large as an
ordinary washingtub with a copper chamomiletea and a upper is
engaged to be in constant attendance till the guests depart
gentlemen i once became a member a fashionable dinnerclub
managed by a superintending committee who purchased their own wine
and engaged a culinary artist established reputation this club was a
diversified assemblage consisting some sprigs the nobility and
a few old standards several members parliament who became very
troublesome by repeating the speeches that had been uttered in the
house and were besides always attempting to reform the club but this
was less offensive to me than others as i make it a rule never
to attend to conversation unless it relates to improvements in cookery
the remainder our club was composed a few hungry querulous
lawyers two or three doctors who had increased the means gratifying
their appetites by destroying the digestive faculties their patients
there is nothing permanent in the world therefore in about two years
the club dwindled away a set rascally economists complained 
expense the cook a very honest man and skilful professor was
accused peculation by the reformers and turned adrift for modestly
demonstrating that he could not make turtle out tripe nor convert
sprats into red mullet several members moved off without paying
their arrears the managing committee disposed the premises plate
furniture and wines and pocketed the money and thus the club was
dissolved
it was on this occasion that the doctor proposed his celebrated
committee taste with the proceedings which i shall perhaps
have occasion at some future time to make you acquainted
gayfield's humorous epistle amused the party much and bob felt
complimented by the attention paid to the finish his studies 
metropolitan life and manners the fine appearance the morning
determined them on a stroll through the leading thoroughfares as it
would afford tallyhoho the opportunity completing such purchases as
were necessary prior to his departure for the country in passing
covent garden their attention was attracted by a numerous and grotesque
assemblage in which they soon mixed and were highly diverted by the
following whimsical exhibition displaying the astonishing sagacity and
feelings the monkey species an itinerant showman who for some time
past exhibited two dancing monkeys about the town had pitched his stage
in a part the market when his poles and cords were fixed and the
monkeys in their full dress were about to commence the celebrated
flying pitman came by with his basket and having furnished himself
with a bottle gin he leaped upon the stage and treated the showman
and one the monkeys with a glass each the other monkey however
declined taking any and was leaping about to avoid it but the pitman
served out the second glass and the former monkey took his with
apparent gladness the pitman again seized the monkey who
declined it before but he still scorned to take any the bysanders
called out to the pitman to throw it at him and the pitman flung it
in his face instantly the monkey who drank the gin and who was half
drunk by this time to resent the injury sprang upon the pitman seized
him by the arm and would have torn that piece the flesh entirely
out only for its master who with much difficulty made him relinquish
his hold the pitman was dangerously wounded and was carried to a
doctor's shop to get his arm dressed
passing on the next object attention was the police office bow
street here the party determined to rest for a short time and after
listening to several uninteresting cases relating to hackney coach
fares they were at length rewarded for their lost time and patience
by a case in which the tables were completely turned upon mr jehu and
which we hope will act as a caution to others the profession who have
a taste for swearing and abuse
chapter xxxiv
in cities foul example on most minds

in gross and pamper'd cities sloth and lust

the arrival the day for separation was anticipated and the morning
arose upon dashall with a gloomy aspect originating in the temper 
his mind for he was by no means pleased with the adventure laconic
which operated to prevent his departure with his friends sparkle and
tallyhoho were however upon the alert and determined on pursuing their
original intentions tom had none his usual vivacity about him
in vain he tried to muster up his spirits his attempts at wit were
pointless and did not escape the notice sparkle who secretly enjoyed
his chagrin feeling assured that as it was created by their departure
he would not delay joining them longer than necessity absolutely
required why how now tom said sparkle you are out and seem to be
in queer stirrups as if you had an uneasy saddle you seem to part
with your cousin as a young man would with the beloved his heart i
confess i am disappointed replied tom
but since grieving's a folly
why let us be jolly
 i am determined to spend the last moments with you so start
off the rattle traps the upper toggery's and travelling caps we will
take a last turn together and a parting dinner and glass wine at
the bull and mouth and i'll warrant you i won't be long behind all i
regret is i can't accompany you at present upon this intimation the
remainder their luggage and clothing were despatched by a servant
with an order to provide a good dinner for them at half past five
things were now all m a fair train and this business being despatched
all was anxiety for the arrival the moment though with different
sensations sparkle to meet his wife bob to return to his native home
and tom displeased and disappointed in every way although he determined
to be as agreeable as he could under existing circumstances time
however being heavy on their hands but as bob was anxious to make a few
more purchases for presents on his return home they started early for
the bull and mouth
you have now said dashall to his cousin had some experience in real
life in london and i have reason to think you will not return to the
country a worse man than you left it variety is charming and the
change from one to the other will give additional zest and pleasure
i have reason replied bob to feel myself under a very particular
obligation to you for the excellent care kindness and attention as
well as information i have derived and it cannot easily be obliterated
from my recollection but i at the same time must observe that i have
no very great relish for london as a continual residence when you
arrive in the country i will try if i cannot be as explanatory and
amusing at all events i expect you will give me the trial
i'll give you a chevy over the hills a pop at the pheasants and a
pick at them afterwards besides which you know we have some very
pretty lasses in our neighbourhood to whom you have already been
introduced and to whom you shall be better known
i know i know said tom in a hurried manner which strongly
indicated some other motive for regret than that which arose from mere
disappointment at not being a partner in their journey and from which
sparkle did not fail to draw an inference that some roguish eyes had
been darting their beams into the bosom his friend
 i see how it is now cried sparkle tom is not cut but
caught and i'll sport a fifty that the evergreen tom dashall 
london will be transplanted to entwine with some virgin blossom the
country before another twelve months
tom was silent
tallyhoho smiled in accordance with the sentiment sparkle and declared
he would not take the bet
it's very little use cried dashall recovering himself after a
short pause i may as well make a merit necessity i confess i
have a sort a liking for the gay and sprightly lydia forcetext the
parson's daughter and if but curse if's i hate if i wish there was
no such word in the english language
ha ha ha exclaimed sparkle i thought we should find you out but
come i think i may say there is not much for you to fear if you are
but serious
it is a serious subject and if we continue this conversation i shall
grow downright sentimental so no more at present we have not much time
to spare and as i mean to make use every minute let us look around
for any novelty that may occur before your departure
well said sparkle i must say i do not know any thing so new tome
as the very subject we were upon but as you wish it dropped why
e'en let it be so i have no desire to be either particular or
personal
and as london's the object we've long had in view
as long as we can we'll that object pursue
and as visions we know have been for an old grudge meant
we'll make ours a view not a vision judgment
good said tom and as the lines are extemporaneous we will not be
overnice in the criticism
at least continued sparkle you will admit it is better to be a bad
poet than a bad man
agreed agreed replied tom but who in the name wonder have
we here the emperor hairdressers and headcutters turned
printseller why this was money's where i have before now had a
clip
 nay nay said sparkle don't be in a hurry to form your
judgment his ingenuity is at work and really it will be worth while
to have a cut all round for i find he gives a portrait displaying
the most fashionable parisian dresses to every customer some you
know present bank or more properly speaking flush notes upon these
occasions but certainly this is a less exceptionable plan what say
you
with all my heart and into the magazine de mode they marched to
which they were welcomed by the artist himself ushered up stairs
with all due politeness and in two minutes sparkle was under his
incomparable hands while tom and bob amused themselves with a peep at
the newspapers and the gazette fashion
fine morning gentlemen said the friseur
is there any news asked sparkle
we have the paris papers sir regularly and a constant supply 
drawings the newest fashion
i am more for domestic or home news continued sparkle
not aware sir any thing particular oh yes i recollect i was
told last night over at the haunch that the mermaid is discovered
what said tom discover a mermaid over a haunch laying down the
paper
beg pardon sir beg pardon a trifling mistake sir nothing more i
usually pass a recreative hour after my daily studies at the haunch
 venison over the way the landlord is an intelligent accommodating
and agreeable sort man and we have many gentlemen considerable
consequence both literary and scientific who meet there an evening
to pass a convivial hour to hear and impart the news and sir as i
was saying the mermaid is stated to be a fine hoax upon the credulity
 john bull being nothing more than the body or skin a smokedried
old woman ingeniously connected with the tail a fish i don't vouch
for the truth the report i only state what i hear and can only
assert with confidence what i am acquainted with in my own business
i suspected the mermaid from the first answered tom i thought there
was some deceit in it
there is a great deal deceit in the world sir replied the active
clipper a little circassian cream sir acknowledged to be the best
article ever produced for the preservation and restoration hair
certainly said sparkle
 in this way our friends obtained a portion amusement and
a corinthian clip from the intelligent and communicative mr money 
fleet street notoriety in return for which he touched their coin
now said dashall we will make the best our way and just call
by way taking a lunch among the lads newgate market there is
a house where i have been before in which we can have some very
fine homebrewed ale c and besides according to the landlord's
advertisements he has opened an academy and gives instruction in
the art brewing the college physicians is just opposite and i
suppose this wag a landlord has taken the hint and opposed his beer
to their physic perhaps you may wish to carry his valuable receipt into
the country with you
i have no inclination to turn brewer replied sparkle but i
must confess i like the idea a little genuine beer free from the
poisonous ingredients the public brewer
and so do i continued tallyhoho come along then said tom the
bell in warwick lane is the shop where you may be served to a shaving
in passing along warwick lane bob observed he thought his friend was
leading him through a not very agreeable neighbourhood
this place is filled with slaughterhouses and is to be sure a great
nuisance to the city yet such places are necessary therefore bear up
a few minutes and you will have comfortable houseroom and agreeable
refreshment entering the bell they were met by the landlord the
house a roundfaced goodnatured real johnbulllooking man
who knowing his customer dashall immediately ushered them into the
coffeeroom where being supplied with stout and muttonchops in high
perfection they enjoyed themselves with their regale this done they
had an opportunity looking about them
in one corner sat two or three tiptop salesmen the market
conversing on the price meat while they were devouring a succession
 rumpsteaks with most voracious and insatiable appetites in another
was a hungry author bargaining with a bookseller paternoster row
for the sale a manuscript by which he expected to realise a dinner
while near them was an undertaker and a masterbuilder vociferating at
each other for interference with their respective trades and
so far attracting the attention the bookseller from the work the
author that he wished from the bottom his heart that one would
build a coffin to bury the other while the salesmen laughed so loud at
the observations the controversialists as almost to make them wish
the subject dead without the hope resurrection
bob liked the stout ordered a replenish and asked the landlord to
partake
with all my heart gentlemen good health real malt and hops
gentlemen nothing else all brewed under my own eye good ordinary at
two excellent fare good treatment comfortable beds happy to see you
at all times at the bell brewery
having proceeded on their journey they shortly found themselves near
bull and mouth street
on their way to the bull and mouth sparkle made a proposal which was
cordially acquiesced in by dashall and his cousin and a mutual pledge
was given to carry it into effect this was no other than an agreement
to take a trip over to dublin in the course the ensuing winter in
order to acquire some knowledge life in ireland
i have lately said sparkle been almost convulsed with laughter
even to the danger a lockedjaw by the perusal a work under
this title the author nephew to a late irish chancellor is an old
acquaintance added to which and the genuine irresistible humour that
runs throughout the work i feel determined to visit and have ocular
demonstration some the places where these scenes humour are so
admirably described
on entering bull and mouth street bless me cried bob this is a
very confined street for such an inn
hoy cried a coachman rattling along the street in double quick time
by your leave bawled a porter with a heavy chest on his back
we shall certainly either be knocked down or run over exclaimed
tallyhoho
never fear said tom do but keep your ogles in action all's right
enough and we shall soon be safely housed out the bustle but before
we enter the house we will just cast our eyes about us on the right
after passing the gate is the coachoffices for receiving booking
 and delivering parcels and taking places for passengers by the
various vehicles which start from this place on the left is the hotel
and coffeehouse where every refreshment and accommodation may be
obtained the remaining part the building together with several
others adjoining which almost occupy the whole this side 
the street are devoted to stables waggon and coachhouses and
outoffices
illustration pagejpg bull and mouth inn
it is an extensive concern then said tallyhoho though it stands in
such an out the way obscure situation
why you are already aware that situation is not absolutely necessary
to success in all cases in london was the reply the extensive
circulation a name or a sign are sometimes sufficient to obtain
business and who has not heard the bull and mouth or the name 
willan from the former runs a considerable number long stages and
mail coaches daily and nightly the proprietor being a contractor with
government and upon one occasion it is said he was in treaty to supply
an immense quantity horses to convey troops to the coast on the
threatened invasion by buonaparte so that the epithet patriotic might
properly be applied to him he however is lately deceased and supposed
to have left a considerable fortune but come dinner is ready now for
the parting meal and then heaven speed ye to your destined homes
after partaking a hearty dinner and a bottle or two generous
wine come said dashall it is time we are alive and look out for
the yard is all in a bustle here are lots coaches preparing for a
start so let us get out look around and see what is going forward
upon this intimation they sallied forth to the yard where the
confusion created by the arrival one coach heavily laden and
the preparation two for departure afforded a scene for a quiet
contemplation which however it is not easy to describe
coachman said an antiquated lady just alighting i paid my fare
yes ma'am that's all fair said coach
mind how you hand my dear little boy out the coach poor little
fellow he is quite dizzy with riding
 i thinks as how you had better have brought a man with you
for you want taking care yourself grumbled coach as he handed the
young one out there he is ma'am stand upon your pins my man
come charley oh coach you have got my box in your boot
aye aye ma'am i know it i wish my boot was in your box here it is
ma'am
stand bye said a jack tar let's have a little sea room and no
squalls
coach what a rude fellow that is he says i squalls
never mind him ma'am he is as rough as the element he belongs
to thank ye ma'am that's the time o day pocketing a halfcrown
which she had just given him
here bill take this lady's luggage out the way
just going off sir do you go by me
yes replied sparkle how many have you inside
only four sir and you two make up the number all ready jem bear up
the leaders
at this moment a hackney coach stopped at the gate and out jumps a
gentleman who immediately entered into conversation with the coachman
can't do it sir said coach all full i might manage to give you
an outside passage to be sure
well well i will make that do perhaps you can afford an inside birth
part the journey
i'll see what i can do but can't promise now gentlemen
here coachman said the person desirous obtaining a passage
tipping coach some money
aye aye that's the way to look at the matter
by this time tom discovered it was no other than van butchell whom
he observed to bob there was little doubt had been summoned on some
desperate case and must go at all events
 it is fortunate for the rising generation that the late
martin van butcher not more celebrated for his
eccentricities than his utility has not departed from the
world without leaving an able successor to his practice
edwin martin van butcher is now almost as well known as his
late father such indeed is the estimation his abilities
that a large society journeymen tailors have entered into
a weekly subscription among themselves in order that their
afflicted brethren may have the benefit his practical
knowledge and abilities
now gentlemen you brush in and i will brush on shut the door dick
all right ya hip
adieu dear tom exclaimed bob
 zounds exclaimed tom the coachman will hardly allow him to
say good bye well the dearest friends must part so good bye heaven
protect you both
by this time the vehicle was out the yard
i don't like it continued tom soliloquizing with himself but
however as i have bid them adieu for the present the best thing i
can do is to arrange laconic's affairs and then bid adieu to life in

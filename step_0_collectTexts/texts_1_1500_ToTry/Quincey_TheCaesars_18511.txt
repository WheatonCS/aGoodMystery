the cæsars the condition of the roman emperors has never yet been fully appreciated nor has it been sufficiently perceived in what respects it was absolutely unique there was but one rome no other city as we are satisfied by the collation of many facts either of ancient or modern times has ever rivalled this astonishing metropolis in the grandeur of magnitude and not many if we except the cities of greece none at all in the grandeur of architectural display speaking even of london we ought in all reason to say the nation of london and not the city of london but of rome in her palmy days nothing less could be said in the naked severity of logic a million and a half of souls that population apart from any other distinctions is per se for london a justifying ground for such a classification à fortiori then will it belong to a city which counted from one horn to the other of its mighty suburbs not less than four millions of inhabitants footnote concerning this question once so fervidly debated yet so unprofitably for the final adjudication and in some respects we may add so erroneously on a future occasion at the very least as we resolutely maintain after reviewing all that has been written on that much vexed theme and very probably half as many more republican rome had her prerogative tribe the earth has its prerogative city and that city was rome as was the city such was its prince mysterious solitary unique each was to the other an adequate counterpart each reciprocally that perfect mirror which reflected as it were in alia materia those incommunicable attributes of grandeur that under the same shape and denomination never upon this earth were destined to be revived rome has not been repeated neither has cæsar ubi cæsar ibi roma was a maxim of roman jurisprudence and the same maxim may be translated into a wider meaning in which it becomes true also for our historical experience cæsar and rome have flourished and expired together the illimitable attributes of the roman prince boundless and comprehensive as the universal air like that also bright and apprehensible to the most vagrant eye yet in parts and those not far removed unfathomable as outer darkness for no chamber in a dungeon could shroud in more impenetrable concealment a deed of murder than the upper chambers of the air these attributes so impressive to the imagination and which all the subtlety of the roman footnote or even of modern wit witness the vain attempt of so many eminent sort and illustrious antecessors to explain in self-consistency the differing functions of the roman cæsar and in what sense he was legibus solutus the origin of this difficulty we shall soon understand wit could as little fathom as the fleets of cæsar could traverse the polar basin or unlock the gates of the pacific are best symbolized and find their most appropriate exponent in the illimitable city itself that rome whose centre the capitol was immovable as teneriffe or atlas but whose circumference was shadowy uncertain restless and advancing as the frontiers of her all-conquering empire it is false to say that with cæsar came the destruction of roman greatness peace hollow rhetoricians until cæsar came rome was a minor by him she attained her majority and fulfilled her destiny caius julius you say deflowered the virgin purity of her civil liberties doubtless then rome had risen immaculate from the arms of sylla and of marius but if it were caius julius who deflowered rome if under him she forfeited her dowery of civic purity if to him she first unloosed her maiden zone then be it affirmed boldly that she reserved her greatest favors for the noblest of her wooers and we may plead the justification of falconbridge for his mother's trangression with the lion-hearted king such a sin was self-ennobled did julius deflower rome then by that consummation he caused her to fulfill the functions of her nature he compelled her to exchange the imperfect and inchoate condition of a mere fæmina for the perfections of a mulier and metaphor apart we maintain that rome lost no liberties by the mighty julius that which in tendency and by the spirit of her institutions that which by her very corruptions and abuses co-operating with her laws rome promised and involved in the germ even that and nothing less or different did rome unfold and accomplish under this julian violence the rape if such it were of cæsar her final romulus completed for rome that which the rape under romulus her earliest cæsar had prosperously begun and thus by one godlike man was a nation-city matured and from the everlasting and nameless footnote nameless city the true name of rome it was a point of religion to conceal and in fact it was never revealed city was a man produced capable of taming her indomitable nature and of forcing her to immolate her wild virginity to the state best fitted for the destined mother of empires peace then rhetoricians false threnodists of false liberty hollow chanters over the ashes of a hollow republic without cæsar we affirm a thousand times that there would have been no perfect rome and but for rome there could have been no such man as cæsar both then were immortal each worthy of each and the cui viget nihil simile aut secundum of the poet was as true of one as of the other for if by comparison with rome other cities were but villages with even more propriety it may be asserted that after the roman cæsars all modern kings kesars or emperors are mere phantoms of royalty the cæsar of western rome he only of all earthly potentates past or to come could be said to reign as a monarch that is as a solitary king he was not the greatest of princes simply because there was no other but himself there were doubtless a few outlying rulers of unknown names and titles upon the margins of his empire there were tributary lieutenants and barbarous reguli the obscure vassals of his sceptre whose homage was offered on the lowest step of his throne and scarcely known to him but as objects of disdain but these feudatories could no more break the unity of his empire which embraced the whole oichomeni the total habitable world as then known to geography or recognised by the muse of history than at this day the british empire on the sea can be brought into question or made conditional because some chief of owyhee or tongataboo should proclaim a momentary independence of the british trident or should even offer a transient outrage to her sovereign flag such a tempestas in matulâ might raise a brief uproar in his little native archipelago but too feeble to reach the shores of europe by an echo or to ascend by so much as an infantine susurrus to the ears of the british neptune parthia it is true might pretend to the dignity of an empire but her sovereigns though sitting in the seat of the great king o basileus were no longer the rulers of a vast and polished nation they were regarded as barbarians potent only by their standing army not upon the larger basis of civic strength and even under this limitation they were supposed to owe more to the circumstances of their position their climate their remoteness and their inaccessibility except through arid and sultry deserts than to intrinsic resources such as could be permanently relied on in a serious trial of strength between the two powers the kings of parthia therefore were far enough from being regarded in the light of antagonist forces to the majesty of rome and these withdrawn from the comparison who else was there what prince what king what potentate of any denomination to break the universal calm that through centuries continued to lave as with the quiet undulations of summer lakes the sacred footsteps of the cæsarean throne the byzantine court which merely as the inheritor of some fragments from that august throne was drunk with excess of pride surrounded itself with elaborate expressions of a grandeur beyond what mortal eyes were supposed able to sustain these fastidious and sometimes fantastic ceremonies originally devised as the very extremities of anti-barbarism were often themselves but too nearly allied in spirit to the barbaresque in taste in reality some parts of the byzantine court ritual were arranged in the same spirit as that of china or the birman empire or fashioned by anticipation as one might think on the practice of that oriental cham who daily proclaims by sound of trumpet to the kings in the four corners of the earth that they having dutifully awaited the close of his dinner may now with his royal license go to their own from such vestiges of derivative grandeur propagated to

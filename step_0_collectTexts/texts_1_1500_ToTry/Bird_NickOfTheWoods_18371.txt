nick of the woods chapter i the sun of an august afternoon was yet blazing upon the rude palisades and equally rude cabins of one of the principal stations in lincoln county when a long train of emigrants issuing from the southern forest wound its way over the clearings and among the waving maize-fields that surrounded the settlement and approached the chief gate of its enclosure the party was numerous consisting perhaps of seven or eight score individuals in all men women and children the last bearing that proportion to the others in point of numbers usually found in a borderer's family and thus with the help of pack-horses cattle and a few negroes the property of the more wealthy emigrants scattered here and there throughout the assemblage giving to the whole train the appearance of an army or moving village of vandals in quest of some new home to be won with the edge of the sword of the whole number there were at least fifty well-armed some of these however being striplings of fourteen and in one or two instances even of twelve who balanced the big rifle on their shoulders or sustained it over their saddle-bows with all the gravity and dignity of grown warriors while some few of the negroes were provided with the same formidable weapons in fact the dangers of the journey through the wilderness required that every individual of a party should be well armed who was at all capable of bearing arms and this was a kind of capacity which necessity instilled into the american frontiersman in the earliest infancy of this armed force such as it was the two principal divisions all well mounted or at least provided with horses which they rode or not as the humour seized them were distributed in military order on the front and in the rear while scouts leading in the van and flanking parties beating the woods on either side where the nature of the country permitted indicated still further the presence of a martial spirit on the part of the leaders the women and children stowed carefully away for the most part with other valuable chattels on the backs of pack-horses were mingled with droves of cattle in the centre many of which were made to bear burdens as well as the horses of wheeled carriages there was not a single one in the whole train the difficulties of the road which was a mere bridle-path being such that they were never at that early day attempted to be brought into the country unless when wafted in boats down the ohio thus marshalled and stealing from the depth of the forest into the clearings around the station there was something in the appearance of the train wild singular and striking the tall and robust frames of the men wrapped in blanket coats and hunting-frocks some of which where the wearers were young and of gallant tempers were profusely decked with fringes of yellow green and scarlet the gleam of their weapons and the tramp of their horses gave a warlike air to the whole typical it might be supposed of the sanguinary struggle by which alone the desert was to be wrung from the wandering barbarian while the appearance of their families with their domestic beasts and the implements of husbandry was in harmony with what might be supposed the future destinies of the land when peaceful labour should succeed to the strife of conquest the exiles were already in the heart of their land of promise and many within view of the haven where they were to end their wanderings smiles of pleasure lighted their wayworn countenances as they beheld the waving fields of maize and the gleam of the distant cabins and their satisfaction was still further increased when the people of the station catching sight of them rushed out some mounted and others on foot to meet them uttering loud shouts of welcome such as in that day greeted every band of new comers and adding to the clamour of the reception a feu-de-joie which they fired in honour of the numbers and martial appearance of the present company the salutation was requited and the stirring hurrahs returned by the travellers most of whom pressed forward to the van in disorder eager to take part in the merry-making ere it was over or perhaps to seek for friends who had preceded them in the journey through the wilderness such friends were in many instances found and their loud and affectionate greetings were mingled with the scarce less cordial welcomes extended by the colonists even to the unknown stranger such was the reception of the emigrants at that period and in that country where men were united together by a sense of common danger and where every armed visitor besides being an accession to the strength of the colonists brought with him such news of absent friends and still remembered homes as was sure to recommend him to favour the only individual who on this occasion of rejoicing preserved a melancholy countenance and who instead of riding forward like the others to shake hands with the people of the station betrayed an inclination to avoid their greetings altogether was a young man who from the position he occupied in the band and from other causes was entitled to superior attention with the rank and nominal title of second-captain a dignity conferred upon him by his companions he was in reality the commander of the party the ostensible leader being although a man of good repute on the virginia border entirely wanting in the military reputation and skill which the other had acquired in the armies of the republics and of which the value was fully appreciated when danger first seemed to threaten the exiles on their march he was a youth of scarce twenty-three years of age but five of those years had been passed in camps and battles and the labours passions and privations of his profession had antedated the period of manhood a frame tall and athletic a countenance which although retaining the smoothness and freshness of youth was yet marked with the manly gravity and decision of mature life added in appearance at least six years to his age he wore a hunting-frock of the plainest green colour with cap and leggings of leather such as were worn by many of the poorest or least pretending exiles like whom also he bore a rifle on his shoulder with the horn and other equipments of a hunter there was little therefore to distinguish him at the first view from among his companions although his erect military bearing and the fine blooded bay horse which he rode would have won him more than a passing look the holsters at his saddle-bow and the sabre at his side were weapons not indeed very generally worn by frontiersmen but still common enough to prevent their being regarded as badges of rank with this youthful officer the rear-guard which he commanded having deserted him to press forward to the van there remained only three persons two of whom were negro slaves both mounted and armed that followed at a little distance behind leading thrice their number of pack-horses the third was a female who rode closely at his side the rein of her pony being in fact grasped in his hand though he looked as if scarce conscious that he held it a degree of insensibility that would have spoken little in his favour to an observer for his companion was both young and beautiful and watched his moody countenance on her part with looks of the most anxious and affectionate interest her riding-habit chosen like his own garments with more regard to usefulness than beauty and perhaps somewhat the worse for its encounters with the wind and forest could not conceal the graceful figure it defended nor had the sunbeam though it had darkened the bright complexion exposed to its summer fury during a journey of more than six weeks robbed her fair visage of a single charm there was in the general cast of features a sufficient resemblance between the two to indicate near relationship although it was plain that the gloom seated upon the brow of her kinsmen as if a permanent characteristic was an unwelcome and unnatural visitant on her own the clear blue eye the golden locks floating over her temples the ruddy cheek and look of seventeen and generally the frank and open character of her expression betokened a spirit too joyous and elastic to indulge in those dark anticipations of the future or mournful recollections of the past which clouded the bosom of her relative and well for her that such was the cheerful temper of her mind for it was manifest from her whole appearance that her lot as originally cast must have been among the gentle the refined and the luxurious and that she

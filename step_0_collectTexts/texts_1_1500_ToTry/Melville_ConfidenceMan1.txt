the confidence-man his masquerade a mute goes aboard a boat on the mississippi at sunrise on a first of april there appeared suddenly as manco capac at the lake titicaca a man in cream-colors at the water-side in the city of st louis his cheek was fair his chin downy his hair flaxen his hat a white fur one with a long fleecy nap he had neither trunk valise carpet-bag nor parcel no porter followed him he was unaccompanied by friends from the shrugged shoulders titters whispers wonderings of the crowd it was plain that he was in the extremest sense of the word a stranger in the same moment with his advent he stepped aboard the favorite steamer fidÂŠle on the point of starting for new orleans stared at but unsaluted with the air of one neither courting nor shunning regard but evenly pursuing the path of duty lead it through solitudes or cities he held on his way along the lower deck until he chanced to come to a placard nigh the captain's office offering a reward for the capture of a mysterious impostor supposed to have recently arrived from the east quite an original genius in his vocation as would appear though wherein his originality consisted was not clearly given but what purported to be a careful description of his person followed as if it had been a theatre-bill crowds were gathered about the announcement and among them certain chevaliers whose eyes it was plain were on the capitals or at least earnestly seeking sight of them from behind intervening coats but as for their fingers they were enveloped in some myth though during a chance interval one of these chevaliers somewhat showed his hand in purchasing from another chevalier ex-officio a peddler of money-belts one of his popular safe-guards while another peddler who was still another versatile chevalier hawked in the thick of the throng the lives of measan the bandit of ohio murrel the pirate of the mississippi and the brothers harpe the thugs of the green river country in kentucky creatures with others of the sort one and all exterminated at the time and for the most part like the hunted generations of wolves in the same regions leaving comparatively few successors which would seem cause for unalloyed gratulation and is such to all except those who think that in new countries where the wolves are killed off the foxes increase pausing at this spot the stranger so far succeeded in threading his way as at last to plant himself just beside the placard when producing a small slate and tracing some words upon it he held it up before him on a level with the placard so that they who read the one might read the other the words were these charity thinketh no evil as in gaining his place some little perseverance not to say persistence of a mildly inoffensive sort had been unavoidable it was not with the best relish that the crowd regarded his apparent intrusion and upon a more attentive survey perceiving no badge of authority about him but rather something quite the contrary he being of an aspect so singularly innocent an aspect too which they took to be somehow inappropriate to the time and place and inclining to the notion that his writing was of much the same sort in short taking him for some strange kind of simpleton harmless enough would he keep to himself but not wholly unobnoxious as an intruder they made no scruple to jostle him aside while one less kind than the rest or more of a wag by an unobserved stroke dexterously flattened down his fleecy hat upon his head without readjusting it the stranger quietly turned and writing anew upon the slate again held it up charity suffereth long and is kind illy pleased with his pertinacity as they thought it the crowd a second time thrust him aside and not without epithets and some buffets all of which were unresented but as if at last despairing of so difficult an adventure wherein one apparently a non-resistant sought to impose his presence upon fighting characters the stranger now moved slowly away yet not before altering his writing to this charity endureth all things shield-like bearing his slate before him amid stares and jeers he moved slowly up and down at his turning points again changing his inscription to charity believeth all things and then charity never faileth the word charity as originally traced remained throughout uneffaced not unlike the left-hand numeral of a printed date otherwise left for convenience in blank to some observers the singularity if not lunacy of the stranger was heightened by his muteness and perhaps also by the contrast to his proceedings afforded in the actions quite in the wonted and sensible order of things of the barber of the boat whose quarters under a smoking-saloon and over against a bar-room was next door but two to the captain's office as if the long wide covered deck hereabouts built up on both sides with shop-like windowed spaces were some constantinople arcade or bazaar where more than one trade is plied this river barber aproned and slippered but rather crusty-looking for the moment it may be from being newly out of bed was throwing open his premises for the day and suitably arranging the exterior with business-like dispatch having rattled down his shutters and at a palm-tree angle set out in the iron fixture his little ornamental pole and this without overmuch tenderness for the elbows and toes of the crowd he concluded his operations by bidding people stand still more aside when jumping on a stool he hung over his door on the customary nail a gaudy sort of illuminated pasteboard sign skillfully executed by himself gilt with the likeness of a razor elbowed in readiness to shave and also for the public benefit with two words not unfrequently seen ashore gracing other shops besides barbers no trust an inscription which though in a sense not less intrusive than the contrasted ones of the stranger did not as it seemed provoke any corresponding derision or surprise much less indignation and still less to all appearances did it gain for the inscriber the repute of being a simpleton meanwhile he with the slate continued moving slowly up and down not without causing some stares to change into jeers and some jeers into pushes and some pushes into punches when suddenly in one of his turns he was hailed from behind by two porters carrying a large trunk but as the summons though loud was without effect they accidentally or otherwise swung their burden against him nearly overthrowing him when by a quick start a peculiar inarticulate moan and a pathetic telegraphing of his fingers he involuntarily betrayed that he was not alone dumb but also deaf presently as if not wholly unaffected by his reception thus far he went forward seating himself in a retired spot on the forecastle nigh the foot of a ladder there leading to a deck above up and down which ladder some of the boatmen in discharge of their duties were occasionally going from his betaking himself to this humble quarter it was evident that as a deck-passenger the stranger simple though he seemed was not entirely ignorant of his place though his taking a deck-passage might have been partly for convenience as from his having no luggage it was probable that his destination was one of the small wayside landings within a few hours sail but though he might not have a long way to go yet he seemed already to have come from a very long distance though neither soiled nor slovenly his cream-colored suit had a tossed look almost linty as if traveling night and day from some far country beyond the prairies he had long been without the solace of a bed his aspect was at once gentle and jaded and from the moment of seating himself increasing in tired abstraction and dreaminess gradually overtaken by slumber his flaxen head drooped his whole lamb-like figure relaxed and half reclining against the ladder's foot lay motionless as some sugar-snow in march which softly stealing down over night with its white placidity startles the brown farmer peering out from his threshold at daybreak showing that many men have many minds odd fish poor fellow who can he be casper hauser bless my soul uncommon

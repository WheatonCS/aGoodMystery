ormond or the secret witness chapter i stephen dudley was a native of new york he was educated to the profession of a painter his father's trade was that of an apothecary but this son manifesting an attachment to the pencil he was resolved that it should be gratified for this end stephen was sent at an early age to europe and not only enjoyed the instructions of fuzeli and bartolozzi but spent a considerable period in italy in studying the augustan and medicean monuments it was intended that he should practise his art in his native city but the young man though reconciled to this scheme by deference to paternal authority and by a sense of its propriety was willing as long as possible to postpone it the liberality of his father relieved him from all pecuniary cares his whole time was devoted to the improvement of his skill in his favourite art and the enriching of his mind with every valuable accomplishment he was endowed with a comprehensive genius and indefatigable industry his progress was proportionably rapid and he passed his time without much regard to futurity being too well satisfied with the present to anticipate a change a change however was unavoidable and he was obliged at length to pay a reluctant obedience to his father's repeated summons the death of his wife had rendered his society still more necessary to the old gentleman he married before his return the woman whom he had selected was an unportioned orphan and was recommended merely by her moral qualities these however were eminent and secured to her till the end of her life the affection of her husband though painting was capable of fully gratifying his taste as matter of amusement he quickly found that in his new situation it would not answer the ends of a profession his father supported himself by the profits of his shop but with all his industry he could do no more than procure a subsistence for himself and his son till his father's death young dudley attached himself to painting his gains were slender but he loved the art and his father's profession rendered his own exertions in a great degree superfluous the death of the elder dudley introduced an important change in his situation it thenceforth became necessary to strike into some new path to deny himself the indulgence of his inclinations and regulate his future exertions by a view to nothing but gain there was little room for choice his habits had disqualified him for mechanical employments he could not stoop to the imaginary indignity which attended them nor spare the time necessary to obtain the requisite degree of skill his father died in possession of some stock and a sufficient portion of credit to supply its annual decays he lived at what they call a good stand and enjoyed a certain quantity of permanent custom the knowledge that was required was as easily obtained as the elements of any other profession and was not wholly unallied to the pursuits in which he had sometimes engaged hence he could not hesitate long in forming his resolution but assumed the management of his father's concerns with a cheerful and determined spirit the knowledge of his business was acquired in no long time he was stimulated to the acquisition by a sense of duty he was inured to habits of industry and there were few things capable to resist a strenuous exertion of his faculties knowledge of whatever kind afforded a compensation to labour but the task being finished that which remained which in ordinary apprehensions would have been esteemed an easy and smooth path was to him insupportably disgustful the drudgery of a shop where all the faculties were at a stand and one day was an unvaried repetition of the foregoing was too incongenial to his disposition not to be a source of discontent this was an evil which it was the tendency of time to increase rather than diminish the longer he endured it the less tolerable it became he could not forbear comparing his present situation with his former and deriving from the contrast perpetual food for melancholy the indulgence of his father had contributed to instil into him prejudices in consequence of which a certain species of disgrace was annexed to every employment of which the only purpose was gain his present situation not only precluded all those pursuits which exalt and harmonize the feelings but was detested by him as something humiliating and ignominious his wife was of a pliant temper and her condition less influenced by this change than that of her husband she was qualified to be his comforter but instead of dispelling his gloom by judicious arguments or a seasonable example of vivacity she caught the infection that preyed upon his mind and augmented his anxieties by partaking in them by enlarging in some degree the foundation on which his father had built he had provided the means of a future secession and might console himself with the prospect of enjoying his darling ease at some period of his life this period was necessarily too remote for his wishes and had not certain occurrences taken place by which he was flattered with the immediate possession of ease it is far from being certain that he would not have fallen a victim to his growing disquietudes he was one morning engaged behind his counter as usual when a youth came into his shop and in terms that bespoke the union of fearlessness and frankness inquired whether he could be engaged as an apprentice a proposal of this kind could not be suddenly rejected or adopted he stood in need of assistance the youth was manly and blooming and exhibited a modest and ingenuous aspect it was possible that he was in every respect qualified for the post for which he applied but it was previously necessary to ascertain these qualifications for this end he requested the youth to call at his house in the evening when he should be at leisure to converse with him and furnished him with suitable directions the youth came according to appointment on being questioned as to his birthplace and origin he stated that he was a native of wakefield in yorkshire that his family were honest and his education not mean that he was the eldest of many children and having attained an age at which he conceived it his duty to provide for himself he had with the concurrence of his friends come to america in search of the means of independent subsistence that he had just arrived in a ship which he named and his scanty stock of money being likely to be speedily consumed this had been the first effort he had made to procure employment his tale was circumstantial and consistent and his veracity appeared liable to no doubt he was master of his book and his pen and had acquired more than the rudiments of latin mr dudley did not require much time to deliberate in a few days the youth was established as a member of his family and as a coadjutor in his shop nothing but food clothing and lodging being stipulated as the reward of his services the young man improved daily in the good opinion of his master his apprehension was quick his sobriety invariable and his application incessant though by no means presumptuous or arrogant he was not wanting in a suitable degree of self-confidence all his propensities appeared to concentre in his occupation and the promotion of his master's interest from which he was drawn aside by no allurements of sensual or intellectual pleasure in a short time he was able to relieve his master of most of the toils of his profession and mr dudley a thousand times congratulated himself on possessing a servant equally qualified by his talents and his probity he gradually remitted his attention to his own concerns and placed more absolute reliance on the fidelity of his dependant young craig that was the name of the youth maintained a punctual correspondence with his family and confided to his patron not only copies of all the letters which he himself wrote but those which from time to time he received he had several correspondents but the chief of those were his mother and his eldest sister the sentiments contained in their letters breathed the most appropriate simplicity and tenderness and flowed with the nicest propriety from the different relationships of mother and sister the style and even the penmanship were distinct and characteristical one of the first of these epistles was written by the mother to mr dudley on being informed by her son of his present engagement it was dictated by that concern for the welfare of her child befitting the maternal character gratitude for the ready acceptance of the youth's services and for the benignity of his deportment towards him a

on my last voyage to the west indies a friend whom i met after a long separation related to me the following adventure and as it appeared singular and romantic i made a memorandum of it and i now transcribe it from my log book for your use which you are at liberty to do with as you may deem proper yours w h p the pirate i went to the havana in the summer of - on business and having settled it to my satisfaction engaged my passage in a vessel bound to new york - we had been but a few hours on the voyage when i felt that weariness an pain which indicates the approach of the yellow fever i continued to grow worse and to add to my distress the vessel began to roll violently and sea-sickness with all its horrors came upon me i would have sacrificed every thing for a quiet place in which to die as i felt that this was all i could wish for overcome at length with weakness and completely exhausted i fell asleep from which i was awakened by a confused noise i at first believed it was merely imagination but as it became louder i felt convinced that what i heard was a reality at length the cabin door opened and several persons descended our captain approached my birth and told me the vessel had been captured by pirates and that we were now standing in foe the land i heard the first part of his speech with an apathy which my illness only can account for - but the very name of land seemed to operate like a charm upon me a young man now approached and told me to be under no apprehension as no personal injury was intended and that every care should be bestowed upon me he inquired the nature and state of my disease and brought me a cordial which considerably relieved me in a short time we were at anchor and i was told our vessel would be detained for a day or two and after a few articles had been taken out permitted to proceed on her voyage the same person subsequently entered and observed that i could be much better attended on shore where i would be relieved form the bustle and confusion of the vessel to this i cheerfully assented and in the afternoon i was placed in a boat and carried to a hut near the beach - here i was treated kindly and every attention paid me i had been three days on shore when the young man whom i now discovered to be captain of the corsair arrived and told me our vessel would sail in an hour and if i wished to proceed in her i was at liberty to do so although he remarked in my present state it would no doubt cost me my life - and that if i would trust to him and could bear the detention of a month or so he would convey me to some part of cuba from whence i could easily procure a passage home believing a removal in my present state would be almost certain death added to a strong desire to know more of a man who appeared so different from what i had heard of men engaged in the profession with which he was connected made me assent to his proposal in about a week i was decidedly convalescent and i felt really grateful for the kindness of the youthful outlaw on evening on entering m room he expressed himself gratified to see me so much recovered as he was to sail in the morning for the other side of the islands and it was his wish that i should accompany him as it was likely he would fall in with some vessel bound to the united states and i could thus get home the next morning we were underweigh it was near midnight when i was awakened by a deep groan in the cabin in which i slept i raised my head and perceived the captain gazing on a small but beautiful dagger which he was holding to the light as if to see more plainly before him on the table as well as i could judge lay a miniature he was in tears and appeared much affected in a few moments he placed them in his desk and went on deck i mused some time on the singularity of this man who seem fitted for a situation better than that of a piratical captain - he was rather small in his person but well formed had been handsome i should think but sorrow seemed to have set her seal upon his brow his hair exhibited the marks of premature old age although he could not be more than twenty-three the next night i determined to watch and see if he would again look at the dagger he at length came down and after sitting some time in a contemplative posture opened the desk and again the dagger met my eye curiosity could bear it no longer what a singularly beautiful dirk i exclaimed he started as if he had been shot but suddenly recovering himself said with a look which seemed as if he would reach my very thoughts why did you make that remark i felt abashed but he immediately added since you appear anxious to know my history i will tell it you do you see that he exclaimed as he moved the light nearer and placed the dagger before me this blood i answered sickening at the sight ay tis blood blood to save one drop of which i would give all this miserable body contains and yet added he wildly twas i that shed it he buried his face in his hands and groaned deeply in a few moments he became more composed and began his story the events of my boyhood i pass over suffice it to say i lost my parents at an early age and was left to the care of a relation i received a good education and knew sorrow but by name until i had attained my eighteenth year i then began a new existence i was in love yes if ever a man loved passionately intensely - i did i was singular romantic in my ideas an rosalie was equally so i will pass over the few happy hours of our affection they would be tedious and i would not wish to bring them to my mind too forcibly she promised me her hand and declared that none but myself should ever posses it oh my friend you are young but beware how you entrust your heart and happiness into the keeping of a woman it is this that has brought me to what i am a wretched outcast a murderer a broken-hearted desperate being the perspiration stood in large drops on his forehead after a pause of a moment he continued i was too much restricted by poetry to marry but i believed that i possessed talents which would place me beyond the reach of its effects i accordingly embraced an offer from a friend to engage in a trading voyage to the west indies and as my health was delicate my friends considered the climate wold restore my frame to its usual vigor i bade a farewell to home and to rosalie that kiss that farewell kiss was our last we were detained nearly a year trading to different ports and although i written home every opportunity had never received an answer it was with such feelings of rapturous joy which language is incapable of defining that i saw our vessel fast approaching my native land a thousand endearing recollections rushed on my mind the thought that my rosalie was false had never entered my brain i would have blushed if it had done so i was night when our boat landed me at the wharf and i flew with a beating heart towards her dwelling i forgot to mention the dagger i purchased it with some other trinkets on account of its beauty and had that day carelessly put it in my waistcoat pocket there were lights in the front of the house and i heard i wished to see her alone and went to the garden gate every thing reminded me of the blissful hours i had passed i walked towards the servants houses intending to get one of them to carry a message to rose the first one i met had often carried letters between us but she did not recognize me until i spoke when she exclaimed o lord master edgar is it you miss rose is to be married in half an hour and burst into tears i have often since been surprised at my own firmness for i listened calmly to her tale

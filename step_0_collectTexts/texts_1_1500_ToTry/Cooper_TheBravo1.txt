i stood in venice on the bridge sighs a palace and a prison on each hand i saw from out the wave her structures rise as from the stroke the enchanter s wand a thousand years their cloudy wings expand around me and a dying glory smiles o er the far times when many a subject land look d to the winged lions marble piles where venice sate in state throned on her hundred isles byron the sun had disappeared behind the summits the tyrolean alps and the moon was already risen above the low barrier the lido hundreds pedestrians were pouring out the narrow streets venice into the square st mark like water gushing through some strait aqueduct into a broad and bubbling basin gallant cavalier and grave cittadini soldiers dalmatia and seamen the galleys dames the city and females lighter manners jewellers the rialto and traders from the levant jew turk and christian traveller adventurer podesta valet advocate and gondolier held their way alike to the common centre amusement the hurried air and careless eye the measured step and jealous glance the jest and laugh the song the cantatrice and the melody the flute the grimace the buffoon and the tragic frown the improvisatore the pyramid the

objects the place rendered the scene the most remarkable christendom on the very confines that line which separates western from eastern europe and in constant communication with the latter venice possessed a greater admixture character and costume than any other the numerous ports that region a portion this peculiarity is still to be observed under the fallen fortunes the place but at the period our tale the city the isles though no longer mistress the mediterranean nor even the adriatic was still rich and powerful her influence was felt in the councils the civilized world and her commerce though waning was yet sufficient to uphold the vast possessions those families whose ancestors had become rich in the day her prosperity men lived among her islands in that state incipient lethargy which marks the progress a downward course whether the decline be a moral or a physical decay at the hour we have named the vast parallelogram the piazza was filling fast the cafes and casinos within the porticoes which surround three its sides being already thronged with company while all beneath the arches was gay and brilliant with the flare torch and lamp the noble range edifices called the procurators the massive pile the ducal palace the most ancient christian church the granite columns the piazzetta the triumphal masts the great square and the giddy tower the campanile were slumbering in the more mellow glow the moon facing the wide area the great square stood the quaint and venerable cathedral san marco a temple trophies and one equally proclaiming the prowess and the piety its founders this remarkable structure presided over the other fixtures the place like a monument the republic s antiquity the bravo ii and greatness its saracenic architecture the rows precious but useless little columns that load its front the low asiatic domes which rest upon its walls in the repose a thousand years the rude and gaudy mosaics and above all the captured horses corinth which start from out the sombre mass in the glory grecian art received from the solemn and appropriate light a character melancholy and mystery that well comported with the thick recollections which crowd the mind as the eye gazes at this rare relic the past as fit companions to this edifice the other peculiar ornaments the place stood at hand the base the campanile lay in shadow but a hundred feet its gray summit received the full rays the moon along its eastern face the masts destined to bear the conquered ensigns candia constantinople and the morea cut the air by its side in dark and fairy lines while at the extremity the smaller square and near the margin the sea the forms the winged lion and the patron saint the city each on his column african granite were distinctly traced against the background the azure sky it was near the base the former these massive blocks stone that one stood who seemed to gaze at the animated and striking scene with the listlessness and indifference satiety a multitude some in masques and others careless being known had poured along the quay into the piazzetta on their way to the principal square while this individual had scarce turned a glance aside or changed a limb in weariness his attitude was that patient practised and obedient waiting on another s pleasure with folded arms a bod poised on one leg and a vacant though goodhumored eye lie appeared to attend some beck authority ere lie quitted the spot a silken jacket in wr shakspearethe evening such a day in a city with the habits venice was not likely to be spent in the dullness retirement the great sqinfre st mark was again filled with its active and motley crowd and the scenes already described in the opening chapters this work were resumed if possible with more apparent devotion to the levities the hour than on the occasion mentioned the tumblers and jugglers renewed their antics the cries the fruitsellers and other venders light luxuries were again mingled with the tones the flute and the notes the guitar and harp while the idle and the busy the thoughtless and the designing the conspirator and the agent the police once more met in privileged security the night had advanced beyond its turn when a gondola came gliding through the shipping the port with that easy and sw t anlike motion which is peculiar to its slow movement and touched the quay with its beak at the point w here the canal st mark forms its junction w with the bay thou art welcome antonio said one who approached the solitary individual that had directed tke gondola when the latter had thrust the iron spike his painter between the crevices the stones as gondoliers are accustomed to secure their barges thou art welcome antonio though late i

prayed i ought not to thank thee the bravo less thou hast thyself been borne hard upon by the world or thou would st not have bethought thee an old and despised man when the shouts triumph were ringing in thy ear and when thy own young blood was stirred with the feelings pride and victory nature gives thee strong language fisherman i have not passed the hours truly in the games and levities my years life has been no festa to me but no matter the seriate was not pleased to hear lessening the number the galleys crew and thou wilt bethink thee some other reward i have here the chain and golden oar in the hope that it will still be welcome antonio looked amazed but yielding to a natural curiosity he gazed a moment with a longing at the prize then recoiling with a shudder he uttered moodily and with the tones one whose determination was made i should think the bauble coined my grandchild s blood keep it they have trusted it to thee for it is thine right and now that they refuse to hear my prayer it will be useless to all but to him who fairly earned it thou makes no allowance fisherman for difference years and for sinews that are in their vigor methinks that in adjudging such a prize thought should be had to these matters and then wouldest thou be found outstripping us all holy st theodore i passed my childhood with the oar in hand and never before have i met one in

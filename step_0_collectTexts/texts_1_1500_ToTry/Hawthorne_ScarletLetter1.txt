the custom-house introductory to the scarlet letter it is a little remarkable thatthough disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside and to my personal friendsan autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me in addressing the public the first time was three or four years since when i favored the readerinexcusably and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imaginewith a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an old manse and nowbecause beyond my deserts i was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasioni again seize the public by the button and talk of my three years experience in a custom-house the example of the famous p p clerk of this parish was never more faithfully followed the truth seems to be however that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind the author addresses not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates some authors indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy as if the printed book thrown at large on the wide world were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer's own nature and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it it is scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally but as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the closest friend is listening to our talk and then a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind its veil to this extent and within these limits an author methinks may be autobiographical without violating either the reader's rights or his own it will be seen likewise that this custom-house sketch has a certain propriety of a kind always recognized in literature as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained this in facta desire to put myself in my true position as editor or very little more of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volumethis and no other is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public in accomplishing the main purpose it has appeared allowable by a few extra touches to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described together with some of the characters that move in it among whom the author happened to make one in my native town of salem at the head of what half a century ago in the days of old king derby was a bustling wharfbut which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life except perhaps a bark or brig half-way down its melancholy length discharging hides or nearer at hand a nova scotia schooner pitching out her cargo of firewoodat the head i say of this dilapidated wharf which the tide often overflows and along which at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grasshere with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect and thence across the harbor stands a spacious edifice of brick from the loftiest point of its roof during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon floats or droops in breeze or calm the banner of the republic but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically instead of horizontally and thus indicating that a civil and not a military post of uncle sam's government is here established its front is ornamented with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars supporting a balcony beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the american eagle with outspread wings a shield before her breast and if i recollect aright a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw with the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye and the general truculency of her attitude to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings nevertheless vixenly as she looks many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle imagining i presume that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eider-down pillow but she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods and sooner or lateroftener soon than lateis apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw a dab of her beak or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows the pavement round about the above-described edificewhich we may as well name at once as the custom-house of the porthas grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not of late days been worn by any multitudinous resort of business in some months of the year however there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with england when salem was a port by itself not scorned as she is now by her own merchants and ship-owners who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston on some such morning when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at onceusually from africa or south americaor to be on the verge of their departure thitherward there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps here before his own wife has greeted him you may greet the sea-flushed shipmaster just in port with his vessel's papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box here too comes his owner cheerful or sombre gracious or in the sulks accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of here likewisethe germ of the wrinkle-browed grizzly-bearded care-worn merchantwe have the smart young clerk who gets the taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood and already sends adventures in his master's ships when he had better be sailing mimic-boats upon a mill-pond another figure in the scene is the outward-bound sailor in quest of a protection or the recently arrived one pale and feeble seeking a passport to the hospital nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the british provinces a rough-looking set of tarpaulins without the alertness of the yankee aspect but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade cluster all these individuals together as they sometimes were with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group and for the time being it made the custom-house a stirring scene more frequently however on ascending the steps you would discernin the entry if it were summer time or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathera row of venerable figures sitting in old-fashioned chairs which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall oftentimes they were asleep but occasionally might be heard talking together in voices between speech and a snore and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity on monopolized labor or anything else but their own independent exertions these old gentlemenseated like matthew at the receipt of customs but not very liable to be summoned thence like him for apostolic errandswere custom-house officers furthermore on the left hand as you enter the front door is a certain room or office about fifteen feet square and of a lofty height with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf and the third looking across a narrow lane and along a portion of derby street all three give glimpses of the shops of grocers block-makers slop-sellers and ship-chandlers around the doors of which are generally to be seen laughing and

from mosses from an old manse the birthmark in the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one he had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant cleared his fine countenance from the furnace smoke washed the stain of acids from his fingers and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife in those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy the higher intellect the imagination the spirit and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which as some of their ardent votaries believed would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself we know not whether aylmer possessed this degree of faith in man's ultimate control over nature he had devoted himself however too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion his love for his young wife might prove the stronger of the two but it could only be by intertwining itself with his love of science and uniting the strength of the latter to his own such a union accordingly took place and was attended with truly remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral one day very soon after their marriage aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke georgiana said he has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed no indeed said she smiling but perceiving the seriousness of his manner she blushed deeply to tell you the truth it has been so often called a charm that i was simple enough to imagine it might be so ah upon another face perhaps it might replied her husband but never on yours no dearest georgiana you came so nearly perfect from the hand of nature that this slightest possible defect which we hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty shocks me as being the visible mark of earthly imperfection shocks you my husband cried georgiana deeply hurt at first reddening with momentary anger but then bursting into tears then why did you take me from my mother's side you cannot love what shocks you to explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of georgiana's left cheek there was a singular mark deeply interwoven as it were with the texture and substance of her face in the usual state of her complexion a healthy though delicate bloom the mark wore a tint of deeper crimson which imperfectly defined its shape amid the surrounding rosiness when she blushed it gradually became more indistinct and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow but if any shifting motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again a crimson stain upon the snow in what aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful distinctness its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand though of the smallest pygmy size georgiana's lovers were wont to say that some fairy at her birth hour had laid her tiny hand upon the infant's cheek and left this impress there in token of the magic endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts many a desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing his lips to the mysterious hand it must not be concealed however that the impression wrought by this fairy sign manual varied exceedingly according to the difference of temperament in the beholders some fastidious persons but they were exclusively of her own sex affirmed that the bloody hand as they chose to call it quite destroyed the effect of georgiana's beauty and rendered her countenance even hideous but it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary marble would convert the eve of powers to a monster masculine observers if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration contented themselves with wishing it away that the world might possess one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw after his marriage for he thought little or nothing of the matter before aylmer discovered that this was the case with himself had she been less beautiful if envy's self could have found aught else to sneer at he might have felt his affection heightened by the prettiness of this mimic hand now vaguely portrayed now lost now stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of emotion that throbbed within her heart but seeing her otherwise so perfect he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives it was the fatal flaw of humanity which nature in one shape or another stamps ineffaceably on all her productions either to imply that they are temporary and finite or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain the crimson hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould degrading them into kindred with the lowest and even with the very brutes like whom their visible frames return to dust in this manner selecting it as the symbol of his wife's liability to sin sorrow decay and death aylmer's sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object causing him more trouble and horror than ever georgiana's beauty whether of soul or sense had given him delight at all the seasons which should have been their happiest he invariably and without intending it nay in spite of a purpose to the contrary reverted to this one disastrous topic trifling as it at first appeared it so connected itself with innumerable trains of thought and modes of feeling that it became the central point of all with the morning twilight aylmer opened his eyes upon his wife's face and recognized the symbol of imperfection and when they sat together at the evening hearth his eyes wandered stealthily to her cheek and beheld flickering with the blaze of the wood fire the spectral hand that wrote mortality where he would fain have worshipped georgiana soon learned to shudder at his gaze it needed but a glance with the peculiar expression that his face often wore to change the roses of her cheek into a deathlike paleness amid which the crimson hand was brought strongly out like a bass-relief of ruby on the whitest marble late one night when the lights were growing dim so as hardly to betray the stain on the poor wife's cheek she herself for the first time voluntarily took up the subject do you remember my dear aylmer said she with a feeble attempt at a smile have you any recollection of a dream last night about this odious hand none none whatever replied aylmer starting but then he added in a dry cold tone affected for the sake of concealing the real depth of his emotion i might well dream of it for before i fell asleep it had taken a pretty firm hold of my fancy and you did dream of it continued georgiana hastily for she dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt what she had to say a terrible dream i wonder that you can forget it is it possible to forget this one expression it is in her heart now we must have it out reflect my husband for by all means i would have you recall that dream the mind is in a sad state when sleep the all-involving cannot confine her spectres within the dim region of her sway but suffers them to break forth affrighting this actual life with secrets that perchance belong to a deeper one aylmer now remembered his dream he had fancied himself with his servant aminadab attempting an operation for the removal of the birthmark but the deeper went the knife the deeper sank the hand until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have caught hold of georgiana's heart whence however her husband was inexorably resolved to cut or wrench it away when the dream had shaped itself perfectly in his memory aylmer sat in his wife's presence with a guilty feeling truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious self-deception during our waking moments until now

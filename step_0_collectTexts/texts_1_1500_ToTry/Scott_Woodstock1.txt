some were for gospel ministers and some for redcoat secular as men most fit t hold forth the word and wield the one and th other sword butler's hudihras there is a handsome parish church in the town woodstock i am told so at least for i never saw it having scarce time when at the place to view the magnificence blenheim its painted halls and tapestried bowers and then return indue season to dine in hall with my learned friend the provost being one those occasions on which a man wrongs himself extremely if he lets his curiosity interfere with his punctuality i had the church accurately described to me with woodstock a view to this work but as i have some reason to doubt whether my informant had ever seen the inside it himself i will be content to say that it is now a handsome edifice most part which was rebuilt forty or fifty years since although it still contains some arches the old chantry founded it is said by king john but it is to this more ancient part the building that my story refers upon a morning in the september or beginning october in the year being a day appointed for a solemn thanksgiving for the decisive victory at worcester a respectable audience was assembled in the old chantry or chapel king john the condition the church and character the audience both bore witness to the rage civil war and the peculiar spirit the times the sacred edifice showed many marks dilapidation the windows once filled with stained glass had been dashed to pieces with pikes and muskets as matters and pertaining to idolatry the carving on the readingdesk was damaged and two fair screens beautiful sculptured oak had been destroyed for the same woodstock pithy and conclusive reason the high altar had been removed and the gilded railing which was once around it was broken down and carried off the effigies several tombs were mutilated and now lay scattered about the church torn from their destined niche unworthy meed knightly counsel or heroic deed the autumn wind piped through empty aisles in which the remains stakes and premisses roughhewn timber as well as a quantity scattered hay and trampled straw seemed to intimate that the hallowed precincts had been upon some late emergency made the quarters a troop horse the audience like the building was abated in splendour none the ancient and habitual worshippers during peaceful times were now to seen in their carved galleries with hands shadowing their brows while composing their minds to pray where their fathers had prayed and after the same mode worship the eye the yeoman and peasant sought in vain the tall form old sir henry lee ditchley as wrapped in his laced cloak and with beard and whiskers duly composed he moved slowly through the woodstock aisles followed by the faithful raastiflp or bloodhound which in old time had saved his master by his fidelity and which regularly followed him to church bevis indeed fell under the proverb which avers he is a good dog which goes to church f for bating an occasional temptation to warble along with the accord he behaved himself as decorously as any the congregation and returned as much edified perhaps as some them the damsels woodstock looked as vainly for the laced cloaks jingling spurs slashed boots and tall plumes the young cavaliers this and other highborn houses moving through the streets and the churchyard with the careless ease which indicates perhaps rather an overweening degree selfconfidence yet shows graceful when mingled with good humour and courtesy the good old dames too in their white hoods and black velvet gowns their daughters the cynosure neighbouring eyes where were they all now who when they entered the church used to divide men's thoughts between them and heaven but ah alice lee so sweet so gentle so condescending in thy woodstock loveliness thus proceeds a contemporary annalist whose manuscript we have deciphered why is my story to turn upon thy fallen fortunes and why not rather to the period when in the very dismounting from your palfrey you attracted as many eyes as if an angel had descended as many blessings as if the benignant being had come fraught with good tidings no creature wert thou an idle romancers imagination no being fantastically bedizened with inconsistent perfections thy merits made me love thee well and for thy faults i think they made me love thee better with the

growth puritanism which was more general in the neighbouring counties there were among the congregation however one or two that by their habits and demeanour seemed country gentlemen consideration and there were also present some the notables the town woodstock cutlers or glovers chiefly whose skill in woodstock steel or leather had raised them to a comfortable livelihood these dignitaries wore long black cloaks plaited close at the neck and like peaceful citizens carried their bibles and membrane at their girdles instead knife or sword this respectable but least numerous part the audience were such decent persons as had adopted the presbyterian form faith renouncing the liturgy and hierarchy the church england and using under the tuition the rev nehemiah holdenough much famed for the length and strength his powers predication with these grave seniors sate their goodly dames in ruff and gorget like the portraits which in catalogues paintings are designed wife a burghmaster and their pretty daughters whose study like that chaucers physician was not always in the bible but who were on the contrary when a glance could escape the vigilance their honoured mothers inattentive themselves and the cause inattention in others but besides these dignified persons there were in the church a numerous collection the lower orders some brought thither by curiosity but many them unwashed artificers bee woodstock wintered in the theological discussions the time and as many various sects as there are colours in the rainbow the presumption these learned thebes being in exact proportion to their ignorance the last was total and the first boundless their behaviour in the church was anything but reverential or edifying most them affected a cynical contempt for all that was only held sacred by human sanction the church was to these men but a steeplehouse the clergyy man an ordinary person her ordinances dry bran and sapless pottage unfitted for the spiritualized palates the saints and the prayer an address to heaven to which each acceded or not as in his too critical judgment he conceived fit the elder amongst them sate or lay on the benches with their high

commences besides all these the congregation contained a few soldiers some in corslet and steel caps some in buff and others in red coats these men war had their chandeliers with ammunition slung round them and rested on their pikes and muskets they too had their peculiar doctrines on the most difficult points religion and united the extravagances enthusiasm with the most determined courage and resolution in the field the burghers woodstock looked on these military saints with no small degree awe for though not often sullied with deeds plunder or cruelty they had the power both absolutely in their hands and the peaceful citizens had no alternative save submission to whatever the illregulated and enthusiastic imaginations their martial guides might suggest after some time spent in waiting for him mr holdenough began to walk up the aisles the chapel not with the slow and dignified carriage with which the old rector was yore wont to maintain the dignity the surplice but with a woodstock hasty step like one who arrives too late at an appointment and bustles forward to make the best use his time he was a tall thin man with an adust complexion and the vivacity his eye indicated some irascibility temperament his dress was brown not black and over his other vestments he wore in honour calvin a geneva cloak a blue colour which fell backward from his shoulders as he posted on to the pulpit his grizzled hair was cut as short as shears could perform the feat and covered with a black silk skullcap which stuck so close to his head that the two ears expanded from

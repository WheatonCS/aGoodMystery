knickerbocker's history of new york containing divers ingenious theories and philosophic speculations concerning the creation and population of the world as connected with the history of new york according to the best authorities the world in which we dwell is a huge opaque reflecting inanimate mass floating in the vast ethereal ocean of infinite space it has the form of an orange being an oblate spheroid curiously flattened at opposite parts for the insertion of two imaginary poles which are supposed to penetrate and unite at the center thus forming an axis on which the mighty orange turns with a regular diurnal revolution the transitions of light and darkness whence proceed the alternations of day and night are produced by this diurnal revolution successively presenting the different parts of the earth to the rays of the sun the latter is according to the best that is to say the latest accounts a luminous or fiery body of a prodigious magnitude from which this world is driven by a centrifugal or repelling power and to which it is drawn by a centripetal or attractive force otherwise called the attraction of gravitation the combination or rather the counteraction of these two opposing impulses producing a circular and annual revolution hence result the different seasons of the year viz spring summer autumn and winter this i believe to be the most approved modern theory on the subject though there be many philosophers who have entertained very different opinions some too of them entitled to much deference from their great antiquity and illustrious characters thus it was advanced by some of the ancient sages that the earth was an extended plain supported by vast pillars and by others that it rested on the head of a snake or the back of a huge tortoise but as they did not provide a resting place for either the pillars or the tortoise the whole theory fell to the ground for want of proper foundation the brahmins assert that the heavens rest upon the earth and the sun and moon swim therein like fishes in the water moving from east to west by day and gliding along the edge of the horizon to their original stations during the night while according to the pauranicas of india it is a vast plain encircled by seven oceans of mild nectar and other delicious liquids that it is studded with seven mountains and ornamented in the center by a mountainous rock of burnished gold and that a great dragon occasionally swallows up the moon which accounts for the phenomena of lunar eclipses beside these and many other equally sage opinions we have the profound conjectures of aboul-hassan-aly son of al khan son of aly son of abderrahman son of abdallah son of masoud el-hadheli who is commonly called masoudi and surnamed cothbeddin but who takes the humble title of laheb-ar-rasoul which means the companion of the ambassador of god he has written a universal history entitled mouroudge-ed-dharab or the golden meadows and the mines of precious stones in this valuable work he has related the history of the world from the creation down to the moment of writing which was under the khaliphat of mothi billah in the month dgioumadi-el-aoual of the th year of the hegira or flight of the prophet he informs us that the earth is a huge bird mecca and medina constitute the head persia and india the right wing the land of gog the left wing and africa the tail he informs us moreover that an earth has existed before the present which he considers as a mere chicken of years that it has undergone divers deluges and that according to the opinion of some well-informed brahmins of his acquaintance it will be renovated every seventy thousandth hazarouam each hazarouam consisting of years these are a few of the many contradictory opinions of philosophers concerning the earth and we find that the learned have had equal perplexity as to the nature of the sun some of the ancient philosophers have affirmed that it is a vast wheel of brilliant fire others that it is merely a mirror or sphere of transparent crystal and a third class at the head of whom stands anaxagoras maintained that it was nothing but a huge ignited mass of iron or stone indeed he declared the heavens to be merely a vault of stone and that the stars were stones whirled upward from the earth and set on fire by the velocity of its revolutions but i give little attention to the doctrines of this philosopher the people of athens having fully refuted them by banishing him from their city a concise mode of answering unwelcome doctrines much resorted to in former days another sect of philosophers do declare that certain fiery particles exhale constantly from the earth which concentrating in a single point of the firmament by day constitute the sun but being scattered and rambling about in the dark at night collect in various points and form stars these are regularly burnt out and extinguished not unlike to the lamps in our streets and require a fresh supply of exhalations for the next occasion it is even recorded that at certain remote and obscure periods in consequence of a great scarcity of fuel the sun has been completely burnt out and sometimes not rekindled for a month at a time a most melancholy circumstance the very idea of which gave vast concern to heraclitus that worthy weeping philosopher of antiquity in addition to these various speculations it was the opinion of herschel that the sun is a magnificent habitable abode the light it furnishes arising from certain empyreal luminous or phosphoric clouds swimming in its transparent atmosphere but we will not enter further at present into the nature of the sun that being an inquiry not immediately necessary to the development of this history neither will we embroil ourselves in any more of the endless disputes of philosophers touching the form of this globe but content ourselves with the theory advanced in the beginning of this chapter and will proceed to illustrate by experiment the complexity of motion therein described to this our rotatory planet professor von poddingcoft or puddinghead as the name may be rendered into english was long celebrated in the university of leyden for profound gravity of deportment and a talent at going to sleep in the midst of examinations to the infinite relief of his hopeful students who thereby worked their way through college with great ease and little study in the course of one of his lectures the learned professor seizing a bucket of water swung it around his head at arm's length the impulse with which he threw the vessel from him being a centrifugal force the retention of his arm operating as a centripetal power and the bucket which was a substitute for the earth describing a circular orbit round about the globular head and ruby visage of professor von poddingcoft which formed no bad representation of the sun all of these particulars were duly explained to the class of gaping students around him he apprised them moreover that the same principle of gravitation which retained the water in the bucket restrains the ocean from flying from the earth in its rapid revolutions and he farther informed them that should the motion of the earth be suddenly checked it would incontinently fall into the sun through the centripetal force of gravitation a most ruinous event to this planet and one which would also obscure though it most probably would not extinguish the solar luminary an unlucky stripling one of those vagrant geniuses who seem sent into the world merely to annoy worthy men of the puddinghead order desirous of ascertaining the correctness of the experiment suddenly arrested the arm of the professor just at the moment that the bucket was in its zenith which immediately descended with astonishing precision upon the philosophic head of the instructor of youth a hollow sound and a red-hot hiss attended the contact but the theory was in the amplest manner illustrated for the unfortunate bucket perished in the conflict but the blazing countenance of professor von poddingcoft emerged from amidst the waters glowing fiercer than ever with unutterable indignation whereby the students were marvelously edified and departed considerably wiser than before it is a mortifying circumstance which greatly perplexes many a painstaking philosopher that nature often refuses to second his most profound and elaborate efforts so that often after having invented one of the most ingenious and natural theories imaginable she will have the perverseness to act directly in the teeth of his system and flatly contradict his most favorite positions this is a manifest and unmerited grievance since it throws the censure of the vulgar and unlearned entirely upon the philosopher whereas the fault is not to be ascribed to his theory which is unquestionably correct but to the waywardness of dame nature who

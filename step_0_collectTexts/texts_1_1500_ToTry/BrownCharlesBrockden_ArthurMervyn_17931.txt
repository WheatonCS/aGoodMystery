arthur mervyn chapter i i was resident in this city during the year many motives contributed to detain me though departure was easy and commodious and my friends were generally solicitous for me to go it is not my purpose to enumerate these motives or to dwell on my present concerns and transactions but merely to compose a narrative of some incidents with which my situation made me acquainted returning one evening somewhat later than usual to my own house my attention was attracted just as i entered the porch by the figure of a man reclining against the wall at a few paces distant my sight was imperfectly assisted by a far-off lamp but the posture in which he sat the hour and the place immediately suggested the idea of one disabled by sickness it was obvious to conclude that his disease was pestilential this did not deter me from approaching and examining him more closely he leaned his head against the wall his eyes were shut his hands clasped in each other and his body seemed to be sustained in an upright position merely by the cellar-door against which he rested his left shoulder the lethargy into which he was sunk seemed scarcely interrupted by my feeling his hand and his forehead his throbbing temples and burning skin indicated a fever and his form already emaciated seemed to prove that it had not been of short duration there was only one circumstance that hindered me from forming an immediate determination in what manner this person should be treated my family consisted of my wife and a young child our servant-maid had been seized three days before by the reigning malady and at her own request had been conveyed to the hospital we ourselves enjoyed good health and were hopeful of escaping with our lives our measures for this end had been cautiously taken and carefully adhered to they did not consist in avoiding the receptacles of infection for my office required me to go daily into the midst of them nor in filling the house with the exhalations of gunpowder vinegar or tar they consisted in cleanliness reasonable exercise and wholesome diet custom had likewise blunted the edge of our apprehensions to take this person into my house and bestow upon him the requisite attendance was the scheme that first occurred to me in this however the advice of my wife was to govern me i mentioned the incident to her i pointed out the danger which was to be dreaded from such an inmate i desired her to decide with caution and mentioned my resolution to conform myself implicitly to her decision should we refuse to harbour him we must not forget that there was a hospital to which he would perhaps consent to be carried and where he would be accommodated in the best manner the times would admit nay said she talk not of hospitals at least let him have his choice i have no fear about me for my part in a case where the injunctions of duty are so obvious let us take the poor unfortunate wretch into our protection and care and leave the consequences to heaven i expected and was pleased with this proposal i returned to the sick man and on rousing him from his stupor found him still in possession of his reason with a candle near i had an opportunity of viewing him more accurately his garb was plain careless and denoted rusticity his aspect was simple and ingenuous and his decayed visage still retained traces of uncommon but manlike beauty he had all the appearances of mere youth unspoiled by luxury and uninured to misfortune i scarcely ever beheld an object which laid so powerful and sudden a claim to my affection and succour you are sick said i in as cheerful a tone as i could assume cold bricks and night-airs are comfortless attendants for one in your condition rise i pray you and come into the house we will try to supply you with accommodations a little more suitable at this address he fixed his languid eyes upon me what would you have said he i am very well as i am while i breathe which will not be long i shall breathe with more freedom here than elsewhere let me alone i am very well as i am nay said i this situation is unsuitable to a sick man i only ask you to come into my house and receive all the kindness that it is in our power to bestow pluck up courage and i will answer for your recovery provided you submit to directions and do as we would have you rise and come along with me we will find you a physician and a nurse and all we ask in return is good spirits and compliance do you not know he replied what my disease is why should you risk your safety for the sake of one whom your kindness cannot benefit and who has nothing to give in return there was something in the style of this remark that heightened my prepossession in his favour and made me pursue my purpose with more zeal let us try what we can do for you i answered if we save your life we shall have done you some service and as for recompense we will look to that it was with considerable difficulty that he was persuaded to accept our invitation he was conducted to a chamber and the criticalness of his case requiring unusual attention i spent the night at his bedside my wife was encumbered with the care both of her infant and her family the charming babe was in perfect health but her mother's constitution was frail and delicate we simplified the household duties as much as possible but still these duties were considerably burdensome to one not used to the performance and luxuriously educated the addition of a sick man was likely to be productive of much fatigue my engagements would not allow me to be always at home and the state of my patient and the remedies necessary to be prescribed were attended with many noxious and disgustful circumstances my fortune would not allow me to hire assistance my wife with a feeble frame and a mind shrinking on ordinary occasions from such offices with fastidious scrupulousness was to be his only or principal nurse my neighbours were fervent in their well-meant zeal and loud in their remonstrances on the imprudence and rashness of my conduct they called me presumptuous and cruel in exposing my wife and child as well as myself to such imminent hazard for the sake of one too who most probably was worthless and whose disease had doubtless been by negligence or mistreatment rendered incurable i did not turn a deaf ear to these censurers i was aware of all the inconveniences and perils to which i thus spontaneously exposed myself no one knew better the value of that woman whom i called mine or set a higher price upon her life her health and her ease the virulence and activity of this contagion the dangerous condition of my patient and the dubiousness of his character were not forgotten by me but still my conduct in this affair received my own entire approbation all objections on the score of my friends were removed by her own willingness and even solicitude to undertake the province i had more confidence than others in the vincibility of this disease and in the success of those measures which we had used for our defence against it but whatever were the evils to accrue to us we were sure of one thing namely that the consciousness of having neglected this unfortunate person would be a source of more unhappiness than could possibly redound from the attendance and care that he would claim the more we saw of him indeed the more did we congratulate ourselves on our proceeding his torments were acute and tedious but in the midst even of delirium his heart seemed to overflow with gratitude and to be actuated by no wish but to alleviate our toil and our danger he made prodigious exertions to perform necessary offices for himself he suppressed his feelings and struggled to maintain a cheerful tone and countenance that he might prevent that anxiety which the sight of his sufferings produced in us he was perpetually furnishing reasons why his nurse should leave him alone and betrayed dissatisfaction whenever she entered his apartment in a few days there were reasons to conclude him out of danger and in a fortnight nothing but exercise and nourishment were wanting to complete his restoration meanwhile nothing was obtained from him but general information that his place of abode was chester county and that some momentous engagement induced him to hazard his safety by coming to the city in the height of the epidemic

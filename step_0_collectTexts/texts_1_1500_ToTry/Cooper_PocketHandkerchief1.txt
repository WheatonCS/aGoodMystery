autobiography of a pocket-handkerchief certain moral philosophers with a due disdain of the flimsy foundations of human pride have shown that every man is equally descended from a million of ancestors within a given number of generations thereby demonstrating that no prince exists who does not participate in the blood of some beggar or any beggar who does not share in the blood of princes although favored by a strictly vegetable descent myself the laws of nature have not permitted me to escape from the influence of this common rule the earliest accounts i possess of my progenitors represent them as a goodly growth of the linum usitatissimum divided into a thousand cotemporaneous plants singularly well conditioned and remarkable for an equality that renders the production valuable in this particular then i may be said to enjoy a precedency over the bourbons themselves who now govern no less than four different states of europe and who have sat on thrones these thousand years while our family has followed the general human law in the matter just mentioned it forms a marked exception to the rule that so absolutely controls all of white blood on this continent in what relates to immigration and territorial origin when the american enters on the history of his ancestors he is driven after some ten or twelve generations at most to seek refuge in a country in europe whereas exactly the reverse is the case with us our most remote extraction being american while our more recent construction and education have taken place in europe when i speak of the earliest accounts i possess of my progenitors authentic information is meant only for like other races we have certain dark legends that might possibly carry us back again to the old world in quest of our estates and privileges but in writing this history it has been my determination from the first to record nothing but settled truths and to reject everything in the shape of vague report or unauthenticated anecdote under these limitations i have ever considered my family as american by origin european by emigration and restored to its paternal soil by the mutations and calculations of industry and trade the glorious family of cotemporaneous plants from which i derive my being grew in a lovely vale of connecticut and quite near to the banks of the celebrated river of the same name this renders us strictly yankee in our origin an extraction of which i find all who enjoy it fond of boasting it is the only subject of self-felicitation with which i am acquainted that men can indulge in without awakening the envy of their fellow-creatures from which i infer it is at least innocent if not commendable we have traditions among us of the enjoyments of our predecessors as they rioted in the fertility of their cis-atlantic field a happy company of thriving and luxuriant plants still i shall pass them over merely remarking that a bountiful nature has made such provision for the happiness of all created things as enables each to rejoice in its existence and to praise after its fashion and kind the divine being to which it owes its creation in due time the field in which my forefathers grew was gathered the seed winnowed from the chaff and collected in casks when the whole company was shipped for ireland now occurred one of those chances which decide the fortunes of plants as well as those of men giving me a claim to norman instead of milesian descent the embarkation or shipment of my progenitors whichever may be the proper expression occurred in the height of the last general war and for a novelty it occurred in an english ship a french privateer captured the vessel on her passage home the flaxseed was condemned and sold my ancestors being transferred in a body to the ownership of a certain agriculturist in the neighborhood of evreux who dealt largely in such articles there have been evil disposed vegetables that have seen fit to reproach us with this sale as a stigma on our family history but i have ever considered it myself as a circumstance of which one has no more reason to be ashamed than a d'uzes has to blush for the robberies of a baron of the middle ages each is an incident in the progress of civilization the man and the vegetable alike taking the direction pointed out by providence for the fulfilment of his or its destiny plants have sensation as well as animals the latter however have no consciousness anterior to their physical births and very little indeed for some time afterwards whereas a different law prevails as respects us our mental conformation being such as to enable us to refer our moral existence to a period that embraces the experience reasoning and sentiments of several generations as respects logical inductions for instance the linum usitatissimum draws as largely on the intellectual acquisitions of the various epochas that belonged to the three or four parent stems which preceded it as on its own in a word that accumulated knowledge which man inherits by means of books imparted and transmitted information schools colleges and universities we obtain through more subtle agencies that are incorporated with our organic construction and which form a species of hereditary mesmerism a vegetable clairvoyance that enables us to see with the eyes hear with the ears and digest with the understandings of our predecessors some of the happiest moments of my moral existence were thus obtained while our family was growing in the fields of normandy it happened that a distinguished astronomer selected a beautiful seat that was placed on the very margin of our position as a favorite spot for his observations and discourses from a recollection of the latter of which in particular i still derive indescribable satisfaction it seems as only yesterday it is in fact fourteen long long years that i heard him thus holding forth to his pupils explaining the marvels of the illimitable void and rendering clear to my understanding the vast distance that exists between the being that created all things and the works of his hands to those who live in the narrow circle of human interests and human feelings there ever exists unheeded almost unnoticed before their very eyes the most humbling proofs of their own comparative insignificance in the scale of creation which in the midst of their admitted mastery over the earth and all it contains it would be well for them to consider if they would obtain just views of what they are and what they were intended to be i think i can still hear this learned and devout man for his soul was filled with devotion to the dread being that could hold a universe in subjection to his will dwelling with delight on all the discoveries among the heavenly bodies that the recent improvements in science and mechanics have enabled the astronomers to make fortunately he gave his discourses somewhat of the progressive character of lectures leading his listeners on as it might be step by step in a way to render all easy to the commonest understanding thus it was i first got accurate notions of the almost inconceivable magnitude of space to which indeed it is probable there are no more positive limits than there are a beginning and an end to eternity can these wonders be i thought and how pitiful in those who affect to reduce all things to the level of their own powers of comprehension and their own experience in practice let them exercise their sublime and boasted reason i said to myself in endeavoring to comprehend infinity in any thing and we will note the result if it be in space we shall find them setting bounds to their illimitable void until ashamed of the feebleness of their first effort it is renewed again and again only to furnish new proofs of the insufficiency of any of earth even to bring within the compass of their imaginations truths that all their experiments inductions evidence and revelations compel them to admit the moon has no atmosphere said our astronomer one day and if inhabited at all it must be by beings constructed altogether differently from ourselves nothing that has life either animal or vegetable as we know them can exist without air and it follows that nothing having life according to our views of it can exist in the moon or if any thing having life do exist there it must be under such modifications of all our known facts as to amount to something like other principles of being one side of that planet feels the genial warmth of the sun for a fortnight while the other is for the same period without it he continued that which feels the sun must be a day of a heat so intense as to render it insupportable to

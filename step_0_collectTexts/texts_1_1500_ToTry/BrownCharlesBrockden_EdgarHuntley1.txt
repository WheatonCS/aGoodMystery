chapter i i sit down my friend to comply with thy request at length does the impetuosity of my fears the transports of my wonder permit me to recollect my promise and perform it at length am i somewhat delivered from suspense and from tremors at length the drama is brought to an imperfect close and the series of events that absorbed my faculties that hurried away my attention has terminated in repose till now to hold a steadfast pen was impossible to disengage my senses from the scene that was passing or approaching to forbear to grasp at futurity to suffer so much thought to wander from the purpose which engrossed my fears and my hopes could not be yet am i sure that even now my perturbations are sufficiently stilled for an employment like this that the incidents i am going to relate can be recalled and arranged without indistinctness and confusion that emotions will not be reawakened by my narrative incompatible with order and coherence yet when i shall be better qualified for this task i know not time may take away these headlong energies and give me back my ancient sobriety but this change will only be effected by weakening my remembrance of these events in proportion as i gain power over words shall i lose dominion over sentiments in proportion as my tale is deliberate and slow the incidents and motives which it is designed to exhibit will be imperfectly revived and obscurely portrayed oh why art thou away at a time like this wert thou present the office to which my pen is so inadequate would easily be executed by my tongue accents can scarcely be too rapid or that which words should fail to convey my looks and gestures would suffice to communicate but i know thy coming is impossible to leave this spot is equally beyond my power to keep thee in ignorance of what has happened would justly offend thee there is no method of informing thee except by letter and this method must i therefore adopt how short is the period that has elapsed since thou and i parted and yet how full of tumult and dismay has been my soul during that period what light has burst upon my ignorance of myself and of mankind how sudden and enormous the transition from uncertainty to knowledge but let me recall my thoughts let me struggle for so much composure as will permit my pen to trace intelligible characters let me place in order the incidents that are to compose my tale i need not call on thee to listen the fate of waldegrave was as fertile of torment to thee as to me his bloody and mysterious catastrophe equally awakened thy grief thy revenge and thy curiosity thou wilt catch from my story every horror and every sympathy which it paints thou wilt shudder with my foreboding and dissolve with my tears as the sister of my friend and as one who honours me with her affection thou wilt share in all my tasks and all my dangers you need not be reminded with what reluctance i left you to reach this place by evening was impossible unless i had set out early in the morning but your society was too precious not to be enjoyed to the last moment it was indispensable to be here on tuesday but my duty required no more than that i should arrive by sunrise on that day to travel during the night was productive of no formidable inconvenience the air was likely to be frosty and sharp but these would not incommode one who walked with speed a nocturnal journey in districts so romantic and wild as these through which lay my road was more congenial to my temper than a noonday ramble by nightfall i was within ten miles of my uncle's house as the darkness increased and i advanced on my way my sensations sunk into melancholy the scene and the time reminded me of the friend whom i had lost i recalled his features and accents and gestures and mused with unutterable feelings on the circumstances of his death my recollections once more plunged me into anguish and perplexity once more i asked who was his assassin by what motives could he be impelled to a deed like this waldegrave was pure from all offence his piety was rapturous his benevolence was a stranger to remissness or torpor all who came within the sphere of his influence experienced and acknowledged his benign activity his friends were few because his habits were timid and reserved but the existence of an enemy was impossible i recalled the incidents of our last interview my importunities that he should postpone his ill-omened journey till the morning his inexplicable obstinacy his resolution to set out on foot during a dark and tempestuous night and the horrible disaster that befell him the first intimation i received of this misfortune the insanity of vengeance and grief into which i was hurried my fruitless searches for the author of this guilt my midnight wanderings and reveries beneath the shade of that fatal elm were revived and reacted i heard the discharge of the pistol i witnessed the alarm of inglefield i heard his calls to his servants and saw them issue forth with lights and hasten to the spot whence the sound had seemed to proceed i beheld my friend stretched upon the earth ghastly with a mortal wound alone with no traces of the slayer visible no tokens by which his place of refuge might be sought the motives of his enmity or his instruments of mischief might be detected i hung over the dying youth whose insensibility forbade him to recognise his friend or unfold the cause of his destruction i accompanied his remains to the grave i tended the sacred spot where he lay i once more exercised my penetration and my zeal in pursuit of his assassin once more my meditations and exertions were doomed to be disappointed i need not remind thee of what is past time and reason seemed to have dissolved the spell which made me deaf to the dictates of duty and discretion remembrances had ceased to agonize to urge me to headlong acts and foster sanguinary purposes the gloom was half dispersed and a radiance had succeeded sweeter than my former joys now by some unseen concurrence of reflections my thoughts reverted into some degree of bitterness methought that to ascertain the hand who killed my friend was not impossible and to punish the crime was just that to forbear inquiry or withhold punishment was to violate my duty to my god and to mankind the impulse was gradually awakened that bade me once more to seek the elm once more to explore the ground to scrutinize its trunk what could i expect to find had it not been a hundred times examined had i not extended my search to the neighbouring groves and precipices had i not pored upon the brooks and pried into the pits and hollows that were adjacent to the scene of blood lately i had viewed this conduct with shame and regret but in the present state of my mind it assumed the appearance of conformity with prudence and i felt myself irresistibly prompted to repeat my search some time had elapsed since my departure from this district time enough for momentous changes to occur expedients that formerly were useless might now lead instantaneously to the end which i sought the tree which had formerly been shunned by the criminal might in the absence of the avenger of blood be incautiously approached thoughtless or fearless of my return it was possible that he might at this moment be detected hovering near the scene of his offences nothing can be pleaded in extenuation of this relapse into folly my return after an absence of some duration into the scene of these transactions and sufferings the time of night the glimmering of the stars the obscurity in which external objects were wrapped and which consequently did not draw my attention from the images of fancy may in some degree account for the revival of those sentiments and resolutions which immediately succeeded the death of waldegrave and which during my visit to you had been suspended you know the situation of the elm in the midst of a private road on the verge of norwalk near the habitation of inglefield but three miles from my uncle's house it was now my intention to visit it the road in which i was travelling led a different way it was requisite to leave it therefore and make a circuit through meadows and over steeps my journey would by these means be considerably prolonged but on that head i was indifferent or rather considering how far the night had already advanced it was desirable not to reach home till the

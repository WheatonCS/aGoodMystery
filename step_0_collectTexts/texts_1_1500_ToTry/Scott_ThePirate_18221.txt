peculiar interest he has many times scribbled at the old bureau in chiefswood whereon sir walter worked at his novel and sat in summer weather beneath the great tree on the lawn where erskine used to read the fresh chapters to lockhart and his wife while the burn murmured by from the rhymer's glen so little altered is the cottage of chiefswood by the addition of a gabled wing in the same red stone as the older portion so charmed a quiet has the place in the shelter of eildon hill that there one can readily beget the golden time again and think oneself back into the day when mustard and spice running down the shady glen might herald the coming of the sheriff himself happy hours and gone like that summer of whereof lockhart speaks with an emotion the more touching because it is so rare the first of several seasons which will ever dwell on my memory as the happiest of my life we were near enough abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of its brilliant society yet could do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which the daily reception of new visitors entailed upon all the society except sir walter himself but in truth even he was not always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of open-house-keeping even his temper sank sometimes under the solemn applause of learned dulness the vapid raptures of painted and periwigged dowagers the horse-leech avidity with which underbred foreigners urged their questions and the pompous simpers of condescending magnates when sore beset in this way he would every now and then discover that he had some very particular business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate and craving the indulgence of his guests overnight appear at the cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning the clatter of sibyl grey's hoofs the yelping of mustard and spice and his own joyous shout of reveill√©e under our window were the signal that he had burst his bonds and meant for that day to take his ease in his inn after breakfast he would take possession of a dressing-room upstairs and write a chapter of the pirate and then having made up and dispatched his parcel for mr ballantyne away to join purdie where the foresters were at work the constant and eager delight with which erskine watched the progress of the tale has left a deep impression on my memory and indeed i heard so many of its chapters first read from the ms by him that i can never open the book now without thinking i hear his voice sir walter used to give him at breakfast the pages he had written that morning and very commonly while he was again at work in his study erskine would walk over to chiefswood that he might have the pleasure of reading them aloud to my wife and me under our favourite tree the tree is living yet this long quotation from a book but too little read in general may be excused for its interest as bearing on the composition of the pirate in the early autumn of in the pirate scott fell back on his recollections of the orcades as seen by him in a tour with the commissioners of light houses in august immediately after the publication of waverley they were accompanied by mr stevenson the celebrated engineer a most gentlemanlike and modest man and well known by his scientific skill it is understood that mr stevenson also kept a diary and that it is to be published by the care of his distinguished grandson mr robert louis stevenson author of kidnapped the master of ballantrae and other novels in which scott would have recognised a not alien genius sir walter's diary read in company with the pirate offers a most curious study of his art in composition it may be said that he scarcely noted a natural feature a monument a custom a superstition or a legend in zetland and orkney which he did not weave into the magic web of his romance in the diary all those matters appear as very ordinary in the pirate they are transfigured in the light of fancy history gives scott the career of gow and his betrothal to an island lady observation gives him a few headlands picts houses ruined towers and old stone monuments and his characters gather about these in rhythmic array like the dancers in the sword-dance we may conceive that cleveland like gow was originally meant to die and that minna like margaret in the ballad of clerk saunders was to recover her troth from the hand of her dead lover but if scott intended this he was good-natured and relented taking the incidents in the diary in company with the novel we find in the very first page of the pirate mention of the roost or rost of sumburgh the running current of tidal water which he hated so because it made him so sea-sick all the landsmen sicker than sick and our viceroy stevenson qualmish it is proposed to have a light on sumburgh head fitful head is higher but is to the west from which quarter few vessels come as for sumburgh head scott climbed it rolled down a rock from the summit and found it a fine situation to compose an ode to the genius of sumburgh head or an elegy upon a cormorant or to have written or spoken madness of any kind in prose or poetry but i gave vent to my excited feelings in a more simple way and sitting gently down on the steep green slope which led to the beach i e'en slid down a few hundred feet and found the exercise quite an adequate vent to my enthusiasm sir walter was certainly not what he found mrs hemans too poetical in the first chapter his giffords scotts of scotstarvet the fifeshire house not of the border clan and mouats are the very gentry who entertained him on his tour his plantie cruives in the novel had been noted in the diary lockhart iv pate stewart the oppressive earl is chronicled at length in the diary his huge tower remains wild and desolate its chambers filled with sand and its rifted walls and dismantled battlements giving unrestrained access to the roaring sea-blast so scott wrote in his last review for the quarterly a criticism of pitcairn's scotch criminal trials the trows or drows the fairy dwarfs he studied on the spot and connects the name with dwerg though trolls seem rather to be their spiritual and linguistic ancestors the affair of the clergyman who was taken for a pecht or pict actually occurred during the tour and mr stevenson who had met the poor pecht before was able to clear his character in the same place the kraken is mentioned he had been visible for nearly a fortnight but no sailor dared go near him he lay in the offing a fortnight or more but the devil a zetlander put from the shore if your grace thinks i'm writing the thing that is not you may ask at a namesake of ours mr scott sir walter wrote to the duke of buccleugh he paid a visit to an old lady who

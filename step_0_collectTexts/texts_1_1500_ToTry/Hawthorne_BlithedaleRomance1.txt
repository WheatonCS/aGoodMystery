i old moodie the evening before my departure for blithedale i was returning to my bachelor apartments after attending the wonderful exhibition of the veiled lady when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in an obscure part of the street mr coverdale said he softly can i speak with you a moment as i have casually alluded to the veiled lady it may not be amiss to mention for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with her now forgotten celebrity that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric line one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new science or the revival of an old humbug since those times her sisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice nor in fact has any one of them come before the public under such skilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at once mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady in question nowadays in the management of his subject clairvoyant or medium the exhibitor affects the simplicity and openness of scientific experiment and even if he profess to tread a step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world yet carries with him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his preternatural conquests twelve or fifteen years ago on the contrary all the arts of mysterious arrangement of picturesque disposition and artistically contrasted light and shade were made available in order to set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to ordinary facts in the case of the veiled lady moreover the interest of the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity and an absurd rumor probably set afloat by the exhibitor and at one time very prevalent that a beautiful young lady of family and fortune was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil it was white with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen like the sunny side of a cloud and falling over the wearer from head to foot was supposed to insulate her from the material world from time and space and to endow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit her pretensions however whether miraculous or otherwise have little to do with the present narrative except indeed that i had propounded for the veiled lady's prophetic solution a query as to the success of our blithedale enterprise the response by the bye was of the true sibylline stamp nonsensical in its first aspect yet on closer study unfolding a variety of interpretations one of which has certainly accorded with the event i was turning over this riddle in my mind and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail when the old man above mentioned interrupted me mr coverdale mr coverdale said he repeating my name twice in order to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he uttered it i ask your pardon sir but i hear you are going to blithedale tomorrow i knew the pale elderly face with the red-tipt nose and the patch over one eye and likewise saw something characteristic in the old fellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate only revealing enough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance he was a very shy personage this mr moodie and the trait was the more singular as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into the stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men yes mr moodie i answered wondering what interest he could take in the fact it is my intention to go to blithedale to-morrow can i be of any service to you before my departure if you pleased mr coverdale said he you might do me a very great favor a very great one repeated i in a tone that must have expressed but little alacrity of beneficence although i was ready to do the old man any amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself a very great favor do you say my time is brief mr moodie and i have a good many preparations to make but be good enough to tell me what you wish ah sir replied old moodie i don't quite like to do that and on further thoughts mr coverdale perhaps i had better apply to some older gentleman or to some lady if you would have the kindness to make me known to one who may happen to be going to blithedale you are a young man sir does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose asked i however if an older man will suit you better there is mr hollingsworth who has three or four years the advantage of me in age and is a much more solid character and a philanthropist to boot i am only a poet and so the critics tell me no great affair at that but what can this business be mr moodie it begins to interest me especially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found desirable come i am really anxious to be of service to you but the old fellow in his civil and demure manner was both freakish and obstinate and he had now taken some notion or other into his head that made him hesitate in his former design i wonder sir said he whether you know a lady whom they call zenobia not personally i answered although i expect that pleasure to-morrow as she has got the start of the rest of us and is already a resident at blithedale but have you a literary turn mr moodie or have you taken up the advocacy of women's rights or what else can have interested you in this lady zenobia by the bye as i suppose you know is merely her public name a sort of mask in which she comes before the world retaining all the privileges of privacy a contrivance in short like the white drapery of the veiled lady only a little more transparent but it is late will you tell me what i can do for you please to excuse me to-night mr coverdale said moodie you are very kind but i am afraid i have troubled you when after all there may be no need perhaps with your good leave i will come to your lodgings to-morrow morning before you set out for blithedale i wish you a good-night sir and beg pardon for stopping you and so he slipt away and as he did not show himself the next morning it was only through subsequent events that i ever arrived at a plausible conjecture as to what his business could have been arriving at my room i threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate lighted a cigar and spent an hour in musings of every hue from the brightest to the most sombre being in truth not so very confident as at some former periods that this final step which would mix me up irrevocably with the blithedale affair was the wisest that could possibly be taken it was nothing short of midnight when i went to bed after drinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which i used to pride myself in those days it was the very last bottle and i finished it with a friend the next forenoon before setting out for blithedale ii blithedale there can hardly remain for me who am really getting to be a frosty bachelor with another white hair every week or so in my mustache there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth as that which i remember the next day at blithedale it was a wood fire in the parlor of an old farmhouse on an april afternoon but with the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney vividly does that fireside re-create itself as i rake away the ashes from the embers in my memory and blow them up with a sigh for lack of more inspiring breath vividly for an instant but anon with the dimmest gleam and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my finger-ends the staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out their genial glow must be represented if at all by the merest phosphoric glimmer like that which exudes rather than shines from damp fragments of decayed trees deluding the benighted wanderer through a forest around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit on the withered leaves spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary warmth and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of paradise anew paradise indeed nobody else in the world i am bold to affirm nobody at least in our bleak little world of new england had dreamed of paradise that day except as

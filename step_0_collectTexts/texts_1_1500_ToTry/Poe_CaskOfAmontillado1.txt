 the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance to a threat at length i would be avenged this was a point definitely settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk i must not only punish but punish with impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will i continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this respect i did not differ from him materially i was skillful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably well you are looking to-day but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle of the carnival i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain amontillado i have my doubts amontillado and i must satisfy them amontillado as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a critical turn it is he he will tell me luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive you have an engagement luchesi i have no engagement come my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said i but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication nitre he asked at length nitre i replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes it is nothing he said at last come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible besides there is luchesi enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i shall not die of a cough true true i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould drink i said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled i drink he said to the buried that repose around us and i to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded these vaults he said are extensive the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family i forget your arms a huge human foot d'or in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel and the motto nemo me impune lacessit good he said the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the river's bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of the medoc i broke and reached him a flagon of de grave he emptied it at a breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movement a grotesque one you do not comprehend he said not i i replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes i said yes yes you impossible a mason a mason i replied a sign he said a sign it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their

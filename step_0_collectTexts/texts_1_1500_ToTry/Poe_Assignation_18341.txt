ill-fated and mysterious man bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination and fallen in the flames of thine own youth again in fancy i behold thee once more thy form hath risen before me not oh not as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions thine own venice which is a star-beloved elysium of the sea and the wide windows of whose palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters yes i repeat it as thou shouldst be there are surely other worlds than this other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude other speculations than the speculations of the sophist who then shall call thy conduct into question who blame thee for thy visionary hours or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life which were but the overflowings of thine everlasting energies it was at venice beneath the covered archway there called the ponte di sospiri that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom i speak it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting yet i remember ah how should i forget the deep midnight the bridge of sighs the beauty of woman and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal it was a night of unusual gloom the great clock of the piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening the square of the campanile lay silent and deserted and the lights in the old ducal palace were dying fast away i was returning home from the piazetta by way of the grand canal but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal san marco a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night in one wild hysterical and long continued shriek startled at the sound i sprang upon my feet while the gondolier letting slip his single oar lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel like some huge and sable-feathered condor we were slowly drifting down towards the bridge of sighs when a thousand flambeaux flashing from the windows and down the staircases of the ducal palace turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and preternatural day a child slipping from the arms of its own mother had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim and although my own gondola was the only one in sight many a stout swimmer already in the stream was seeking in vain upon the surface the treasure which was to be found alas only within the abyss upon the broad black marble flagstones at the entrance of the palace and a few steps above the water stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten it was the marchesa aphrodite the adoration of all venice the gayest of the gay the most lovely where all were beautiful but still the young wife of the old and intriguing mentoni and the mother of that fair child her first and only one who now deep beneath the murky water was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name she stood alone her small bare and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of marble beneath her her hair not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array clustered amid a shower of diamonds round and round her classical head in curls like those of the young hyacinth a snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form but the mid-summer and midnight air was hot sullen and still and no motion in the statue-like form itself stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the niobe yet strange to say her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried but riveted in a widely different direction the prison of the old republic is i think the stateliest building in all venice but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it when beneath her lay stifling her only child yon dark gloomy niche too yawns right opposite her chamber window what then could there be in its shadows in its architecture in its ivy-wreathed and solemn cornices that the marchesa di mentoni had not wondered at a thousand times before nonsense who does not remember that at such a time as this the eye like a shattered mirror multiplies the images of its sorrow and sees in innumerable far-off places the woe which is close at hand many steps above the marchesa and within the arch of the water-gate stood in full dress the satyr-like figure of mentoni himself he was occasionally occupied in thrumming a guitar and seemed ennuye to the very death as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his child stupified and aghast i had myself no power to move from the upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance as with pale countenance and rigid limbs i floated down among them in that funereal gondola all efforts proved in vain many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing their exertions and yielding to a gloomy sorrow there seemed but little hope for the child how much less than for the mother but now from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison and as fronting the lattice of the marchesa a figure muffled in a cloak stepped out within reach of the light and pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy descent plunged headlong into the canal as in an instant afterwards he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp upon the marble flagstones by the side of the marchesa his cloak heavy with the drenching water became unfastened and falling in folds about his feet discovered to the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very young man with the sound of whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing no word spoke the deliverer but the marchesa she will now receive her child she will press it to her heart she will cling to its little form and smother it with her caresses alas another's arms have taken it from the stranger another's arms have taken it away and borne it afar off unnoticed into the palace and the marchesa her lip her beautiful lip trembles tears are gathering in her eyes those eyes which like pliny's acanthus are soft and almost liquid yes tears are gathering in those eyes and see the entire woman thrills throughout the soul and the statue has started into life the pallor of the marble countenance the swelling of the marble bosom the very purity of the marble feet we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame as a gentle air at napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass why should that lady blush to this demand there is no answer except that having left in the eager haste and terror of a mother's heart the privacy of her own boudoir she has neglected to enthral her tiny feet in their slippers and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due what other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing for the glance of those wild appealing eyes for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand that hand which fell as mentoni turned into the palace accidentally upon the hand of the stranger what reason could there have been for the low the singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu thou hast conquered she said or the murmurs of the water deceived me thou hast conquered one hour after sunrise we shall meet so let it be the tumult had subsided the lights had died away within the palace and the stranger whom i now recognized stood alone upon the flags he shook with inconceivable agitation and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola i could not do less than offer him the service of my own and

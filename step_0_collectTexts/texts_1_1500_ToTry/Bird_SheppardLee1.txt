i have often debated in my mind whether i should give to the world or for ever lock up within the secrecy of my own breast the history of the adventures which it has been my lot in life to experience the importance of any single individual in society especially one so isolated as myself is so little that it can scarcely be supposed that the community at large can be affected by his fortunes either good or evil or interested in any way in his fate yet it sometimes happens that circumstances conspire to elevate the humblest person from obscurity and to give the whole world an interest in his affairs and that man may safely consider himself of some value in his generation whose history is of a character to instruct the ignorant and inexperienced such a man i consider myself to be and the more i reflect upon my past life the more i am convinced it contains a lesson which may be studied with profit while at the same time if i am not greatly mistaken the lesson will be found neither dry nor repulsive but here and there on the contrary quite diverting the psychologist i hate big words but one cannot do without them and the metaphysician will discover in my relation some new subjects for reflection and so perhaps will the doctor of medicine and the physiologist but while i leave these learned gentlemen to discuss what may appear most wonderful in my revealments i am most anxious that the common reader may weigh the value of what is at least in appearance more natural simple and comprehensible it will be perceived that many of the following adventures are of a truly extraordinary character there are some men and to such my story will seem incredible enough who pride themselves on believing nothing that they do not know and who endeavour very absurdly to restrict the objects of belief to those that admit of personal cognizance there are others again who boast the same maxim but have a more liberal understanding of the subjects of knowledge and permit themselves to believe many things which are susceptible of satisfactory proof but not of direct cognition now i must declare beforehand in order to avoid all trouble that from the very nature of the life i have led consisting of the strangest transitions and vicissitudes it is impossible i should have laid up proofs to satisfy any one of the truth of my relation who is disposed to be incredulous if any one should say i doubt all the answer i could make would be doubt and be hanged not however meaning any offence to anybody though it is natural one should be displeased at having his veracity questioned i write for the world at large which is neither philosophic nor skeptical and the world will believe me otherwise it is a less sensible world than i have all along supposed it to be chapter ii the birth and family of sheppard lee with some account of his temper and complexion of mind i was born somewhere towards the close of the last century but the register-leaf having been torn from the family bible and no one remaining who can give me information on the point i am not certain as to the exact year in the state of new-jersey in one of the oldest counties that border upon the delaware river my father was a farmer in very good circumstances respectable in his degree but perhaps more famous for the excellent sausages he used to manufacture for the philadelphia market than for any quality of mind or body that can distinguish one man from his fellows taking the hint from his success in this article of produce he gradually converted his whole estate into a market-farm raising fine fruits and vegetables and such other articles as are most in demand in a city in which enterprise he succeeded beyond his highest expectations and bade fair to be as in the end he became a rich man the only obstacle to a speedy accumulation of riches was a disproportionate increase in the agents of consumption his children multiplying on his hands almost as fast as his acres until he could count eleven in all a number that filled him at one time with consternation he used to declare no apple could be expected to ripen on a farm where there were eleven children and as for watermelons and sugar-corn it was folly to think of raising them longer but fate sent my father relief sooner and more effectually than he either expected or desired nine of the eleven being removed by death in a space of time short of six years three two of whom were twin sisters were translated in the natural way falling victims to an epidemic and were buried in the same grave a fourth was soon after killed by falling out of an apple-tree my eldest brother then a boy of fourteen years old upon some freak ran away from home for he was of a wild madcap turn and getting into an oyster-boat made a voyage into the bay where he was lost for having fallen overboard and not being able to swim a clumsy fellow who thought to save him in that way clutched him round the neck with a pair of oyster-tongs and thereby strangled him two others were drowned in a millpond where they were scraping for snapping-turtles another who was the wag of the family was killed by attempting to ride a pig which running in great alarm through a broken fence into the orchard dashed his brains out against a white-oak rail and the ninth died of a sort of hysterical affection caused by this unlucky exploit of his brother for he could not cease laughing at it notwithstanding its melancholy termination and he died of the fit within twenty-four hours thus in a few years there remained but two of all the eleven children to wit my oldest sister prudence and myself my mother from whom i had my christian name sheppard that being her maiden name died several years before this last catastrophe her mind having been affected and indeed distracted by so many mournful losses occurring in such rapid succession she fell into a deep melancholy and died insane being one of the youngest children i grieved but little for the loss of my brothers and sisters nor was i able to appreciate the advantage which in a worldly point of view their death must prove to me my father however perceived the difference for having now so few to look after and be chargeable to him he could with great propriety consider himself a rich man he immediately resolved as i was now his only son that i should have a good education and it was not his fault if in this particular i fell short of his expectations i was sent to good schools and in course of time was removed to the college at nassau hall in princeton where i remained during three years that is until my father's decease when i yielded to the natural indolence of my temper and left the college or rather for i had formed no resolution on the subject procrastinated my return from day to day until it was too late to return my natural disposition was placid and easy i believe i may say sluggish i was not wanting in parts but had as little energy or activity of mind as ever fell to the share of a jerseyman and how my father ever came to believe i should make a figure in the world i cannot conceive unless it was because he knew he had a fortune to leave me and saw me safely lodged in a college it is very certain he encouraged a strong belief that i should one day be a great man and i fancy it was for this reason he showed himself so favourable to me in his will he left me the bulk of his property bestowing upon my sister who had recently married little beyond a farm which he had purchased in a neighbouring county but which was a valuable one and quite satisfied her husband but my father was a better judge of sausages than of human character besides being deficient as i humbly confess in all those qualities that are necessary to the formation of a great man i had not the slightest desire to be one ambition was a passion that never afflicted my mind and i was so indifferent to the game of greatness which was playing around me that i seriously declare there was a president of the united states elected to office and turned out again after having served his regular term without my knowing any thing about it i had not even the desire so common to

the ashes here murder'd kings beneath my footsteps sleep and yonder lies the scene death where mary jeirn'd to weep captain marjoribaxks every quarter edinburgh has its own peculiar boast so that the city together combines within its precincts if you take the word the inhabitants on the subject as much variety as beauty as much historical interest as natural sublimity our claims in behalf the canongate are not the slightest or least interesting the castle may excel us in extent prospect and natural sublimity site the canton had always the superiority its unrivalled panorama and has late added to them that its towers bridges and triumphal arches the high street we acknowledge had the distinguished honour being defended by fortifications which we can show no vestiges we will not descend to notice the claims mere upstart districts called old new town and new new town not to mention the favourite moray place which is the newest new town all we will not match ourselves except with our equals and with our equals in age only for indignity we admit none we boast being the court the town possessing the palace and the sepulchral remains ancient monarchs and that we have the power to excite in a degree unknown to the less honoured quarters the city the dark and solemn recollections the ancient grandeur which occupied the precincts our venerable abbey from the time st david till her deserted halls were once more made glad and her long silent echoes awakened by the visit our present gracious sovereign my long habitation in the neighbourhood and the quiet respectability my habits have given me a sort intimacy with good mrs the housekeeper in that most interesting part the old building called queen mary's apartments but a circumstance which lately happened has conferred upon me greater privileges so that indeed i might i believe venture on the exploit chaplet who was executed for being found secreted at midnight in the very bedchamber scotland's mistress it chanced that the good lady i have mentioned was in the discharge her function showing the apartments to a cockney from london not one your quiet dull commonplace visitors who gape yawn and listen with an acquiescent humph to the information doled out by the provincial cicerone no such thing this was the brisk alert agent a great house in the city who missed no opportunity doing business as he termed it that is putting off the goods his hemp oyer and improving his own account commission he had fidgeted through the suite apartments without finding the least opportunity to touch upon that which he considered as the principal his existence even the story rizzio's assassination presented no ideas to this emissary commerce until the housekeeper appealed in support her narrative to the dusky stains blood upon the floor these are the stains she said nothing will remove them from the place there they have been for two hundred and fifty years and there they will remain while the floor is left standing neither water nor anything else will ever remove them from that spot now our cockney amongst other articles sold scouring drops as they are called and a stain two hundred and fifty years standing was interesting to him not because it had been caused by the blood a queen's favourite slain in her apartment but because it offered so admirable an opportunity to prove the efficacy his unequalled detergent elixir down on his knees went our friend but neither in horror nor devotion two hundred and fifty years ma'am and nothing take it away why if it had been five hundred i have something in my pocket will fetch it out in five minutes d'ye see this elixir ma'am i will show you the stain vanish in a moment accordingly whetting one his handkerchief with the alldeterging specific he began to rub away on the planks without heeding the remonstrances mrs she good soul stood at first in astonishment like the abbess st bridget's when a profane visitant drank up the vial brandy which had long passed muster among the relics the cloister for the tears the blessed saint the venerable guardian st bridget probably expected the interference her patroness she holy rood might perhaps hope that david rizzio's spectre would arise to prevent the profanation but mrs stood not long in the silence horror she uplifted her voice and screamed as loudly as queen mary herself when the dreadful deed was in the act perpetration harrow now out and walawa she cried i happened to be taking my morning walk in the adjoining gallery pondering in my mind why the kings scotland who hung around me should be each and every one painted with a nose like the knocker a door when lo the walls once more reechoed with such shrieks as formerly were as often heard in the scottish palaces as were sounds revelry and music somewhat surprised at such an alarm in a place so solitary i hastened to the spot and found the wellmeaning traveller scrubbing the floor like a housemaid while mrs dragging him by the skirts the coat in vain endeavoured to divert him from his sacrilegious purpose it cost me some trouble to explain to the zealous purifier silkstockings embroidered waistcoats broadcloth and deal planks that there were such things in the world as stains which ought to remain indelible on account the associations with which they are connected our good friend viewed everything oi the kind only as the means displaying the virtue his vaunted commodity he comprehended however that he would not be permitted to proceed to exemplify its powers on the present occasion so took his leave muttering that he had always heard the scots were a nasty people but had no idea they carried it sofar as to choose to have the floors their palaces bloodaltered like banquo's ghost when to remove them would have cost but a hundred drops the infallible detergent elixir prepared and sold by messrs scrub and rub in five shilling and ten shilling bottles each bottle being marked with the initials the inventor to counterfeit which would be to incur the pains forgery freed from the odious presence this lover cleanliness my good friend mrs was profuse in her expressions thanks and yet her gratitude instead exhausting itself in these declarations according to the way the world continues as lively at this moment as if she had never thanked me at all it is owing to her recollection this piece good service that i have the permission wandering like the ghost some departed gentlemanusher through these deserted halls sometimes as the old irish ditty expresses it thinking on things that are long enough ago and sometimes wishing i could with the good luck most editors romantic narrative light upon some hidden crypt or massive antique cabinet which should yield to my researches an almost illegible manuscript containing the authentic particulars some the strange deeds those wild days the unhappy mary my dear mrs baliol used to sympathize with me when i regretted that all the godsend this nature had ceased to occur and that an author might chatter his teeth to pieces by the seaside without a wave ever wafting to him a casket containing such a history as that automatic that he might break his shins in stumbling through a hundred vaults without finding anything but rats and mice and become the tenant a dozen sets shabby tenements without seeing any manuscript but the weekly bill for board and lodging a dairymaid these degenerate days might as well wash and deck her dairy in hopes finding the fairy tester in her shoe it is a sad and too true a tale cousin said mrs baliol i am sure we all have occasion to regret the want these ready supplements to a failing invention but you most all have right to complain that the fairies have not favoured your researches you who have shown the world that the age chivalry still exists you the knight croftangry who braved the fury the london prentice bold in behalf the fair dame and the memorial rizzio's slaughter is it not a pity cousin considering the feat chivalry was otherwise so much according to rule is it not i say a great pity that the lady had not been a little younger and the legend a little older why as to the age at which a fair dame loses the benefits chivalry and is no longer entitled o crave boon brave knight that i u leave to the statutes the order errantry but for the blood rizzio i take up the gauntlet and maintain against all and sundry that i hold the stains to be no modern date but to have been actually the consequence and the record that terrible

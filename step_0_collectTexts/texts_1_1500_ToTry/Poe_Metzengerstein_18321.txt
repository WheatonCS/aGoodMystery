horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages why then give a date to this story i have to tell let it suffice to say that at the period of which i speak there existed in the interior of hungary a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the metempsychosis of the doctrines themselves that is of their falsity or of their probability i say nothing i assert however that much of our incredulity as la bruyère says of all our unhappiness vient de ne pouvoir être seuls but there are some points in the hungarian superstition which were fast verging to absurdity they the hungarians differed very essentially from their eastern authorities for example the soul said the former i give the words of an acute and intelligent parisian ne demeure qu'un seul fois dans un corps sensible au reste un cheval un chien un homme même n'est que la ressemblance peu tangible de ces animaux the families of berlifitzing and metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries never before were two houses so illustrious mutually embittered by hostility so deadly the origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy a lofty name shall have a fearful fall when as the rider over his horse the mortality of metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of berlifitzing to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning but more trivial causes have given rise and that no long while ago to consequences equally eventful besides the estates which were contiguous had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government moreover near neighbors are seldom friends and the inhabitants of the castle berlifitzing might look from their lofty buttresses into the very windows of the palace metzengerstein least of all had the more than feudal magnificence thus discovered a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy berlifitzings what wonder then that the words however silly of that prediction should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already predisposed to quarrel by every instigation of hereditary jealousy the prophecy seemed to imply if it implied anything a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential wilhelm count berlifitzing although loftily descended was at the epoch of this narrative an infirm and doting old man remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival and so passionate a love of horses and of hunting that neither bodily infirmity great age nor mental incapacity prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the chase frederick baron metzengerstein was on the other hand not yet of age his father the minister g died young his mother the lady mary followed him quickly after frederick was at that time in his fifteenth year in a city fifteen years are no long period a child may be still a child in his third lustrum but in a wilderness in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality fifteen years have a far deeper meaning from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father the young baron at the decease of the former entered immediately upon his vast possessions such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of hungary his castles were without number the chief in point of splendor and extent was the château metzengerstein the boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles upon the succession of a proprietor so young with a character so well known to a fortune so unparalleled little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct and indeed for the space of three days the behavior of the heir out-heroded herod and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers shameful debaucheries flagrant treacheries unheard-of atrocities gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part no punctilios of conscience on his own were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula on the night of the fourth day the stables of the castle berlifitzing were discovered to be on fire and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the baron's misdemeanors and enormities but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of metzengerstein the rich although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors here rich-ermined priests and pontifical dignitaries familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign put a veto on the wishes of a temporal king or restrained with the fiat of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the arch-enemy there the dark tall statures of the princes metzengerstein their muscular war-coursers plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes startled the steadiest nerves with their vigorous expression and here again the voluptuous and swan-like figures of the dames of days gone by floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary melody but as the baron listened or affected to listen to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of berlifitzing or perhaps pondered upon some more novel some more decided act of audacity his eyes became unwittingly rivetted to the figure of an enormous and unnaturally colored horse represented in the tapestry as belonging to a saracen ancestor of the family of his rival the horse itself in the foreground of the design stood motionless and statue-like while farther back its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein on frederick's lip arose a fiendish expression as he became aware of the direction which his glance had without his consciousness assumed yet he did not remove it on the contrary he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses it was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake the longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry but the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment the action however was but momentary his gaze returned mechanically to the wall to his extreme horror and astonishment the head of the gigantic steed had in the meantime altered its position the neck of the animal before arched as if in compassion over the prostrate body of its lord was now extended at full length in the direction of the baron the eyes before invisible now wore an energetic and human expression while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth stupified with terror the young nobleman tottered to the door as he threw it open a flash of red light streaming far into the chamber flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry and he shuddered to perceive that shadow as he staggered awhile upon the threshold assuming the exact position and precisely filling up the contour of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the saracen berlifitzing to lighten the depression of his spirits the baron hurried into the open air at the principal gate of the palace he encountered three equerries with much difficulty and at the imminent peril of their lives they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and fiery-colored horse whose horse where did you get him demanded the youth in a querulous and husky tone of voice as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the tapestried chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes he is your own property sire replied one of the equerries at least he is claimed by no other owner we caught him flying all smoking and foaming with rage from the burning stables of the castle berlifitzing supposing him to have belonged to the old count's stud of foreign horses we led him back as an estray but the grooms there disclaim any title to the creature which is strange since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames the letters w v b are also branded very distinctly on his forehead interrupted a second equerry i supposed them of course to be the initials of wilhelm von berlifitzing but all at the castle are positive

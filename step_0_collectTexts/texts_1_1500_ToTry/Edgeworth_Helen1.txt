the overwrought state helens feelings was relieved by a walk with beauclerc not in the dressed part the park but in what was generally undiscovered country a dingle a bosky dell which he had found out in his rambles and which though so little distant from the busy hum men had a wonderful air romantic seclusion and stillness the stillness evening it was a fine evening though it was in the very autumn the sun had not set its rich red light yet lingered on the still remaining autumn tints upon the trees the birds hopped fearlessly from bough to bough as if this sweet spot were all their own the cattle were quietly grazing blow or slowly winding their way to the wateringplace by degrees the sounds evening faded away upon the ear a faint chirrup here and there from the few birds not yet gone to roost and now only the humming the flies over the water were to be heard it was perfect repose and beauclerc and helen sat down on the bank to enjoy it together the sympathy the woman he loved especially in his enjoyment the beauties nature was to beauclerc an absolute necessary life nor would he have been contented with that show taste for the picturesque which is as he knew merely one a modern young lady's many accomplishments helenass taste was natural and he was glad to feel it so true and for him here alone expressed with such peculiar heightened feeling as if she had in all nature now a new sense delight he had brought her here in hopes that she would be struck with this spot not only because it was beautiful in itself and his discovery but because it was like another bushy dell and bosky bourne which he had been from childhood fond in another place which he hoped she would soon be mistress soon i helen very soon helen he repeated in a tone which could not be heard by her with indifference he said that some his friends in london told him that the report their intended union had been spread everywhere by lady katrine hawksbyby probably as cecilia when lady castlefort departed had confided to her to settle her mind about beauclerc that he was coming over as miss stanley's acknowledged lover and since the report had been so spread the sooner the marriage took place the better at least it was a plea which beauclerc failed not to urge and helen's delicacy failed not to feel she sighed she smiled the day was named and the moment she consented to be his nothing could be thought but him yet even while he poured out all his soul while he enjoyed the satisfaction there is in perfect unreservedness confidence helen felt a pang mix with her pleasure she felt there was one thing she could not tell him he who had told her everything all his faults and follies oh why thought she why helens cannot i tell him everything i who have no secrets my own why should i be forced to keep the secrets another in confusion scarcely finished these ideas came across her mind and she sighed deeply beauclerc asked why and she could not tell him she was silent and he did not reiterate the indiscreet question he was sure she thought lady davenant and he now spoke the regret he felt that she could not be present at their marriage and lord davenant too beauclerc said he had hoped that lord davenant who loved helen as if she were his own daughter would have been the person to act as her father at the ceremony but the general his friend and her's would now beauclerc said give her to him and would he was sure take pleasure in thus publicly marking his approbation his ward's choice they rose and going on down the path to the rivers side they reached a little cove where he had moored his boat and they returned home by water the moon just visible the air so still all so placid so delightful helen and beauclerc so happy that she could not but be happy yes quite happy too they reached the shore just as the lamps were lighting in the house as they went in they met the general who said in good time and he smiled on helen as she passed it is all settled whispered beauclerc to him and you are to give her away with pleasure said the general as helen went upstairs she said to herself i understand the general's smile he thinks i have followed his advice he thinks i have told all and i i can only be silent there was a great dinnerparty but the general not thinking cecilia quite equal to it had engaged mrs holdernesse a relation his own to do the honours the day lady cecilia came into the drawingroom in the evening but after paying her compliments to the company she gladly followed the general's advice and retired to the musicroom helen went with her and beauclerc followed lady cecilia sat down to play at ecarte with him and helen tuned her harp the general came in for a few minutes he helen said to escape from two young ladies who had half talked him dead about craniology he stood leaning on the mantelpiece and looking over the game lady cecilia wanted counters and she begged beauclerc to look for some which she believed he would find in the drawer a table that was behind him beauclerc opened the drawer but no sooner had he done so than in admiration something he discovered there he exclaimed beautiful beautiful and how like it was the miniature helen and besides the miniature further back in the drawer lady cecilia saw how quick is the eye guilty fear could it be yes one the fatal letters the letter nothing but the picture had yet been seen by the general or by beauclerc lady cecilia stretched behind her husband whose eyes were upon the miniature and closed the drawer it was all she could do it was impossible for her to reach the letter beauclerc holding the picture to the light helen repeated beautiful who did it whom is it for general look do you know it yes to be sure replied the general miss stanley you have seen it before yes said the general coldly it is very like who did it i did it cried lady cecilia who now recovered her voice you my dear lady cecilia whom for for me is it for me for you it may be hereafter perhaps oh thank you my dear lady cecilia cried beauclerc if you behave well perhaps added she the general heard in his wife's tremulous tone and saw in her half confusion half attempt at playfulness only an amiable anxiety to save her friend and to give her time to recover from her dismay he at once perceived that helen had not followed the course he had suggested that she had not told beauclerc and did not intend that he should be told the whole truth the general looked helen extremely grave beauclerc gave a glance round the room here is some mystery said he now first seeing helen's disconcerted countenance then he turned on the general a look eager inquiry some mystery certainly said he with which i am not to be made acquainted if there be any mystery said the general with which you are not to be made acquainted i am neither the adviser nor abettor neither in jest nor earnest am i ever an adviser mystery while her husband thus spoke lady cecilia made another attempt to possess herself the letter this time she rose decidedly and putting aside the little ecarte table which was in her way pressed forward to the drawer saying something about counters her cashmere caught on helen's harp and in her eager spring forward it would have been overset but that the general felt turned and caught it what are you about my dear cecilia what do you want helen nothing nothing thank you my dear nothing now then she did not dare to open the drawer or to let him open it and anxiously drew away his attention by pointing to a footstool which she seemed to want gould not you ask me for it my dear without disturbing yourself what are men made for p beauclerc after a sort absent effort to join in quest the footstool had returned eagerly to the picture and looking at it more closely he saw the letters c d written in small characters in one comer and just as his eye turned to the other corner lady cecilia recollecting what initials were there started up and snatched it from his hand oh granville l cried she you must not look at this picture any more till i

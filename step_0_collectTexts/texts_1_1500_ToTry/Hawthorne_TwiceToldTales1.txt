the gray champion there was once a time when new england groaned under the actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the revolution james ii the bigoted successor of charles the voluptuous had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion the administration of sir edmund andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny a governor and council holding office from the king and wholly independent of the country laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives the rights of private citizens violated and the titles of all landed property declared void the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press and finally disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil for two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother-country whether its head chanced to be a parliament protector or popish monarch till these evil times however such allegiance had been merely nominal and the colonists had ruled themselves enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of great britain at length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of orange had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of new england it was but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail and in either case the man that stirred against king james would lose his head still the intelligence produced a marked effect the people smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their oppressors while far and wide there was a subdued and silent agitation as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency aware of their danger the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures one afternoon in april sir edmund andros and his favorite councillors being warm with wine assembled the red-coats of the governor's guard and made their appearance in the streets of boston the sun was near setting when the march commenced the roll of the drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as the martial music of the soldiers than as a muster-call to the inhabitants themselves a multitude by various avenues assembled in king street which was destined to be the scene nearly a century afterward of another encounter between the troops of britain and a people struggling against her tyranny though more than sixty years had elapsed since the pilgrims came this crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions there was the sober garb the general severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural forms of speech and the confidence in heaven's blessing on a righteous cause which would have marked a band of the original puritans when threatened by some peril of the wilderness indeed it was not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct since there were men in the street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a house was reared to the god for whom they had become exiles old soldiers of the parliament were here too smiling grimly at the thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the house of stuart here also were the veterans of king philip's war who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them with prayer several ministers were scattered among the crowd which unlike all other mobs regarded them with such reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments these holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment was almost the universal subject of inquiry and variously explained satan will strike his master-stroke presently cried some because he knoweth that his time is short all our godly pastors are to be dragged to prison we shall see them at a smithfield fire in king street hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their minister who looked calmly upward and assumed a more apostolic dignity as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his profession a crown of martyrdom it was actually fancied at that period that new england might have a john rogers of her own to take the place of that worthy in the primer the pope of rome has given orders for a new st bartholomew cried others we are to be massacred man and male-child neither was this rumor wholly discredited although the wiser class believed the governor's object somewhat less atrocious his predecessor under the old charter bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settlers was known to be in town there were grounds for conjecturing that sir edmund andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of their chief stand firm for the old charter-governor shouted the crowd seizing upon the idea the good old governor bradstreet while this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the well-known figure of governor bradstreet himself a patriarch of nearly ninety who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted authorities my children concluded this venerable person do nothing rashly cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of new england and expect patiently what the lord will do in this matter the event was soon to be decided all this time the roll of the drum had been approaching through cornhill louder and deeper till with reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial footsteps it burst into the street a double rank of soldiers made their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of fires in the dusk their steady march was like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way next moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being sir edmund andros elderly but erect and soldier-like those around him were his favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of new england at his right hand rode edward randolph our arch-enemy that blasted wretch as cotton mather calls him who achieved the downfall of our ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse-through life and to his grave on the other side was bullivant scattering jests and mockery as he rode along dudley came behind with a downcast look dreading as well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people who beheld him their only countryman by birth among the oppressors of his native land the captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officers under the crown were also there but the figure which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling was the episcopal clergyman of king's chapel riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representative of prelacy and persecution the union of church and state and all those abominations which had driven the puritans to the wilderness another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear the whole scene was a picture of the condition of new england and its moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic rulers with the high churchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the universal groan and the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience could be secured o lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people this ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a herald's cry to introduce a remarkable personage the crowd had rolled back and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length

the piazza with fairest flowers whilst summer lasts and i live here fidele when i removed into the country it was to occupy an old-fashioned farm-house which had no piazza a deficiency the more regretted because not only did i like piazzas as somehow combining the coziness of in-doors with the freedom of out-doors and it is so pleasant to inspect your thermometer there but the country round about was such a picture that in berry time no boy climbs hill or crosses vale without coming upon easels planted in every nook and sun-burnt painters painting there a very paradise of painters the circle of the stars cut by the circle of the mountains at least so looks it from the house though once upon the mountains no circle of them can you see had the site been chosen five rods off this charmed ring would not have been the house is old seventy years since from the heart of the hearth stone hills they quarried the kaaba or holy stone to which each thanksgiving the social pilgrims used to come so long ago that in digging for the foundation the workmen used both spade and axe fighting the troglodytes of those subterranean parts sturdy roots of a sturdy wood encamped upon what is now a long land-slide of sleeping meadow sloping away off from my poppy-bed of that knit wood but one survivor stands an elm lonely through steadfastness whoever built the house he builded better than he knew or else orion in the zenith flashed down his damocles sword to him some starry night and said build there for how otherwise could it have entered the builder's mind that upon the clearing being made such a purple prospect would be his nothing less than greylock with all his hills about him like charlemagne among his peers now for a house so situated in such a country to have no piazza for the convenience of those who might desire to feast upon the view and take their time and ease about it seemed as much of an omission as if a picture-gallery should have no bench for what but picture-galleries are the marble halls of these same limestone hills galleries hung month after month anew with pictures ever fading into pictures ever fresh and beauty is like piety you cannot run and read it tranquillity and constancy with now-a-days an easy chair are needed for though of old when reverence was in vogue and indolence was not the devotees of nature doubtless used to stand and adore just as in the cathedrals of those ages the worshipers of a higher power did yet in these times of failing faith and feeble knees we have the piazza and the pew during the first year of my residence the more leisurely to witness the coronation of charlemagne weather permitting they crown him every sunrise and sunset i chose me on the hill-side bank near by a royal lounge of turf a green velvet lounge with long moss-padded back while at the head strangely enough there grew but i suppose for heraldry three tufts of blue violets in a field-argent of wild strawberries and a trellis with honeysuckle i set for canopy very majestical lounge indeed so much so that here as with the reclining majesty of denmark in his orchard a sly ear-ache invaded me but if damps abound at times in westminster abbey because it is so old why not within this monastery of mountains which is older a piazza must be had the house was wide my fortune narrow so that to build a panoramic piazza one round and round it could not be although indeed considering the matter by rule and square the carpenters in the kindest way were anxious to gratify my furthest wishes at i've forgotten how much a foot upon but one of the four sides would prudence grant me what i wanted now which side to the east that long camp of the hearth stone hills fading far away towards quito and every fall a small white flake of something peering suddenly of a coolish morning from the topmost cliff the season's new-dropped lamb its earliest fleece and then the christmas dawn draping those dim highlands with red-barred plaids and tartans goodly sight from your piazza that goodly sight but to the north is charlemagne can't have the hearth stone hills with charlemagne well the south side apple-trees are there pleasant of a balmy morning in the month of may to sit and see that orchard white-budded as for a bridal and in october one green arsenal yard such piles of ruddy shot very fine i grant but to the north is charlemagne the west side look an upland pasture alleying away into a maple wood at top sweet in opening spring to trace upon the hill-side otherwise gray and bare to trace i say the oldest paths by their streaks of earliest green sweet indeed i can't deny but to the north is charlemagne so charlemagne he carried it it was not long after and somehow about that time all round the world these kings they had the casting vote and voted for themselves no sooner was ground broken than all the neighborhood neighbor dives in particular broke too into a laugh piazza to the north winter piazza wants of winter midnights to watch the aurora borealis i suppose hope he's laid in good store of polar muffs and mittens that was in the lion month of march not forgotten are the blue noses of the carpenters and how they scouted at the greenness of the cit who would build his sole piazza to the north but march don't last forever patience and august comes and then in the cool elysium of my northern bower i lazarus in abraham's bosom cast down the hill a pitying glance on poor old dives tormented in the purgatory of his piazza to the south but even in december this northern piazza does not repel nipping cold and gusty though it be and the north wind like any miller bolting by the snow in finest flour for then once more with frosted beard i pace the sleety deck weathering cape horn in summer too canute-like sitting here one is often reminded of the sea for not only do long ground-swells roll the slanting grain and little wavelets of the grass ripple over upon the low piazza as their beach and the blown down of dandelions is wafted like the spray and the purple of the mountains is just the purple of the billows and a still august noon broods upon the deep meadows as a calm upon the line but the vastness and the lonesomeness are so oceanic and the silence and the sameness too that the first peep of a strange house rising beyond the trees is for all the world like spying on the barbary coast an unknown sail and this recalls my inland voyage to fairy-land a true voyage but take it all in all interesting as if invented from the piazza some uncertain object i had caught mysteriously snugged away to all appearance in a sort of purpled breast-pocket high up in a hopper-like hollow or sunken angle among the northwestern mountains yet whether really it was on a mountain-side or a mountain-top could not be determined because though viewed from favorable points a blue summit peering up away behind the rest will as it were talk to you over their heads and plainly tell you that though he the blue summit seems among them he is not of them god forbid and indeed would have you know that he considers himself as to say truth he has good right by several cubits their superior nevertheless certain ranges here and there double-filed as in platoons so shoulder and follow up upon one another with their irregular shapes and heights that from the piazza a nigher and lower mountain will in most states of the atmosphere effacingly shade itself away into a higher and further one that an object bleak on the former's crest will for all that appear nested in the latter's flank these mountains somehow they play at hide-and-seek and all before one's eyes but be that as it may the spot in question was at all events so situated as to be only visible and then but vaguely under certain witching conditions of light and shadow indeed for a year or more i knew not there was such a spot and might perhaps have never known had it not been for a wizard afternoon in autumn late in autumn a mad poet's afternoon when the turned maple woods in the broad basin below me having lost their first vermilion tint dully smoked like smouldering towns when flames expire upon their prey and rumor had it that this smokiness in the general air was not all indian summer which was not used

three memorable murders a sequel to murder considered as one of the fine arts it is impossible to conciliate readers of so saturnine and gloomy a class that they cannot enter with genial sympathy into any gaiety whatever but least of all when the gaiety trespasses a little into the province of the extravagant in such a case not to sympathize is not to understand and the playfulness which is not relished becomes flat and insipid or absolutely without meaning fortunately after all such churls have withdrawn from my audience in high displeasure there remains a large majority who are loud in acknowledging the amusement which they have derived from a former paper of mine on murder considered as one of the fine arts at the same time proving the sincerity of their praise by one hesitating expression of censure repeatedly they have suggested to me that perhaps the extravagance though clearly intentional and forming one element in the general gaiety of the conception went too far i am not myself of that opinion and i beg to remind these friendly censors that it is amongst the direct purposes and efforts of this bagatelle to graze the brink of horror and of all that would in actual realization be most repulsive the very excess of the extravagance in fact by suggesting to the reader continually the mere aeriality of the entire speculation furnishes the surest means of disenchanting him from the horror which might else gather upon his feelings let me remind such objectors once for all of dean swift's proposal for turning to account the supernumerary infants of the three kingdoms which in those days both at dublin and at london were provided for in foundling hospitals by cooking and eating them this was an extravaganza though really bolder and more coarsely practical than mine which did not provoke any reproaches even to a dignitary of the supreme irish church its own monstrosity was its excuse mere extravagance was felt to license and accredit the little jeu d'esprit precisely as the blank impossibilities of lilliput of laputa of the yahoos c had licensed those if therefore any man thinks it worth his while to tilt against so mere a foam-bubble of gaiety as this lecture on the aesthetics of murder i shelter myself for the moment under the telamonian shield of the dean but in reality my own little paper may plead a privileged excuse for its extravagance such as is altogether wanting to the dean's nobody can pretend for a moment on behalf of the dean that there is any ordinary and natural tendency in human thoughts which could ever turn to infants as articles of diet under any conceivable circumstances this would be felt as the most aggravated form of cannibalism cannibalism applying itself to the most defenceless part of the species but on the other hand the tendency to a critical or aesthetic valuation of fires and murders is universal if you are summoned to the spectacle of a great fire undoubtedly the first impulse is to assist in putting it out but that field of exertion is very limited and is soon filled by regular professional people trained and equipped for the service in the case of a fire which is operating upon private property pity for a neighbor's calamity checks us at first in treating the affair as a scenic spectacle but perhaps the fire may be confined to public buildings and in any case after we have paid our tribute of regret to the affair considered as a calamity inevitably and without restraint we go on to consider it as a stage spectacle exclamations of how grand how magnificent arise in a sort of rapture from the crowd for instance when drury lane was burned down in the first decennium of this century the falling in of the roof was signalized by a mimic suicide of the protecting apollo that surmounted and crested the centre of this roof the god was stationary with his lyre and seemed looking down upon the fiery ruins that were so rapidly approaching him suddenly the supporting timbers below him gave way a convulsive heave of the billowing flames seemed for a moment to raise the statue and then as if on some impulse of despair the presiding deity appeared not to fall but to throw himself into the fiery deluge for he went down head foremost and in all respects the descent had the air of a voluntary act what followed from every one of the bridges over the river and from other open areas which commanded the spectacle there arose a sustained uproar of admiration and sympathy some few years before this event a prodigious fire occurred at liverpool the goree a vast pile of warehouses close to one of the docks was burned to the ground the huge edifice eight or nine stories high and laden with most combustible goods many thousand bales of cotton wheat and oats in thousands of quarters tar turpentine rum gunpowder c continued through many hours of darkness to feed this tremendous fire to aggravate the calamity it blew a regular gale of wind luckily for the shipping it blew inland that is to the east and all the way down to warrington eighteen miles distant to the eastward the whole air was illuminated by flakes of cotton often saturated with rum and by what seemed absolute worlds of blazing sparks that lighted up all the upper chambers of the air all the cattle lying abroad in the fields through a breadth of eighteen miles were thrown into terror and agitation men of course read in this hurrying overhead of scintillating and blazing vortices the annunciation of some gigantic calamity going on in liverpool and the lamentation on that account was universal but that mood of public sympathy did not at all interfere to suppress or even to check the momentary bursts of rapturous admiration as this arrowy sleet of many-colored fire rode on the wings of hurricane alternately through open depths of air or through dark clouds overhead precisely the same treatment is applied to murders after the first tribute of sorrow to those who have perished but at all events after the personal interests have been tranquillized by time inevitably the scenical features what aesthetically may be called the comparative advantages of the several murders are reviewed and valued one murder is compared with another and the circumstances of superiority as for example in the incidence and effects of surprise of mystery c are collated and appraised i therefore for my extravagance claim an inevitable and perpetual ground in the spontaneous tendencies of the human mind when left to itself but no one will pretend that any corresponding plea can be advanced on behalf of swift in this important distinction between myself and the dean lies one reason which prompted the present writing a second purpose of this paper is to make the reader acquainted circumstantially with three memorable cases of murder which long ago the voice of amateurs has crowned with laurel but especially with the two earliest of the three viz the immortal williams murders of the act and the actor are each separately in the highest degree interesting and as forty-two years have elapsed since it cannot be supposed that either is known circumstantially to the men of the current generation never throughout the annals of universal christendom has there indeed been any act of one solitary insulated individual armed with power so appalling over the hearts of men as that exterminating murder by which during the winter of john williams in one hour smote two houses with emptiness exterminated all but two entire households and asserted his own supremacy above all the children of cain it would be absolutely impossible adequately to describe the frenzy of feelings which throughout the next fortnight mastered the popular heart the mere delirium of indignant horror in some the mere delirium of panic in others for twelve succeeding days under some groundless notion that the unknown murderer had quitted london the panic which had convulsed the mighty metropolis diffused itself all over the island i was myself at that time nearly three hundred miles from london but there and everywhere the panic was indescribable one lady my next neighbor whom personally i knew living at the moment during the absence of her husband with a few servants in a very solitary house never rested until she had placed eighteen doors so she told me and indeed satisfied me by ocular proof each secured by ponderous bolts and bars and chains between her own bedroom and any intruder of human build to reach her even in her drawing-room was like going as a flag of truce into a beleaguered fortress at every sixth step one was stopped by a sort of portcullis the panic was not confined to the rich women in the humblest ranks more than once died

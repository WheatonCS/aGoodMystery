starlight of the illimitable heavens above wander in silence over the trackless yet blooming wilderness left to their own thoughts they seem to see spectral forms rising from the shadows and hear voices from the other world in every unusual sound among their superstitions there is one which has often struck me with its singular interest and beauty mss of a texan come brother it is a beautiful viewlook yonder the boy advanced from the shadow of the oak and gazed upon the prairie bathed in the light of the setting sun he was but a boy slender and girlish in form and yet he grasped a rifle in his hand and carried a knife in his belt his brother did not seem to heed him but stood leaning against the trunk of the oak his arms folded over his rifle while his downcast eyes were fixed upon the sod the sun in its last glow cast a warm light over his broad chest and muscular form and invested with a golden flush his fine aquiline features shaded by a dark beard and flowing black hair it was altogether a striking face the eyes somewhat sunken beneath the welldefined brows were large black and strangely brilliant he would have been observed and gazed at in any company and even now as he stood beside the oak the boundless prairie around and the great god above there was something noble in his look and bearing it is true he wore a plaid grey frock reaching to the knee and edged with fur yet this unpretending garment displayed a broad chest supported by a waist at once slender and pliable and revealed the iron outline of his sinewy arms its color pale grey gave a richer lustre to the sunset glow which bathed his face on the sod before him lay his hat a rude thing of grey felt with skullcrown and wide slouching brim it was decorated with a single black feather come brother john look is it not a beautiful view our men the volunteers of prairie eden encamped on the prairie near this knoll their horses grazing on the rich grass as gathered in a circle their rifles near them they build the campfire and prepare for their evening meal look at the sky johnnot one cloud yes one a little cloud hovering like a bird in the west just over the setting sun and turning blue purple and gold as the light grows brighter ere it fades the prairie johnthe grass moving like waves at sea with all kinds of beautiful flowers starting from the sod come dont stand muttering there come i say and the slender boy laid his hand upon his brothers arm and playfully sought to raise his head the brother still absorbed in his thoughts did not heed him here we are thirty miles from san antonio shall we go forwardshall we return home homepshaw did not we leave prairie eden this morningwe we echoed the older brother raising his eyes and surveying the girlish form before him yes we the voluntears of prairie eden composed of mr jacob grywins two sons forty white laborerssome civilized people from the states others german emigrants and ten black slaves not to mention ewen mcgregor who now comes up the knoll to speak with captain john grywin john raised his eyes surveyed for a moment the smoke of the camp fire in the prairie not one hundred yards from where he stood and then his gaze rested upon the new comer you will observe that the knoll on which the brothers stood was one of those delicious green islands which dot the rolling surface of the wild texan prairie and are seen by the wayfarer sometimes at the distance of thirty miles it was crowned by a solitary tree a greak oak whose trunk three men could not have spanned with their extended arms broad and wide above the brothers head stretched out the rugged branches clad in a glorious drapery of silvery moss which floated like a shining shroud among the deep green leaves captain john while the boys take their supper ive come up here to have a little talk with you it was a harsh grating voice the figure was that of a giant so towering in stature so massive in the bulllike chest and formidable long arms whose corded sinews were impressed upon the folds of the grey sleeves the face was like the form huge and burly a red visage with white eyebrows and eyelashes short stiff red hair and an immense red beard matted like the mane of some wild animal it was not the most prepossessing form in the world nor the prettiest face yet an air of bluff hearty frankness seemed to pervade each featureeven the mouth with thick lips and the large eyes with yellowish ballsand govern the movement of every limb as ewen mcgregor drew near the oak well ewen or rather lieutenant mcgregor said john you see when we left prairie eden this morning bound for san antonio in obedience to a proclamation of the president of texas which summoned all good citizens to the western frontier menaced as it is by a fresh mexican invasionwhen we left i say there was some things which we did know and some things which we ought to know but did not know by well ewen said john calmly surveying the bluff form hefore him while harry looked on with a sort of comical wonder dilating his clear blue eyes we are going to san antonio resumed ewen resting his rifle on the sod for days there has been a rumor of the approach of the mexican general who commands at presidio del rio grande how do we know that at this very moment this general don bascus is not in possession of san antonio if we dont know we can easily ascertain a ride of thirty miles after dark will bring us to san antonio before midnight this cool respone seemed to disconcert the bluff ewen but capt john suppose the town should be occupied by some thousand mexican devils that would make us equal fifty white men of texas are equivalent to one thousand mexicans any day that computation is in some degree unfair for it gives one texan and his good rifle for twenty mexicans you see ewen general bascus and his thousand men must not stand in the way of fifty volunteers from prairie eden not mentioning the ten niggers laughed harry as he mischievously pulled red ewen by the heard well fling the darkies in and not make any charge for them was it a flush of anger that crossed ewens face he was silent for a moment and then in a voice and with a manner which indicated a man of some education he resumed let us dismiss all jesting on the subject john general bascus whose approach is indicated by a rumor that grows more like truth every hour has not merely a thousand men but ten thousand incarnate devils with him suppose you go on to san antonio to night and fall into his clutches just think of it johnyou and your brother and all your laborors and slaves dragged away to rot in a mexican prison while your father and isabel await your return at prairie eden this picture touched john with great force harrys smile died away and tears filled his blue eyes o john ewen speaks the truth what would become of father and isabel in case we were taken prisoners yes i see it now i was wrong this morning to leave them so utterly unprotected at prairie eden to be sure our home is isolated their is not much danger from the indians and as for the neighbors the nearest is ten miles from prairie

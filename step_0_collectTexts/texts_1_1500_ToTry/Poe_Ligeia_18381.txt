and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature of its intentness man doth not yield himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will joseph glanvill i cannot for my soul remember how when or even precisely where i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia long years have since elapsed and my memory is feeble through much suffering or perhaps i cannot now bring these points to mind because in truth the character of my beloved her rare learning her singular yet placid cast of beauty and the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown yet i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large old decaying city near the rhine of her family i have surely heard her speak that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted ligeia ligeia in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world it is by that sweet word alone by ligeia that i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more and now while i write a recollection flashes upon me that i have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed and who became the partner of my studies and finally the wife of my bosom was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia or was it a test of my strength of affection that i should institute no inquiries upon this point or was it rather a caprice of my own a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion i but indistinctly recall the fact itself what wonder that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it and indeed if ever she the wan and the misty-winged ashtophet of idolatrous egypt presided as they tell over marriages ill-omened then most surely she presided over mine there is one dear topic however on which my memory falls me not it is the person of ligeia in stature she was tall somewhat slender and in her latter days even emaciated i would in vain attempt to portray the majesty the quiet ease of her demeanor or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall she came and departed as a shadow i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her it was the radiance of an opium-dream an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen there is no exquisite beauty says bacon lord verulam speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty without some strangeness in the proportion yet although i saw that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity although i perceived that her loveliness was indeed exquisite and felt that there was much of strangeness pervading it yet i have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of the strange i examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead it was faultless how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine the skin rivalling the purest ivory the commanding extent and repose the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples and then the raven-black the glossy the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses setting forth the full force of the homeric epithet hyacinthine i looked at the delicate outlines of the nose and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit i regarded the sweet mouth here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly the magnificent turn of the short upper lip the soft voluptuous slumber of the under the dimples which sported and the color which spoke the teeth glancing back with a brilliancy almost startling every ray of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all smiles i scrutinized the formation of the chin and here too i found the gentleness of breadth the softness and the majesty the fullness and the spirituality of the greek the contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream to cleomenes the son of the athenian and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique it might have been too that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord verulam alludes they were i must believe far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race they were even fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley of nourjahad yet it was only at intervals in moments of intense excitement that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia and at such moments was her beauty in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth the beauty of the fabulous houri of the turk the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black and far over them hung jetty lashes of great length the brows slightly irregular in outline had the same tint the strangeness however which i found in the eyes was of a nature distinct from the formation or the color or the brilliancy of the features and must after all be referred to the expression ah word of no meaning behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of the spiritual the expression of the eyes of ligeia how for long hours have i pondered upon it how have i through the whole of a midsummer night struggled to fathom it what was it that something more profound than the well of democritus which lay far within the pupils of my beloved what was it i was possessed with a passion to discover those eyes those large those shining those divine orbs they became to me twin stars of leda and i to them devoutest of astrologers there is no point among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind more thrillingly exciting than the fact never i believe noticed in the schools that in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to remember and thus how frequently in my intense scrutiny of ligeia's eyes have i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression felt it approaching yet not quite be mine and so at length entirely depart and strange oh strangest mystery of all i found in the commonest objects of the universe a circle of analogies to that expression i mean to say that subsequently to the period when ligeia's beauty passed into my spirit there dwelling as in a shrine i derived from many existences in the material world a sentiment such as i felt always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs yet not the more could i define that sentiment or analyze or even steadily view it i recognized it let me repeat sometimes in the survey of a rapidly-growing vine in the contemplation of a moth a butterfly a chrysalis a stream of running water i have felt it in the ocean in the falling of a meteor i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people and there are one or two stars in heaven one especially a star of the sixth magnitude double and changeable to be found near the large star in lyra in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the feeling i have been filled with it by certain sounds from stringed instruments and not unfrequently by passages from books among innumerable other instances i well remember something in a volume of joseph glanvill which perhaps merely from its quaintness who shall say never failed to inspire me with the sentiment and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is but a great will pervading all things by nature

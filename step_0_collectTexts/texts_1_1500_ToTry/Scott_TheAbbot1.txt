i admit that my retrenchments have been numerous and leave gaps in the story which in your original manuscript would have run well nigh to a fourth volume as my printer assures me i am sensible besides that in consequence the liberty curtailment you have allowed m e some parts the story have been huddled up without the necessary details but after all it is better that the travellers should have to step over a drain than to wade through a morass that the reader should have to suppose what may easily be inferred than be obliged to creep through pages dull explanation i have struck out for example the whole machinery the white lady and the poetry by which it is so ably supported in the original manuscript but you must allow that the public taste gives little encouragement to those legendary superstitions which formed the delight alternately and the terror our predecessors in like manner much is omitted illustrative the impulse enthusiasm in favour introductory epistle ill the ancient religion in mother magdalen and the abbot but we do not feel deep sympathy at this period with what was once the most powerful and animating principle in europe with the exception that the reformation by which it was successfully opposed you rightly observe that these retrenchments have rendered the title no longer applicable to the subject and that some other would have been more suitable to the work in its present state than that the abbot who made so much greater figure in the original and for whom your friend the benedictine seems to have inspired you with a sympathetic respect i must plead guilty to this accusation observing at the same time in manner extenuation that though the objection might have been easily removed by giving a new title to the work yet in doing so i should have destroyed the necessary cohesion between the present history and its predecessor the ivio mastery which i was unwilling to do as introductory epistle the period and several the personages were the same after all my good friend it is little consequence what the work is called or on what interest it tmns providing it catches the public attention for the quality the wine could

regard them a change motives as well as actions nearly twice that space had glided away over the head halbert glendinning and his lady betwixt the conclusion that narrative in which they played a distinguished part and the commencement the present two circumstances only had embittered their union which was otherwise as happy as mutual affection could render it the first these was indeed the common calamity scotland being the distracted state that unhappy country where every man's sword was directed against his neighbour's bosom glendinning had proved what murray expected him a steady friend strong in battle and wise in counsel adhering to him from motives gratitude in situations where by his own unblessed will he would either have stood neuter or have joined the opposite party hence when danger was near and it was seldom far distant sir halbert glendinning for he now bore the rank knighthood was perpetually sumthe abbot money to attend his patron on distant expeditions or on perilous enterprizes or to assist him with his counsel in the doubtful intrigues a half barbarous court he was thus frequently and for a long space absent from his castle and from his lady and to this ground regret we must add that their union had produced no children to occupy the attention the lady while she was thus deprived her husband's domestic society on such occasions she lived almost entirely secluded from the world within the walls her paternal mansion visiting amongst neighbours was a matter entirely out the question unless on occasion solemn festival and then it was chiefly confined to near kindred these the lady avenel had none who survived and the dames the neighbouring barons affected to regard her less as the heiress the house avenel than as the wife a peasant the son a churchvassal raised the abbot up to mushroom eminence by the capricious favour murray this pride ancestry which rankled in the bosom the more ancient gentry was more openly expressed by their ladies and was moreover embittered not a little by the political feuds the time for most the southron chiefs were friends to the authority the queen and very jealous the power murray the castle was therefore on all these accounts as melancholy and solitary a residence for its lady as could well be imagined still it had the essential recommendation great security the reader knows that the fortress was built upon an islet in a small lake and was only accessible by a causeway intersected by a double ditch defended by two drawbridges so that without artillery it might in these days be considered as impregnable it was only necessary therefore to secure against surprise and the service six able men within the casthe abbot tie was sufficient for that purpose if more serious danger threatened an ample garrison was supplied by the male inhabitants a little hamlet which under the auspices halbert glendinning had arisen on a small piece level ground betwixt the lake and the hill nearly adjoining to the spot where the causeway joined the mainland the lord avenel had found it an easy matter to get inhabitants as he was not only a kind and beneficent overlord but well qualified both by his experience in armes his high character for wisdom and integrity and his favour with the powerful earl murray to protect and defend those who dwelt under his banner in leaving his castle for any length time he had therefore the consolation to reflect that this village afforded on the slightest notice a band thirty stout men which was more than sufficient for its defence while the families the villagers as was usual on such occasions fled to the recesses the mountains drove their cattle to the the abbot same places shelter and left the enemy to work their will on their miserable cottages one guest only resided generally if not constantly at the castle avenel this was henry warden who now felt himself less able to the stormy task imposed on the reforming clergy and having by his zeal given personal offence to many the leading nobles and chiefs did not consider himself as perfectly safe unless when within the walls the strong mansion some assured friend he ceased not however to serve his cause as eagerly with his pen ashe had formerly done with his tongue and had engaged in a furious and acrimonious contest concerning the sacrifice the mass as it was termed

precious in the eyes bibliographers but the engrossing nature his occupation rendered the theologian not the most interesting companion for a solitary female and his grave stern and absorbed deportment which seldom shewed any interest except in that which concerned his religious profession made his presence rather add to than diminish the gloom which hung over the castle avenel to superintend the tasks her numerous female domestics was the principal part the lady's daily employment her spindle and distaff her bible and a solitary walk upon the battlements the castle or upon the causeway or occasionally but more seldom upon the banks the little lake consumed the rest th day but so great was the insecurity the period that when she ventured a the abbot to extend her walk beyond

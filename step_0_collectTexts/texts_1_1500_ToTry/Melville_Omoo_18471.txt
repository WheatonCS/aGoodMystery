part i chapter i my reception aboard it was the middle of a bright tropical afternoon that we made good our escape from the bay the vessel we sought lay with her main-topsail aback about a league from the land and was the only object that broke the broad expanse of the ocean on approaching she turned out to be a small slatternly-looking craft her hull and spars a dingy black rigging all slack and bleached nearly white and everything denoting an ill state of affairs aboard the four boats hanging from her sides proclaimed her a whaler leaning carelessly over the bulwarks were the sailors wild haggard-looking fellows in scotch caps and faded blue frocks some of them with cheeks of a mottled bronze to which sickness soon changes the rich berry-brown of a seaman's complexion in the tropics on the quarter-deck was one whom i took for the chief mate he wore a broad-brimmed panama hat and his spy-glass was levelled as we advanced when we came alongside a low cry ran fore and aft the deck and everybody gazed at us with inquiring eyes and well they might to say nothing of the savage boat's crew panting with excitement all gesture and vociferation my own appearance was calculated to excite curiosity a robe of the native cloth was thrown over my shoulders my hair and beard were uncut and i betrayed other evidences of my recent adventure immediately on gaining the deck they beset me on all sides with questions the half of which i could not answer so incessantly were they put as an instance of the curious coincidences which often befall the sailor i must here mention that two countenances before me were familiar one was that of an old man-of-war's-man whose acquaintance i had made in rio de janeiro at which place touched the ship in which i sailed from home the other was a young man whom four years previous i had frequently met in a sailor boarding-house in liverpool i remembered parting with him at prince's dock gates in the midst of a swarm of police-officers trackmen stevedores beggars and the like and here we were again years had rolled by many a league of ocean had been traversed and we were thrown together under circumstances which almost made me doubt my own existence but a few moments passed ere i was sent for into the cabin by the captain he was quite a young man pale and slender more like a sickly counting-house clerk than a bluff sea-captain bidding me be seated he ordered the steward to hand me a glass of pisco in the state i was this stimulus almost made me delirious so that of all i then went on to relate concerning my residence on the island i can scarcely remember a word after this i was asked whether i desired to ship of course i said yes that is if he would allow me to enter for one cruise engaging to discharge me if i so desired at the next port in this way men are frequently shipped on board whalemen in the south seas my stipulation was acceded to and the ship's articles handed me to sign the mate was now called below and charged to make a well man of me not let it be borne in mind that the captain felt any great compassion for me he only desired to have the benefit of my services as soon as possible helping me on deck the mate stretched me out on the windlass and commenced examining my limb and then doctoring it after a fashion with something from the medicine-chest rolled it up in a piece of an old sail making so big a bundle that with my feet resting on the windlass i might have been taken for a sailor with the gout while this was going on someone removing my tappa cloak slipped on a blue frock in its place and another actuated by the same desire to make a civilized mortal of me flourished about my head a great pair lie imminent jeopardy of both ears and the certain destruction of hair and beard the day was now drawing to a close and as the land faded from my sight i was all alive to the change in my condition but how far short of our expectations is oftentimes the fulfilment of the most ardent hopes safe aboard of a ship so long my earnest prayer with home and friends once more in prospect i nevertheless felt weighed down by a melancholy that could not be shaken off it was the thought of never more seeing those who notwithstanding their desire to retain me a captive had upon the whole treated me so kindly i was leaving them for ever so unforeseen and sudden had been my escape so excited had i been through it all and so great the contrast between the luxurious repose of the valley and the wild noise and motion of a ship at sea that at times my recent adventures had all the strangeness of a dream and i could scarcely believe that the same sun now setting over a waste of waters had that very morning risen above the mountains and peered in upon me as i lay on my mat in typee going below into the forecastle just after dark i was inducted into a wretched bunk or sleeping-box built over another the rickety bottoms of both were spread with several pieces of a blanket a battered tin can was then handed me containing about half a pint of tea so called by courtesy though whether the juice of such stalks as one finds floating therein deserves that title is a matter all shipowners must settle with their consciences a cube of salt beef on a hard round biscuit by way of platter was also handed up and without more ado i made a meal the salt flavour of which after the nebuchadnezzar fare of the valley was positively delicious while thus engaged an old sailor on a chest just under me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke my supper finished he brushed the stem of his sooty pipe against the sleeve of his frock and politely waved it toward me the attention was sailor-like as for the nicety of the thing no man who has lived in forecastles is at all fastidious and so after a few vigorous whiffs to induce repose i turned over and tried my best to forget myself but in vain my crib instead of extending fore and aft as it should have done was placed athwart ships that is at right angles to the keel and the vessel going before the wind rolled to such a degree that-every time my heels went up and my head went down i thought i was on the point of turning a somerset beside this there were still more annoying causes of inquietude and every once in a while a splash of water came down the open scuttle and flung the spray in my face at last after a sleepless night broken twice by the merciless call of the watch a peep of daylight struggled into view from above and someone came below it was my old friend with the pipe here shipmate said i help me out of this place and let me go on deck halloa who's that croaking was the rejoinder as he peered into the obscurity where i lay ay typee my king of the cannibals is it you i but i say my lad how's that spar of your'n the mate says it's in a devil of a way and last night set the steward to sharpening the handsaw hope he won't have the carving of ye long before daylight we arrived off the bay of nukuheva and making short tacks until morning we then ran in and sent a boat ashore with the natives who had brought me to the ship upon its return we made sail again and stood off from the land there was a fine breeze and notwithstanding my bad night's rest the cool fresh air of a morning at sea was so bracing mat as soon as i breathed it my spirits rose at once seated upon the windlass the greater portion of the day and chatting freely with the men i learned the history of the voyage thus far and everything respecting the ship and its present condition these matters i will now throw together in the next chapter chapter ii some account of the ship first and foremost i must give some account of the julia herself or little jule as the sailors familiarly styled her she was a small barque of a beautiful model something more than two hundred tons yankee-built and very old fitted for a privateer out of a new england port during the war of she

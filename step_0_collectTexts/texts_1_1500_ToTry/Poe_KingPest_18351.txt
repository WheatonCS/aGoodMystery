about twelve o'clock one night in the month of october and during the chivalrous reign of the third edward two seamen belonging to the crew of the free and easy a trading schooner plying between sluys and the thames and then at anchor in that river were much astonished to find themselves seated in the tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of st andrews london which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a jolly tar the room although ill-contrived smoke-blackened low-pitched and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the period was nevertheless in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it sufficiently well adapted to its purpose of these groups our two seamen formed i think the most interesting if not the most conspicuous the one who appeared to be the elder and whom his companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of legs was at the same time much the taller of the two he might have measured six feet and a half and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous superfluities in height were however more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects he was exceedingly thin and might as his associates asserted have answered when drunk for a pennant at the mast-head or when sober have served for a jib-boom but these jests and others of a similar nature had evidently produced at no time any effect upon the cachinnatory muscles of the tar with high cheek-bones a large hawk-nose retreating chin fallen under-jaw and huge protruding white eyes the expression of his countenance although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or description the younger seaman was in all outward appearance the converse of his companion his stature could not have exceeded four feet a pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat unwieldy figure while his unusually short and thick arms with no ordinary fists at their extremities swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a sea-turtle small eyes of no particular color twinkled far back in his head his nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round full and purple face and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent self-satisfaction much heightened by the owner's habit of licking them at intervals he evidently regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous half-quizzical and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of ben nevis various and eventful however had been the peregrinations of the worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night funds even the most ample are not always everlasting and it was with empty pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie at the precise period then when this history properly commences legs and his fellow hugh tarpaulin sat each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the floor and with a hand upon either cheek they were eyeing from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for humming-stuff the portentous words no chalk which to their indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose presence they purported to deny not that the gift of decyphering written characters a gift among the commonalty of that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of inditing could in strict justice have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the sea but there was to say the truth a certain twist in the formation of the letters an indescribable lee-lurch about the whole -which foreboded in the opinion of both seamen a long run of dirty weather and determined them at once in the allegorical words of legs himself to pump ship clew up all sail and scud before the wind having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale and looped up the points of their short doublets they finally made a bolt for the street although tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place mistaking it for the door yet their escape was at length happily effected and half after twelve o'clock found our heroes ripe for mischief and running for life down a dark alley in the direction of st andrew's stair hotly pursued by the landlady of the jolly tar at the epoch of this eventful tale and periodically for many years before and after all england but more especially the metropolis resounded with the fearful cry of plague the city was in a great measure depopulated and in those horrible regions in the vicinity of the thames where amid the dark narrow and filthy lanes and alleys the demon of disease was supposed to have had his nativity awe terror and superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban and all persons forbidden under pain of death to intrude upon their dismal solitude yet neither the mandate of the monarch nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets nor the prospect of that loathsome death which with almost absolute certainty overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could deter from the adventure prevented the unfurnished and untenanted dwellings from being stripped by the hand of nightly rapine of every article such as iron brass or lead-work which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account above all it was usually found upon the annual winter opening of the barriers that locks bolts and secret cellars had proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and liquors which in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust during the period of exile to so insufficient a security but there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed these doings to the agency of human hands pest-spirits plague-goblins and fever-demons were the popular imps of mischief and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was at length enveloped in terror as in a shroud and the plunderer himself was often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had created leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom silence pestilence and death it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned and which indicated the region beyond to be under the pest-ban that in scrambling down an alley legs and the worthy hugh tarpaulin found their progress suddenly impeded to return was out of the question and no time was to be lost as their pursuers were close upon their heels with thorough-bred seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle and maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure and holding on their drunken course with shouts and yellings were soon bewildered in its noisome and intricate recesses had they not indeed been intoxicated beyond moral sense their reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their situation the air was cold and misty the paving-stones loosened from their beds lay in wild disorder amid the tall rank grass which sprang up around the feet and ankles fallen houses choked up the streets the most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailed and by the aid of that ghastly light which even at midnight never fails to emanate from a vapory and pestilential at atmosphere might be discerned lying in the by-paths and alleys or rotting in the windowless habitations the carcass of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague in the very perpetration of his robbery but it lay not in the power of images or sensations or impediments such as these to stay the course of men who naturally brave and at that time especially brimful of courage and of humming-stuff would have reeled as straight as their condition might have permitted undauntedly into the very jaws of death onward still onward stalked the grim legs making the desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the indian and onward still onward rolled the dumpy tarpaulin hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion and far surpassing the latter's most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music by bull-roarings in basso from the profundity of his stentorian lungs they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more horrible the paths more narrow and more intricate huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them gave evidence by their sullen and

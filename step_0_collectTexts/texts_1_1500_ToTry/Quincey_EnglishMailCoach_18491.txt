section i the glory of motion some twenty or more years before i matriculated at oxford mr palmer at that time mp for bath had accomplished two things very hard to do on our little planet the earth however cheap they may be held by eccentric people in comets he had invented mail-coaches and he had married the daughter of a duke he was therefore just twice as great a man as galileo who did certainly invent or which is the same thing footnote the same thing thus in the calendar of the church festivals the discovery of the true cross by helen the mother of constantine is recorded and one might think with the express consciousness of sarcasm as the invention of the cross discover the satellites of jupiter those very next things extant to mail-coaches in the two capital pretensions of speed and keeping time but on the other hand who did not marry the daughter of a duke these mail-coaches as organised by mr palmer are entitled to a circumstantial notice from myself having had so large a share in developing the anarchies of my subsequent dreams an agency which they accomplished st through velocity at that time unprecedented for they first revealed the glory of motion dly through grand effects for the eye between lamplight and the darkness upon solitary roads dly through animal beauty and power so often displayed in the class of horses selected for this mail service thly through the conscious presence of a central intellect that in the midst of vast distances footnote vast distances one case was familiar to mail-coach travellers where two mails in opposite directions north and south starting at the same minute from points six hundred miles apart met almost constantly at a particular bridge which bisected the total distance of storms of darkness of danger overruled all obstacles into one steady co-operation to a national result for my own feeling this post-office service spoke as by some mighty orchestra where a thousand instruments all disregarding each other and so far in danger of discord yet all obedient as slaves to the supreme baton of some great leader terminate in a perfection of harmony like that of heart brain and lungs in a healthy animal organisation but finally that particular element in this whole combination which most impressed myself and through which it is that to this hour mr palmer's mail-coach system tyrannises over my dreams by terror and terrific beauty lay in the awful political mission which at that time it fulfilled the mail-coach it was that distributed over the face of the land like the opening of apocalyptic vials the heart-shaking news of trafalgar of salamanca of vittoria of waterloo these were the harvests that in the grandeur of their reaping redeemed the tears and blood in which they had been sown neither was the meanest peasant so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the times as to confound battles such as these which were gradually moulding the destinies of christendom with the vulgar conflicts of ordinary warfare so often no more than gladiatorial trials of national prowess the victories of england in this stupendous contest rose of themselves as natural te deums to heaven and it was felt by the thoughtful that such victories at such a crisis of general prostration were not more beneficial to ourselves than finally to france our enemy and to the nations of all western or central europe through whose pusillanimity it was that the french domination had prospered the mail-coach as the national organ for publishing these mighty events thus diffusively influential became itself a spiritualised and glorified object to an impassioned heart and naturally in the oxford of that day all hearts were impassioned as being all or nearly all in early manhood in most universities there is one single college in oxford there were five-and-twenty all of which were peopled by young men the élite of their own generation not boys but men none under eighteen in some of these many colleges the custom permitted the student to keep what are called short terms that is the four terms of michaelmas lent easter and act were kept by a residence in the aggregate of ninety-one days or thirteen weeks under this interrupted residence it was possible that a student might have a reason for going down to his home four times in the year this made eight journeys to and fro but as these homes lay dispersed through all the shires of the island and most of us disdained all coaches except his majesty's mail no city out of london could pretend to so extensive a connexion with mr palmer's establishment as oxford three mails at the least i remember as passing every day through oxford and benefiting by my personal patronage viz the worcester the gloucester and the holyhead mail naturally therefore it became a point of some interest with us whose journeys revolved every six weeks on an average to look a little into the executive details of the system with some of these mr palmer had no concern they rested upon bye-laws enacted by posting-houses for their own benefit and upon other bye-laws equally stern enacted by the inside passengers for the illustration of their own haughty exclusiveness these last were of a nature to rouse our scorn from which the transition was not very long to systematic mutiny up to this time say or the year of trafalgar it had been the fixed assumption of the four inside people as an old tradition of all public carriages derived from the reign of charles ii that they the illustrious quaternion constituted a porcelain variety of the human race whose dignity would have been compromised by exchanging one word of civility with the three miserable delf-ware outsides even to have kicked an outsider might have been held to attaint the foot concerned in that operation so that perhaps it would have required an act of parliament to restore its purity of blood what words then could express the horror and the sense of treason in that case which had happened where all three outsides the trinity of pariahs made a vain attempt to sit down at the same breakfast-table or dinner-table with the consecrated four i myself witnessed such an attempt and on that occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavoured to soothe his three holy associates by suggesting that if the outsides were indicted for this criminal attempt at the next assizes the court would regard it as a case of lunacy or delirium tremens rather than of treason england owes much of her grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in her social composition when pulling against her strong democracy i am not the man to laugh at it but sometimes undoubtedly it expressed itself in comic shapes the course taken with the infatuated outsiders in the particular attempt which i have noticed was that the waiter beckoning them away from the privileged salle-à-manger sang out this way my good men and then enticed these good men away to the kitchen but that plan had not always answered sometimes though rarely cases occurred where the intruders being stronger than usual or more vicious than usual resolutely refused to budge and so far carried their point as to have a separate table arranged for themselves in a corner of the general room yet if an indian screen could be found ample enough to plant them out from the very eyes of the high table or dais it then became possible to assume as a fiction of law that the three delf fellows after all were not present they could be ignored by the porcelain men under the maxim that objects not appearing and objects not existing are governed by the same logical construction footnote de non apparentibus etc such being at that time the usage of mail-coaches what was to be done by us of young oxford we the most aristocratic of people who were addicted to the practice of looking down superciliously even upon the insides themselves as often very questionable characters were we by voluntarily going outside to court indignities if our dress and bearing sheltered us generally from the suspicion of being raff the name at that period for snobs footnote snobs and its antithesis nobs arose among the internal factions of shoemakers perhaps ten years later possibly enough the terms may have existed much earlier but they were then first made known picturesquely and effectively by a trial at some assizes which happened to fix the public attention we really were such constructively by the place we assumed if we did not submit to the deep shadow of eclipse we entered at least the skirts of its penumbra and the analogy of theatres was valid against us where no man can complain of the annoyances incident to the pit or gallery having his instant remedy in paying the

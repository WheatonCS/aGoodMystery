the sketch book the author's account of himself i am of this mind with homer that as the snaile that crept out of her shel was turned eftsoones into a toad i and thereby was forced to make a stoole to sit on so the traveller that stragleth from his owne country is in a short time transformed into so monstrous a shape that he is faine to alter his mansion with his manners and to live where he can not where he would lyly's euphues i was always fond of visiting new scenes and observing strange characters and manners even when a mere child i began my travels and made many tours of discovery into foreign parts and unknown regions of my native city to the frequent alarm of my parents and the emolument of the town crier as i grew into boyhood i extended the range of my observations my holiday afternoons were spent in rambles about the surrounding country i made myself familiar with all its places famous in history or fable i knew every spot where a murder or robbery had been committed or a ghost seen i visited the neighboring villages and added greatly to my stock of knowledge by noting their habits and customs and conversing with their sages and great men i even journeyed one long summer's day to the summit of the most distant hill whence i stretched my eye over many a mile of terra incognita and was astonished to find how vast a globe i inhabited this rambling propensity strengthened with my years books of voyages and travels became my passion and in devouring their contents i neglected the regular exercises of the school how wistfully would i wander about the pier-heads in fine weather and watch the parting ships bound to distant climes with what longing eyes would i gaze after their lessening sails and waft myself in imagination to the ends of the earth further reading and thinking though they brought this vague inclination into more reasonable bounds only served to make it more decided i visited various parts of my own country and had i been merely a lover of fine scenery i should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere its gratification for on no country had the charms of nature been more prodigally lavished her mighty lakes her oceans of liquid silver her mountains with their bright aerial tints her valleys teeming with wild fertility her tremendous cataracts thundering in their solitudes her boundless plains waving with spontaneous verdure her broad deep rivers rolling in solemn silence to the ocean her trackless forests where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence her skies kindling with the magic of summer clouds and glorious sunshine no never need an american look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural scenery but europe held forth all the charms of storied and poetical association there were to be seen the masterpieces of art the refinements of highly cultivated society the quaint peculiarities of ancient and local custom my native country was full of youthful promise europe was rich in the accumulated treasures of age her very ruins told the history of the times gone by and every mouldering stone was a chronicle i longed to wander over the scenes of renowned achievement to tread as it were in the footsteps of antiquity to loiter about the ruined castle to meditate on the falling tower to escape in short from the commonplace realities of the present and lose myself among the shadowy grandeurs of the past i had besides all this an earnest desire to see the great men of the earth we have it is true our great men in america not a city but has an ample share of them i have mingled among them in my time and been almost withered by the shade into which they cast me for there is nothing so baleful to a small man as the shade of a great one particularly the great man of a city but i was anxious to see the great men of europe for i had read in the works of various philosophers that all animals degenerated in america and man among the number a great man of europe thought i must therefore be as superior to a great man of america as a peak of the alps to a highland of the hudson and in this idea i was confirmed by observing the comparative importance and swelling magnitude of many english travellers among us who i was assured were very little people in their own country i will visit this land of wonders thought i and see the gigantic race from which i am degenerated it has been either my good or evil lot to have my roving passion gratified i have wandered through different countries and witnessed many of the shifting scenes of life i cannot say that i have studied them with the eye of a philosopher but rather with the sauntering gaze with which humble lovers of the picturesque stroll from the window of one print-shop to another caught sometimes by the delineations of beauty sometimes by the distortions of caricature and sometimes by the loveliness of landscape as it is the fashion for modern tourists to travel pencil in hand and bring home their portfolios filled with sketches i am disposed to get up a few for the entertainment of my friends when however i look over the hints and memorandums i have taken down for the purpose my heart almost fails me at finding how my idle humor has led me astray from the great object studied by every regular traveller who would make a book i fear i shall give equal disappointment with an unlucky landscape-painter who had travelled on the continent but following the bent of his vagrant inclination had sketched in nooks and corners and by-places his sketch-book was accordingly crowded with cottages and landscapes and obscure ruins but he had neglected to paint st peter's or the coliseum the cascade of terni or the bay of naples and had not a single glacier or volcano in his whole collection the voyage ships ships i will descrie you amidst the main i will come and try you what you are protecting and projecting what's your end and aim one goes abroad for merchandise and trading another stays to keep his country from invading a third is coming home with rich and wealthy lading hallo my fancie whither wilt thou go old poem to an american visiting europe the long voyage he has to make is an excellent preparative the temporary absence of worldly scenes and employments produces a state of mind peculiarly fitted to receive new and vivid impressions the vast space of waters that separate the hemispheres is like a blank page in existence there is no gradual transition by which as in europe the features and population of one country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another from the moment you lose sight of the land you have left all is vacancy until you step on the opposite shore and are launched at once into the bustle and novelties of another world in travelling by land there is a continuity of scene and a connected succession of persons and incidents that carry on the story of life and lessen the effect of absence and separation we drag it is true a lengthening chain at each remove of our pilgrimage but the chain is unbroken we can trace it back link by link and we feel that the last still grapples us to home but a wide sea voyage severs us at once it makes us conscious of being cast loose from the secure anchorage of settled life and sent adrift upon a doubtful world it interposes a gulf not merely imaginary but real between us and our homes a gulf subject to tempest and fear and uncertainty rendering distance palpable and return precarious such at least was the case with myself as i saw the last blue lines of my native land fade away like a cloud in the horizon it seemed as if i had closed one volume of the world and its concerns and had time for meditation before i opened another that land too now vanishing from my view which contained all most dear to me in life what vicissitudes might occur in it what changes might take place in me before i should visit it again who can tell when he sets forth to wander whither he may be driven by the uncertain currents of existence or when he may return or whether it may be ever his lot to revisit the scenes of his childhood i said that at sea all is vacancy i should correct the impression to one given to day-dreaming and fond of losing himself in reveries a sea voyage is full of subjects for

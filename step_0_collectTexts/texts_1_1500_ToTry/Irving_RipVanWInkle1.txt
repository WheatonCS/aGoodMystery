rip van winkle whoever has made a voyage up the hudson must remember the catskill mountains they are a dismembered branch of the great appalachian family and are seen away to the west of the river swelling up to a noble height and lording it over the surrounding country every change of season every change of weather indeed every hour of the day produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains and they are regarded by all the good wives far and near as perfect barometers when the weather is fair and settled they are clothed in blue and purple and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky but sometimes when the rest of the landscape is cloudless they will gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits which in the last rays of the setting sun will glow and light up like a crown of glory at the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape it is a little village of great antiquity having been founded by some of the dutch colonists in the early times of the province just about the beginning of the government of the good peter stuyvesant may he rest in peace and there were some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years with lattice windows gable fronts surmounted with weathercocks and built of small yellow bricks brought from holland in that same village and in one of these very houses which to tell the precise truth was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten there lived many years since while the country was yet a province of great britain a simple good-natured fellow of the name of rip van winkle he was a descendant of the van winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous days of peter stuyvesant and accompanied him to the siege of fort christina he inherited however but little of the martial character of his ancestors i have observed that he was a simple good-natured man he was moreover a kind neighbor and an obedient henpecked husband indeed to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity for those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad who are under the discipline of shrews at home their tempers doubtless are rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the virtues of patience and long-suffering a termagant wife may therefore in some respects be considered a tolerable blessing and if so rip van winkle was thrice blessed certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of the village who as usual with the amiable sex took his part in all family squabbles and never failed whenever they talked those matters over in their evening gossipings to lay all the blame on dame van winkle the children of the village too would shout with joy whenever he approached he assisted at their sports made their playthings taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles and told them long stories of ghosts witches and indians whenever he went dodging about the village he was surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts clambering on his back and playing a thousand tricks on him with impunity and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood the great error in rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor it could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance for he would sit on a wet rock with a rod as long and heavy as a tartar's lance and fish all day without a murmur even though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble he would carry a fowling piece on his shoulder for hours together trudging through woods and swamps and up hill and down dale to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons he would never even refuse to assist a neighbor in the roughest toil and was a foremost man at all country frolics for husking indian corn or building stone fences the women of the village too used to employ him to run their errands and to do such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them in a word rip was ready to attend to anybody's business but his own but as to doing family duty and keeping his farm in order it was impossible in fact he declared it was of no use to work on his farm it was the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country everything about it went wrong and would go wrong in spite of him his fences were continually falling to pieces his cow would either go astray or get among the cabbages weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere else the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some outdoor work to do so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled away under his management acre by acre until there was little more left than a mere patch of indian corn and potatoes yet it was the worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood his children too were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to nobody his son rip an urchin begotten in his own likeness promised to inherit the habits with the old clothes of his father he was generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels equipped in a pair of his father's cast-off galligaskins which he had much ado to hold up with one hand as a fine lady does her train in bad weather rip van winkle however was one of those happy mortals of foolish well-oiled dispositions who take the world easy eat white bread or brown whichever can be got with least thought or trouble and would rather starve on a penny than work for a pound if left to himself he would have whistled life away in perfect contentment but his wife kept continually dinning in his ears about his idleness his carelessness and the ruin he was bringing on his family morning noon and night her tongue was incessantly going and everything he said or did was sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence rip had but one way of replying to all lectures of the kind and that by frequent use had grown into a habit he shrugged his shoulders shook his head cast up his eyes but said nothing this however always provoked a fresh volley from his wife so that he was fain to draw off his forces and take to the outside of the house the only side which in truth belongs to a henpecked husband rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog wolf who was as much henpecked as his master for dame van winkle regarded them as companions in idleness and even looked upon wolf with an evil eye as the cause of his master's so often going astray true it is in all points of spirit befitting an honorable dog he was as courageous an animal as ever scoured the woods but what courage can withstand the ever-during and all-besetting terrors of a woman's tongue the moment wolf entered the house his crest fell his tail drooped to the ground or curled between his legs he sneaked about with a gallows air casting many a sidelong glance at dame van winkle and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle would fly to the door with yelping precipitation times grew worse and worse with rip van winkle as years of matrimony rolled on a tart temper never mellows with age and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener by constant use for a long while he used to console himself when driven from home by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages philosophers and other idle personages of the village which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty george the third here they used to sit in the shade of a long lazy summer's day talking listlessly over village gossip or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing but it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing traveler how solemnly they would listen to the contents as drawled out by derrick van bummel the schoolmaster a dapper learned little man who was not to be daunted by the most

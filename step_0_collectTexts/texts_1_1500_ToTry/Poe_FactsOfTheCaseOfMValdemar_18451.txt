of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder that the extraordinary case of m valdemar has excited discussion it would have been a miracle had it not-especially under the circumstances through the desire of all parties concerned to keep the affair from the public at least for the present or until we had farther opportunities for investigation through our endeavors to effect this a garbled or exaggerated account made its way into society and became the source of many unpleasant misrepresentations and very naturally of a great deal of disbelief it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts as far as i comprehend them myself they are succinctly these my attention for the last three years had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism and about nine months ago it occurred to me quite suddenly that in the series of experiments made hitherto there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission no person had as yet been mesmerized in articulo mortis it remained to be seen first whether in such condition there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence secondly whether if any existed it was impaired or increased by the condition thirdly to what extent or for how long a period the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process there were other points to be ascertained but these most excited my curiosity the last in especial from the immensely important character of its consequences in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars i was brought to think of my friend m ernest valdemar the well-known compiler of the bibliotheca forensica and author under the nom de plume of issachar marx of the polish versions of wallenstein and gargantua m valdemar who has resided principally at harlaem ny since the year is or was particularly noticeable for the extreme spareness of his person his lower limbs much resembling those of john randolph and also for the whiteness of his whiskers in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair the latter in consequence being very generally mistaken for a wig his temperament was markedly nervous and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate his will was at no period positively or thoroughly under my control and in regard to clairvoyance i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him his physicians had declared him in a confirmed phthisis it was his custom indeed to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me it was of course very natural that i should think of m valdemar i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him and he had no relatives in america who would be likely to interfere i spoke to him frankly upon the subject and to my surprise his interest seemed vividly excited i say to my surprise for although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did his disease was of that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease it is now rather more than seven months since i received from m valdemar himself the subjoined note my dear p - you may as well come now d and f are agreed that i cannot hold out beyond to-morrow midnight and i think they have hit the time very nearly valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man's chamber i had not seen him for ten days and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him his face wore a leaden hue the eyes were utterly lustreless and the emaciation was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones his expectoration was excessive the pulse was barely perceptible he retained nevertheless in a very remarkable manner both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength he spoke with distinctness took some palliative medicines without aid and when i entered the room was occupied in penciling memoranda in a pocket-book he was propped up in the bed by pillows doctors d and f were in attendance after pressing valdemar's hand i took these gentlemen aside and obtained from them a minute account of the patient's condition the left lung had been for eighteen months in a semi-osseous or cartilaginous state and was of course entirely useless for all purposes of vitality the right in its upper portion was also partially if not thoroughly ossified while the lower region was merely a mass of purulent tubercles running one into another several extensive perforations existed and at one point permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date the ossification had proceeded with very unusual rapidity no sign of it had been discovered a month before and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurism of the aorta but on this point the osseous symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible it was the opinion of both physicians that m valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow sunday it was then seven o'clock on saturday evening on quitting the invalid's bed-side to hold conversation with myself doctors d and f had bidden him a final farewell it had not been their intention to return but at my request they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night when they had gone i spoke freely with m valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of the experiment proposed he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made and urged me to commence it at once a male and a female nurse were in attendance but i did not feel myself altogether at liberty to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people in case of sudden accident might prove i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance mr theodore l l relieved me from farther embarrassment it had been my design originally to wait for the physicians but i was induced to proceed first by the urgent entreaties of m valdemar and secondly by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidently sinking fast mr l l was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notes of all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patient's hand i begged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr l l whether he m valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of mesmerizing him in his then condition he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be i fear you have mesmerized adding immediately afterwards deferred it too long while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although i exerted all my powers no further perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock when doctors d and f called according to appointment i explained to them in a few words what i designed and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient was already in the death agony i proceeded without hesitation exchanging however the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was stertorous and at intervals of half a minute this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour at the expiration of this period however a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying

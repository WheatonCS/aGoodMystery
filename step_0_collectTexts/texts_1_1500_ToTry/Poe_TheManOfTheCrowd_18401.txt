it was well said of a certain german book that er lasst sich nicht lesen it does not permit itself to be read there are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told men die nightly in their beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyes die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed now and then alas the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave and thus the essence of all crime is undivulged not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn i sat at the large bow window of the d - coffee-house in london for some months i had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with returning strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui moods of the keenest appetency when the film from the mental vision departs the greek phrase and the intellect electrified surpasses as greatly its every-day condition as does the vivid yet candid reason of leibnitz the mad and flimsy rhetoric of gorgias merely to breathe was enjoyment and i derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain i felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing with a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap i had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon now in poring over advertisements now in observing the promiscuous company in the room and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street this latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had been very much crowded during the whole day but as the darkness came on the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door at this particular period of the evening i had never before been in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion i gave up at length all care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without at first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn i looked at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their aggregate relations soon however i descended to details and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air gait visage and expression of countenance by far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business-like demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on others still a numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces and talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around when impeded in their progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but re-doubled their gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips the course of the persons impeding them if jostled they bowed profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusion there was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what i have noted their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent they were undoubtedly noblemen merchants attorneys tradesmen stock-jobbers the eupatrids and the common-places of society men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own conducting business upon their own responsibility they did not greatly excite my attention the tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here i discerned two remarkable divisions there were the junior clerks of flash houses young gentlemen with tight coats bright boots well-oiled hair and supercilious lips setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage which may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before they wore the cast-off graces of the gentry and this i believe involves the best definition of the class the division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady old fellows it was not possible to mistake these were known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown made to sit comfortably with white cravats and waistcoats broad solid-looking shoes and thick hose or gaiters they had all slightly bald heads from which the right ears long used to pen-holding had an odd habit of standing off on end i observed that they always removed or settled their hats with both hands and wore watches with short gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern theirs was the affectation of respectability if indeed there be an affectation so honorable there were many individuals of dashing appearance whom i easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets with which all great cities are infested i watched these gentry with much inquisitiveness and found it difficult to imagine how they should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves their voluminousness of wristband with an air of excessive frankness should betray them at once the gamblers of whom i descried not a few were still more easily recognisable they wore every variety of dress from that of the desperate thimble-rig bully with velvet waistcoat fancy neckerchief gilt chains and filagreed buttons to that of the scrupulously inornate clergyman than which nothing could be less liable to suspicion still all were distinguished by a certain sodden swarthiness of complexion a filmy dimness of eye and pallor and compression of lip there were two other traits moreover by which i could always detect them a guarded lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers very often in company with these sharpers i observed an order of men somewhat different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather they may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits they seem to prey upon the public in two battalions that of the dandies and that of the military men of the first grade the leading features are long locks and smiles of the second frogged coats and frowns descending in the scale of what is termed gentility i found darker and deeper themes for speculation i saw jew pedlars with hawk eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore only an expression of abject humility sturdy professional street beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp whom despair alone had driven forth into the night for charity feeble and ghastly invalids upon whom death had placed a sure hand and who sidled and tottered through the mob looking every one beseechingly in the face as if in search of some chance consolation some lost hope modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless home and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances of ruffians whose direct contact even could not be avoided women of the town of all kinds and of all ages the unequivocal beauty in the prime of her womanhood putting one in mind of the statue in lucian with the surface of parian marble and the interior filled with filth the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags the wrinkled bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame making a last effort at youth the mere child of immature form yet from long association an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade and burning with a rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice drunkards innumerable and indescribable some in shreds and patches reeling inarticulate with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes some in whole although filthy garments with a slightly unsteady swagger thick sensual lips and hearty-looking rubicund faces others clothed in materials which had once been good and which even now were scrupulously well brushed men who walked with a more than naturally firm and springy step but whose countenances were fearfully pale whose eyes hideously wild and red and who clutched with quivering fingers as they strode through the crowd at every object which came within their reach beside these pie-men porters coal heavers sweeps organ-grinders monkey-exhibiters and ballad mongers those who vended with those who sang ragged artizans and exhausted laborers of every description and all full of a noisy and inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear and gave an aching sensation to the eye as the night deepened so deepened to me the interest of the scene for not only

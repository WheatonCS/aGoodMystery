the monikins by j fenimore cooper introduction it is not improbable that some of those who read this book may feel a wish to know in what manner i became possessed of the manuscript such a desire is too just and natural to be thwarted and the tale shall be told as briefly as possible during the summer of while travelling among those valleys of switzerland which lie between the two great ranges of the alps and in which both the rhone and the rhine take their rise i had passed from the sources of the latter to those of the former river and had reached that basin in the mountains that is so celebrated for containing the glacier of the rhone when chance gave me one of those rare moments of sublimity and solitude which are the more precious in the other hemisphere from their infrequency on every side the view was bounded by high and ragged mountains their peaks glittering near the sun while directly before me and on a level with the eye lay that miraculous frozen sea out of whose drippings the rhone starts a foaming river to glance away to the distant mediterranean for the first time during a pilgrimage of years i felt alone with nature in europe alas the enjoyment as all such enjoyments necessarily are amid the throngs of the old world was short and treacherous a party came round the angle of a rock along the narrow bridle-path in single file two ladies on horseback followed by as many gentlemen on foot and preceded by the usual guide it was but small courtesy to rise and salute the dove-like eyes and blooming cheeks of the former as they passed they were english and the gentlemen appeared to recognize me as a countryman one of the latter stopped and politely inquired if the passage of the furca was obstructed by snow he was told not and in return for the information said that i would find the grimsel a little ticklish but he added smiling the ladies succeeded in crossing and you will scarcely hesitate i thought i might get over a difficulty that his fair companions had conquered he then told me sir herbert taylor was made adjutant-general and wished me good morning i sat reflecting on the character hopes pursuits and interests of man for an hour concluding that the stranger was a soldier who let some of the ordinary workings of his thoughts overflow in this brief and casual interview to resume my solitary journey cross the rhone and toil my way up the rugged side of the grimsel consumed two more hours and glad was i to come in view of the little chill- looking sheet of water on its summit which is called the lake of the dead the path was filled with snow at a most critical point where indeed a misplaced footstep might betray the incautious to their destruction a large party on the other side appeared fully aware of the difficulty for it had halted and was in earnest discussion with the guide touching the practicability of passing it was decided to attempt the enterprise first came a female of one of the sweetest serenest countenances i had ever seen she too was english and though she trembled and blushed and laughed at herself she came on with spirit and would have reached my side in safety had not an unlucky stone turned beneath a foot that was much too pretty for those wild hills i sprang forward and was so happy as to save her from destruction she felt the extent of the obligation and expressed her thanks modestly but with fervor in a minute we were joined by her husband who grasped my hand with warm feeling or rather with the emotion one ought to feel who had witnessed the risk he had just run of losing an angel the lady seemed satisfied at leaving us together you are an englishman said the stranger an american an american this is singular will you pardon a question you have more than saved my life you have probably saved my reason will you pardon a question can money serve you i smiled and told him odd as it might appear to him that though an american i was a gentleman he appeared embarrassed and his fine face worked until i began to pity him for it was evident he wished to show me in some way how much he felt he was my debtor and yet he did not know exactly what to propose we may meet again i said squeezing his hand will you receive my card most willingly he put viscount householder into my hand and in return i gave him my own humble appellation he looked from the card to me and from me to the card and some agreeable idea appeared to flash upon his mind shall you visit geneva this summer he asked earnestly within a month your address hotel de l'ecu you shall hear from me adieu we parted he his lovely wife and his guides descending to the rhone while i pursued my way to the hospice of the grimsel within the month i received a large packet at l'ecu it contained a valuable diamond ring with a request that i would wear it as a memorial of lady householder and a fairly written manuscript the following short note explained the wishes of the writer providence brought us together for more purposes than were at first apparent i have long hesitated about publishing the accompanying narrative for in england there is a disposition to cavil at extraordinary facts but the distance of america from my place of residence will completely save me from ridicule the world must have the truth and i see no better means than by resorting to your agency all i ask is that you will have the book fairly printed and that you will send one copy to my address householder hall dorsetshire eng and another to captain noah poke stonington conn in your own country my anna prays for you and is ever your friend do not forget us yours most faithfully householder i have rigidly complied with this request and having sent the two copies according to direction the rest of the edition is at the disposal of any one who may feel an inclination to pay for it in return for the copy sent to stonington i received the following letter on board the derby and dolly stonnin'tun april st author of the spy esquire dear sir your favor is come to hand and found me in good health as i hope these few lines will have the same advantage with you i have read the book and must say there is some truth in it which i suppose is as much as befalls any book the bible the almanac and the state laws excepted i remember sir john well and shall gainsay nothing he testifies to for the reason that friends should not contradict each other i was also acquainted with the four monikins he speaks of though i knew them by different names miss poke says she wonders if it's all true which i wunt tell her seeing that a little unsartainty makes a woman rational as to my navigating without geometry thats a matter that wasn't worth booking for it's no curiosity in these parts bating a look at the compass once or twice a day and so i take my leave of you with offers to do any commission for you among the sealing islands for which i sail to- morrow wind and weather permitting yours to sarve noah poke to the author of the spy esquire -town county york state p s i always told sir john to steer clear of too much journalizing but he did nothing but write night and day for a week and as you brew so you must bake the wind has chopped and we shall take our anchor this tide so no more at present n b sir john is a little out about my eating the monkey which i did four years before i fell in with him down on the spanish main it was not bad food to the taste but was wonderful narvous to the eye i r'ally thought i had got hold of miss poke's youngest born the monikins chapter i the author's pedigree also that of his father the philosopher who broaches a new theory is bound to furnish at least some elementary proofs of the reasonableness of his positions and the historian who ventures to record marvels that have hitherto been hid from human knowledge owes it to a decent regard to the opinions of others to produce some credible testimony in favor of his veracity i am peculiarly placed in regard to these two great essentials having little more than its plausibility

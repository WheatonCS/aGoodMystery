chapter i i feel little reluctance in complying with your request you know not fully the cause of my sorrows you are a stranger to the depth of my distresses hence your efforts at consolation must necessarily fail yet the tale that i am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your sympathy in the midst of my despair i do not disdain to contribute what little i can to the benefit of mankind i acknowledge your right to be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family make what use of the tale you shall think proper if it be communicated to the world it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit it will exemplify the force of early impressions and show the immeasurable evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect discipline my state is not destitute of tranquillity the sentiment that dictates my feelings is not hope futurity has no power over my thoughts to all that is to come i am perfectly indifferent with regard to myself i have nothing more to fear fate has done its worst henceforth i am callous to misfortune i address no supplication to the deity the power that governs the course of human affairs has chosen his path the decree that ascertained the condition of my life admits of no recal no doubt it squares with the maxims of eternal equity that is neither to be questioned nor denied by me it suffices that the past is exempt from mutation the storm that tore up our happiness and changed into dreariness and desert the blooming scene of our existence is lulled into grim repose but not until the victim was transfixed and mangled till every obstacle was dissipated by its rage till every remnant of good was wrested from our grasp and exterminated how will your wonder and that of your companions be excited by my story every sentiment will yield to your amazement if my testimony were without corroborations you would reject it as incredible the experience of no human being can furnish a parallel that i beyond the rest of mankind should be reserved for a destiny without alleviation and without example listen to my narrative and then say what it is that has made me deserve to be placed on this dreadful eminence if indeed every faculty be not suspended in wonder that i am still alive and am able to relate it my father's ancestry was noble on the paternal side but his mother was the daughter of a merchant my grand-father was a younger brother and a native of saxony he was placed when he had reached the suitable age at a german college during the vacations he employed himself in traversing the neighbouring territory on one occasion it was his fortune to visit hamburg he formed an acquaintance with leonard weise a merchant of that city and was a frequent guest at his house the merchant had an only daughter for whom his guest speedily contracted an affection and in spite of parental menaces and prohibitions he in due season became her husband by this act he mortally offended his relations thenceforward he was entirely disowned and rejected by them they refused to contribute any thing to his support all intercourse ceased and he received from them merely that treatment to which an absolute stranger or detested enemy would be entitled he found an asylum in the house of his new father whose temper was kind and whose pride was flattered by this alliance the nobility of his birth was put in the balance against his poverty weise conceived himself on the whole to have acted with the highest discretion in thus disposing of his child my grand-father found it incumbent on him to search out some mode of independent subsistence his youth had been eagerly devoted to literature and music these had hitherto been cultivated merely as sources of amusement they were now converted into the means of gain at this period there were few works of taste in the saxon dialect my ancestor may be considered as the founder of the german theatre the modern poet of the same name is sprung from the same family and perhaps surpasses but little in the fruitfulness of his invention or the soundness of his taste the elder wieland his life was spent in the composition of sonatas and dramatic pieces they were not unpopular but merely afforded him a scanty subsistence he died in the bloom of his life and was quickly followed to the grave by his wife their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant at an early age he was apprenticed to a london trader and passed seven years of mercantile servitude my father was not fortunate in the character of him under whose care he was now placed he was treated with rigor and full employment was provided for every hour of his time his duties were laborious and mechanical he had been educated with a view to this profession and therefore was not tormented with unsatisfied desires he did not hold his present occupations in abhorrence because they withheld him from paths more flowery and more smooth but he found in unintermitted labour and in the sternness of his master sufficient occasions for discontent no opportunities of recreation were allowed him he spent all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment or traversing narrow and crowded streets his food was coarse and his lodging humble his heart gradually contracted a habit of morose and gloomy reflection he could not accurately define what was wanting to his happiness he was not tortured by comparisons drawn between his own situation and that of others his state was such as suited his age and his views as to fortune he did not imagine himself treated with extraordinary or unjustifiable rigor in this respect he supposed the condition of others bound like himself to mercantile service to resemble his own yet every engagement was irksome and every hour tedious in its lapse in this state of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of the teachers of the albigenses or french protestants he entertained no relish for books and was wholly unconscious of any power they possessed to delight or instruct this volume had lain for years in a corner of his garret half buried in dust and rubbish he had marked it as it lay had thrown it as his occasions required from one spot to another but had felt no inclination to examine its contents or even to inquire what was the subject of which it treated one sunday afternoon being induced to retire for a few minutes to his garret his eye was attracted by a page of this book which by some accident had been opened and placed full in his view he was seated on the edge of his bed and was employed in repairing a rent in some part of his clothes his eyes were not confined to his work but occasionally wandering lighted at length upon the page the words seek and ye shall find were those that first offered themselves to his notice his curiosity was roused by these so far as to prompt him to proceed as soon as he finished his work he took up the book and turned to the first page the further he read the more inducement he found to continue and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him for the present to close it the book contained an exposition of the doctrine of the sect of camissards and an historical account of its origin his mind was in a state peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments the craving which had haunted him was now supplied with an object his mind was at no loss for a theme of meditation on days of business he rose at the dawn and retired to his chamber not till late at night he now supplied himself with candles and employed his nocturnal and sunday hours in studying this book it of course abounded with allusions to the bible all its conclusions were deduced from the sacred text this was the fountain beyond which it was unnecessary to trace the stream of religious truth but it was his duty to trace it thus far a bible was easily procured and he ardently entered on the study of it his understanding had received a particular direction all his reveries were fashioned in the same mould his progress towards the formation of his creed was rapid every fact and sentiment in this book were viewed through a medium which the writings of the camissard apostle had suggested his constructions of the text were hasty and formed on a narrow scale every thing was viewed in a disconnected position one action and one precept were not employed to

misery is manifold the wretchedness of earth is multiform overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow its hues are as various as the hues of that arch as distinct too yet as intimately blended overreaching the wide horizon as the rainbow how is it that from beauty i have derived a type of unloveliness from the covenant of peace a simile of sorrow but as in ethics evil is a consequence of good so in fact out of joy is sorrow born either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day or the agonies which are have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been my baptismal name is egaeus that of my family i will not mention yet there are no towers in the land more time-honored than my gloomy gray hereditary halls our line has been called a race of visionaries and in many striking particulars in the character of the family mansion in the frescos of the chief saloon in the tapestries of the dormitories in the chiselling of some buttresses in the armory but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings in the fashion of the library chamber and lastly in the very peculiar nature of the library's contents there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber and with its volumes of which latter i will say no more here died my mother herein was i born but it is mere idleness to say that i had not lived before that the soul has no previous existence you deny it let us not argue the matter convinced myself i seek not to convince there is however a remembrance of aerial forms of spiritual and meaning eyes of sounds musical yet sad a remembrance which will not be excluded a memory like a shadow vague variable indefinite unsteady and like a shadow too in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist in that chamber was i born thus awaking from the long night of what seemed but was not nonentity at once into the very regions of fairy land into a palace of imagination into the wild dominions of monastic thought and erudition it is not singular that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye that i loitered away my boyhood in books and dissipated my youth in reverie but it is singular that as years rolled away and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers it is wonderful what stagnation there fell upon the springs of my life wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought the realities of the world affected me as visions and as visions only while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became in turn not the material of my every-day existence but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself berenice and i were cousins and we grew up together in my paternal halls yet differently we grew i ill of health and buried in gloom she agile graceful and overflowing with energy hers the ramble on the hill-side mine the studies of the cloister i living within my own heart and addicted body and soul to the most intense and painful meditation she roaming carelessly through life with no thought of the shadows in her path or the silent flight of the raven-winged hours berenice i call upon her name berenice and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound ah vividly is her image before me now as in the early days of her light-heartedness and joy oh gorgeous yet fantastic beauty oh sylph amid the shrubberies of arnheim oh naiad among its fountains and then then all is mystery and terror and a tale which should not be told disease a fatal disease fell like the simoon upon her frame and even while i gazed upon her the spirit of change swept over her pervading her mind her habits and her character and in a manner the most subtle and terrible disturbing even the identity of her person alas the destroyer came and went and the victim where is she i knew her not or knew her no longer as berenice among the numerous train of maladies superinduced by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature a species of epilepsy not unfrequently terminating in trance itself trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances startlingly abrupt in the mean time my own disease for i have been told that i should call it by no other appellation my own disease then grew rapidly upon me and assumed finally a monomaniac character of a novel and extraordinary form hourly and momently gaining vigor and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy this monomania if i must so term it consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive it is more than probable that i am not understood but i fear indeed that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which in my case the powers of meditation not to speak technically busied and buried themselves in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe to muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin or in the typography of a book to become absorbed for the better part of a summer's day in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry or upon the floor to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp or the embers of a fire to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower to repeat monotonously some common word until the sound by dint of frequent repetition ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind to lose all sense of motion or physical existence by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties not indeed altogether unparalleled but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation yet let me not be misapprehended the undue earnest and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous must not be confounded in character with that ruminating propensity common to all mankind and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination it was not even as might be at first supposed an extreme condition or exaggeration of such propensity but primarily and essentially distinct and different in the one instance the dreamer or enthusiast being interested by an object usually not frivolous imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom until at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury he finds the incitamentum or first cause of his musings entirely vanished and forgotten in my case the primary object was invariably frivolous although assuming through the medium of my distempered vision a refracted and unreal importance few deductions if any were made and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre the meditations were never pleasurable and at the termination of the reverie the first cause so far from being out of sight had attained that supernaturally exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease in a word the powers of mind more particularly exercised were with me as i have said before the attentive and are with the day-dreamer the speculative my books at this epoch if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder partook it will be perceived largely in their imaginative and inconsequential nature of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself i well remember among others the treatise of the noble italian coelius secundus curio de amplitudine beati regni dei st austin's great work the city of god and tertullian's de carne christi in which the paradoxical sentence mortuus est dei filius credible est quia ineptum est et sepultus resurrexit certum est quia impossibile est occupied my undivided time for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation thus it will appear that shaken from its balance only by trivial things my reason bore resemblance to that ocean-crag spoken of by ptolemy hephestion which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds trembled only to the touch of the flower called asphodel

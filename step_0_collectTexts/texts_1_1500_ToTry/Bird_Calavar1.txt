introduction nature and the memory of strange deeds of renown have flung over the valley of mexico a charm more romantic than is attached to many of the vales of the olden world for though historic association and the spell of poetry have consecrated the borders of leman and the laurel groves of tempe and providence has touched both with the finger of beauty yet does our fancy in either dwell upon objects which are not so much the adjuvants of romance as of sentiment in both we gather food rather for feeling than imagination we live over thoughts which are generated by memory and our conceptions are the reproductions of experience but poetry has added no plenary charm history has cast no over-sufficient light on the haunts of montezuma on the valley of lakes though filled with the hum of life the mysteries of backward years are yet brooding and the marvels of human destiny are whispered to our ears in the sigh of every breeze in the rustling of every tree which it stirs on the shore and in the sound of every ripple it curls up on the lake one chapter only of its history and that how full of marvels has been written or preserved the rest is a blank a single chain of vicissitudes a few consecutive links in the concatenation of events have escaped the rest is a secret strange captivating and pregnant of possibilities this is the proper field for romantic musings so at least thought a traveller or to speak more strictly a rambler whose idle wanderings from place to place directed by ennui or whim did not deserve the name of travels who sat one pleasant evening of october - on the hill of chapoltepec regarding the spectacle which is disclosed from the summit of that fair promontory the hum of the city came faintly to his ear the church-towers flung their long shadows over the gardened roofs the wildfowl flapped the white wing over the distant sheets of water which stretched in a chain from chalco to san cristobal the shouts of indian boatmen were heard at a distance on the canal of la viga and the dark forms of others trotting along the causeway that borders it were seen returning to their huts among the chinampas quiet stole over the valley the lizard crept to his hole the bat woke up in the ruined chambers of the viceroy's palace that crowns the hill of chapoltepec or started away from his den among the leaves of those mossy majestic and indeed colossal cypresses which at its base overshadow the graves of aztec kings and sultanas at last the vesper-bells sounded in the city and the sun stooped under the western hills leaving his rays still glittering with such hues as are only seen in a land of mountains on the grand peaks of popocatepetl and the white woman the farthest but yet the noblest summits of all in that girdle of mountain magnificence which seems to shut out mexico from the rest of the world as these bright tints faded into a mellow and harmonious lustre casting a sort of radiant obscurity over vale and mountain lake and steeple the thoughts of the wanderer for the romance of the spectacle and the hour had pervaded his imagination crept back to the ages of antiquity and to those mystic races of men the earliest of the land who had built their cities and dug their graves in this alpine paradise now possessed by a race of whom their world had not dreamed he gazed and mused until fancy peopled the scene around him with spectral life and his spirit's eye was opened on spectacles never more to be revealed to the corporeal organ it opened on the day when the land was a wilderness shaking for the first time under the foot of a stranger and he beheld as in a vision the various emigrations and irruptions into the vale of men born in other climates they came like the tides of ocean and as such passed away like shadows and so departed the history of ages was compressed into the representation of a moment and an hundred generations assembled together as one people rushed by in successive apparitions first over the distant ridges of nochistongo there stole or seemed to steal a multitude of men worn with travel yet bearing idols on their backs in whose honour for now they had reached their land of promise they built huge pyramids to outlive their gods and themselves and scattering over the whole plain covered it at once with cornfields and cities the historian for this unknown race brought with it science as well as religion sat him in the grove to trace the pictured annals of his age the astronomer ascended to the tower to observe the heavens and calculate the seasons of the new land while the multitude forgetting the austere climes of their nativity sat down in peace and joy under the vines and fruit-trees that made their place of habitation so beautiful thus they rested and multiplied until the barbarians of the hills the earlier races and perhaps the aborigines of the land descended to take counsel of their wisdom and follow in the ways of civilization then came a cloud bringing a pestilence in whose hot breath the rivers vanished the lakes turned to dust and the mountains to volcanoes the trees crackled and fell as before a conflagration and men lay scorched with the leaves as thick and as dead on the plain and the few who had strength to fly betook themselves to the hills and the seaside to forget their miseries and their arts and become barbarians thus began and thus ended in mexico the race of toltecs the first and the most civilized of which mexican hieroglyphics the legacy of this buried people to their successors have preserved the memory but the rains fell at last the lakes filled the forests grew and other tribes the chechemecs and acolhuacans with others many in number and strangers to each other coming from the same distant north but bringing not the civilization of the first pilgrims sat in their seats and mingling together into one people began at last after long seasons of barbarism to emerge from the gloom of ignorance and acquire the arts and understand the destinies of man to these came by the same trodden path a herd of men ruder than any who had yet visited the southern valleys aztecs in family but called by their neighbours and foes nahuatlacas or people of the lakes consisting of many tribes the chief of which was that which bore upon a throne of bulrushes an image of the god mexitli the destroyer from whom in its days of grandeur it took its name from this crew of savages the most benighted and blood-thirsty and at first the feeblest of all so base that history presents them as the only nation of bondmen known to the region of anahuac and so sordid that in the festivals of religion they could provide for their deity only the poor offering of a knife and flower fated now to fight the battles of their task-masters and now condemned to knead the bread of independence from the fetid plants and foul reptiles of the lake from this herd of barbarians grew as it seemed in a moment's space the vast the powerful and in many respects the magnificent empire of the montezumas in his mind's eye the stranger could perceive the salt tezcuco restored to its ancient limits beating again upon the porphyry hill on which he sat and the city of the island with her hundred temples and her thousand towers rising from the shadows and heaving again with the impulses of nascent civilization it was at this moment when the travail of centuries was about to be recompensed when the carved statue the work of many successive pygmalions was beginning to breathe the breath and feel the instincts of moral animation that a mysterious destiny trampled upon the little spark and crushed to atoms the body it was warming from the eastern hills came the voice of the old world the sound of the battle-trumpet the smoke of artillery rolled over the lake and in a moment more the shout of conquest and glory was answered by the groan of a dying nation as this revery ended in the brain of the stranger and the conqueror and the captive of the vision vanished away together he began to contrast in his mind the past condition of the new world with the present and particularly of those two portions which at the time of their invasion had outlived the barbarism of nature and were teeming with the evidences of incipient greatness as for this fair valley of mexico there was scarcely an object either of beauty or

addressed to parents these volumes are intended for young people from the age ten to fourteen they complete the series early lessons an humble work from which no literary fame can be acquired but which i have been most desirous to complete from the belief that it will be more useful than any other in my power i have had another motive for finishing it one which though it may be no concern the public may be permitted to name harry and lucy was begun by my father above fifty vil years ago for the use his own family and published at a time when no one any literary character excepting dr watts and mrs barbauld had ever condescended to write for children that little was i believe the very first attempt to give any correct elementary knowledge or taste for science in a narrative suited to the comprehension children and calculated to amuse and interest as well as to instruct finding from experience that it answered the intended purpose my father continued the at intervals and in the last part published in i had the pleasure assisting him he then communicated many ideas for the completion his plan which i thought too valuable to be abandoned i considered that a full knowledge his views and long habits acquaintance with his mode teaching might enable me to do justice to his plan though i was aware the difficulty combining ingenious with practicable illustrations and still more sensible the accuracy requisite for elementary instruction the want his mind working along with my own i knew must be in this attempt peculiarly felt but i have been encouraged to persevere by the assistance afforded me by his and my own scientific friends to name these kind and able friends would gratify my vanity and might ensure the confidence parents but it would perhaps have more the appearance ostentation than candour and mightleave others responsible for errors which have escaped the most careful revisal i have endeavoured to pursue in this conclusion early lessons my father's object in their commencement to exercise the powers attention observation reasoning and invention rather than to teach any one science or to make any advance beyond first principles the essential point is to excite a thirst for knowledge without which it is in vain to pour the full tide even to the lips as dr johnson said to boswell when he was describing the pains his preceptors had taken to give him learning sir anybody can bring a horse to the water but who can make him drink consistently with the sort instruction to be conveyed it was impossible to give as much the amusement arising from incident and story in this as in some others but the varying occurrences domestic life the frequent changes scene and the different characters the children with all their hopes and fears in the pursuit their own little schemes and experiments will i hope produce sufficient action to create interest and to keep awake attention no pernicious stimulus has been driven no deception or cajolery employed to effect our purpose all attempts to cheat children by the false promise that they can obtain knowledge without labour are vain and hurtful the gods sell everything to labour and mortals young or old must pay that price the wages industry should however be rendered ascertain as possible for the pupils will exert themselves in proportion to their hopes that their efforts will be recompensed by the pleasure success i have taken all the precautions in my power to secure to each effort attention its just reward much that would be tiresome and insufferable to young people if offered by preceptors in a didactic tone weill be eagerly accepted when suggested in conversation especially in conversations bell tween themselves in these there is always a certain proportion nonsense an alloy which is necessary to make sense work well children can go on talking to one another much longer than they can bear to hear the address however wise or eloquent any grown person young people good disposition learn with peculiar ease from each other because the young teacher has not forgotten his own difficulties knowing exactly where they lay he sees how to remove them or to assist another over the obstacles the great preceptor standing on the top the ladder learning can hardly stretch his hand down to the poor urchin at the bottom looking upto him in despair but an intermediate companion who is only a few steps above can assist him with a helping hand can show him where to put his foot safely and now urging now encouraging can draw him up to any height within his own attainment the system mutual instruction can be still more advantageously pursued in teaching the rudiments science than those literature and may be extended even to higher branches intellectual education upon this principle in the following volumes the young brother is employed to teach his sister what he has learned either from his father or from books harry's abilities and knowledge will perhaps appear a little above his age but this the reader must excuse and attribute as he pleases to education or to accident or to natural genius harry will not be disliked because he is not pedantic and he has some redeeming faults and foibles which save him from the odium attached to a perfect character and from the danger being thought too good to be natural lucy on the other hand may at times seem too childish and volatile her respect for accuracy not being at first much greater than that the sailor who said we'll not quarrel for a handful degrees but these faults produce the nonsense and the action necessary to relieve the reader's attention as to the danger and the penalties her becoming an affected scientific lady it is left to her mother's and her own good sense and good taste to guard against that evil all that can be said or thought upon the subject by the other sex is comprised in the edinburgh wit's declaration i do not care how blue a lady's stockings may be if her petticoats are but long enough my father long ago foresaw what everypreface body now feels that the taste for scientific as well as literary knowledge which has risen rapidly and has spread widely would render it necessary to make some provision for the early instruction youth in science in addition to the oreat and successful attention paid to classical literature in public establishments alterations even when felt to be requisite must for many reasons be tardy much in the mean time may be prepared by private instruction it has been feared by some that the general diffusion knowledge will tend to damp the energy genius and that original invention will decline in consequence increased cultivation this might perhaps be the consequence injudicious cultivation if the acquisition a great quantity learning all kinds or any kind were made the sole and ultimate object the mind would be opxvi pressed and invention extinguished under the mass but this there is no danger if the faculties be proportionably exercised and if the pupil be enabled to arrange and above all to employ his knowledge in science the hope future discoveries and the ambition to invent are great natural and neverfailing excitements to young and old that very ingenious and very mysterious philosopher dr hooke speaks somewhere in his works an algebraic formula by which he could determine what things are possible or impossible to perform or to invent without perfectly crediting or perfectly understanding this veiled prophet we may hope and believe that the inventive power may be assisted and improved by exercise by reasoning and by judicious experiments many admirable observations on the nature and conduct the understanding on the causes which have prevented our advancement in knowledge and on the habits false reasoning prepossessions and prejudices which enslave and disable our faculties are to be found in the works bacon and hooke locke stewart and mayfair these observations should not be suffered to lie dormant in books the admiration only the learned nor should we be content with merely citing them occasionally to adorn our writings or to point our conversation metaphysics after being too much in fashion have been thrown aside too disdainfully and their use and abuse have been confounded surely it would be doing good service to bring into popular form all that metaphysicians have discovered which can be applied to practice in education this was early and long my father's object the art teaching to inr vent i dare not say but awakening and assisting the inventive power by daily exercise and excitement and by the application philosophic principles to trivial occurrences he believed might be pursued sith infinite advantage to the rising generation i have now stated all the objects this how far they have been accomplished must be left to time and

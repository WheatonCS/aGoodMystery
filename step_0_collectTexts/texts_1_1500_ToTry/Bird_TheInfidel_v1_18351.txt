the infidel chapter i the traveller who wanders at the present day along the northern and eastern borders of the lake of tezcuco searches in vain for those monuments of aboriginal grandeur which surrounded it in the age of montezuma the lake itself which not so much from the saltness of its flood as from the vastness of its expanse was called by cortes the sea of anahuac is no longer worthy of the name the labours of that unhappy race of men whose bondage the famous conquistador cemented in the blood of their forefathers have conducted through the bowels of a mountain the waters of its great tributaries the pools of san cristobal and zumpango and these rushing down the channel of the tula or river of montezuma and mingled with the surges of the great gulf support fleets of modern argosies instead of piraguas and chinampas and expend upon foundering ships-of-war the wrath which in their ancient beds was wasted upon reeds and bulrushes with the waters which rippled through their streets have vanished the numberless towns and cities that once beautified the margin of the alpine sea the towers have fallen the lofty pyramids melted into earth or air and the palaces and tombs of kings will be looked for in vain under tangled copses of thistle and prickly-pear the royal city of tezcuco is now though the capital of a republican state a mean and insignificant village it was originally the metropolis of a kingdom once more ancient and powerful than that of mexico and which when it had shared the fate of all others within the bounds of anahuac and acknowledged the sway of the island kings still preserved the reputed and perhaps the real possession of superior civilization its princes in becoming the feudatories became also the electors of mexico and thus added dignity to an independence which was only nominal the polished character of these barbarous chieftains as the world has been taught to esteem them may be better understood when we know that they sowed the roadside with corn for the sustenance of travellers and the protection of husbandmen built hospitals and observatories endowed colleges and formed associations of literature and science in which to compare small things with great as in the learned societies of modern europe and america encouragement was given to the study of history poetry music painting astronomy and natural magic the various mechanical trades were divided into corporate bodies and assigned each to some particular quarter of the city courts and councils were regularly established and the laws which they dispensed digested into uniform and written codes some of which are still preserved the kings of tezcuco themselves mingled in the generous rivalries which they fomented there are still in existence at least in the form of translation several of the odes of nezahualcojotl a royal tezcucan poet and his hymns to the creator composed half a century before the advent of the spaniards were admired and chanted by the conquerors until devoted by misjudging and fanatical missionaries to the flames which consumed the written histories and laws of the kingdom as well as the idolatrous rituals of the priests with which last the others were unfortunately confounded footnote these poems we presume were handed down orally we know not how far the picture-writing of the mexicans the art of interpreting which appears to be now lost was capable of conveying any such thoughts as could not be represented by an absolute portrait no system of writing that is not essentially phonetic or dialectical i e representative of sounds or of language can be made to express abstract ideas which may be defined to be such as admit of no ideographic or metaphoric representation if they could mankind might at once enjoy the benefits of the universal language or to speak strictly a substitute for it for it would convey ideas not words which leibnitz dreamed of and bishop wilkins and many others after him so vainly attempted to construct when therefore we relate any very curious and marvellous matters appertaining to mexican literature though we speak upon the authority of historians we invite the reader to receive our accounts with some grains of allowance with the exception of a few arbitrary symbols expressive of numerals and a few other objects of constant recurrence the picture-writing of mexico spoke in ideas not words and it may therefore be assumed that it could express nothing that did not or by a stretch of ingenuity could not be made to address and explain itself to the eye a few ruins a cluster of dilapidated houses a galloping creole on his high spanish saddle with glittering manga and rattling anquera and now and then an indian skulking moodily along in his squalid serape are all that remain of tezcuco footnote the manga and serape are mexican cloaks worn scapulary-wise the one of richly embroidered cloth the other of blanket or some such coarse material the anquera is a leather housing embossed and gilt with a jingling fringe of brass or silver ornaments in the spring of the year that followed the flight of the spaniards from mexico the city of the acolhuacanese presented all its grandeur of aspect and to the eye looked full as royal and imperishable as in the best days of its freedom but the molewarp was digging at its foundations and the cloud which had ravaged the mexican valley and then passed away into the east where it lay for a time still and small like to a man's hand had again crept over the mountain barriers to its gates and was now brooding among its sanctuaries a group of christian men sat under a cypress-tree without the walls regarding the great pyramid on whose lofty terrace overshadowing the surrounding edifices floated a crimson banner of velvet and gold on which besides the royal arms of spain was emblazoned as on the labarum of the constantines a white cross with the legend imitated from that famous standard of fanaticism in hoc signo vincemus if other proof had been wanting of the return of the spaniards to the scene of their discomfiture their presence in tezcuco and their unchangeable resolution to complete the work of conquest so disastrously begun it might have been traced abundantly in the strange spectacle which equally with the desecrated temple divided the attention of the group of castilians at the cypress-tree they sat on a little swell of earth a natural mound which jutted into the lake whose waters agitated by a western breeze dashed in musical breakers at its base while the rustling of the leaves above mingled with these sounds of waves a tone that was both melancholy and harmonious the beautiful prospect of tezcuco rising beyond fertile meadows in the livery of spring flanked on the right hand by a sheet of dark and glossy water with white towers turrets and temple-tops painted as it seemed on a background of mountains of the purest azure was enough of itself to engross the admiration of a looker-on had there not been presented hard by a scene still more singular and romantic a train of warriors artificers and labourers the latter bending under such burthens as had never before descended to the verge of tezcuco was seen passing at a little distance towards the city into which as was denoted by a sudden explosion of artillery and the blast of trumpets on the top of the pyramid the leaders were just entering while the rear of the procession extending for miles and winding like some mighty snake over hill and meadow was lost among distant forests the martial salutation from the town was answered by the whole train with a yell filling the air and causing the distant hills and lakes to tremble with the reverberation in this the ear might detect besides the war-cry of indians tlascala tlascala the not less piercing shouts of spaniards in the name of god and santiago as well as the flourish of bugles scattered at intervals among the train if the broad sea of anahuac trembled at the sound it was with good reason for the clamour of triumph indicated the approach of those unknown naval engines which were to plough its undefiled bosom and convert every billow into the vassal of the stranger on the shoulders of eight thousand tlascalans were borne the materials for the construction of thirteen brigantines with which the unconquerable spaniard capable of every expedient meditated the complete investment and the certain reduction of tenochtitlan the iron the sails and cordage of that fleet which he had caused to be broken up and sunk in the harbour of vera cruz were added to planks spars and timbers from the sierras of tlascala and to pitch and rosin from the pinales or pine-forests of huexotzinco a gloomy and broken desert notorious in the present day as the haunt of bandits

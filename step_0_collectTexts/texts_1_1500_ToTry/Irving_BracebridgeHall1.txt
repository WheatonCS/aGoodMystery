hunting on the skirts the neighbouring village there lives a kind small potentate who for aught i know is a representative one the most ancient legitimate lines the present day for the empire over

oaken chair his ancestors the personage to whom ready money jack i allude is a sturdy old yeoman the name john tibbets or rather ready money jack tibbets as he is called throughout the neighbourhood the first place where he attracted my attention was in the churchyard on sunday where he sat on a tombstone after the service with his hat a little on one side holding forth to a small circle auditors and as i presumed expounding the law and the prophets until on drawing a little nearer i found he was only expatiating on the merits a brown horse he presented such a picture a substantial english

his hat band his sleeve buttons were gold seven shilling pieces and he had two or three guineas hanging as ornaments to his watch chain on making some inquiries about him i gathered that he was

important character in the place when a youngster he ready money jack was one the most roaring blades the neighbourhood no one could match him at wrestling pitching the bar cudgel play and other

when jack's father died the neighbours shook their heads and predicted that young hopeful would soon make way with the old homestead but jack falsified all their predictions the moment he succeeded to

boisterous jovial companion he is seldom known to laugh in the midst his gayety but maintains the same lionlike demeanour he is very slow at comprehending a joke and is apt to sit puzzling at it with a perplexed look while the rest the company are in a roar this gravity has perhaps grown on him with the growing weight his character for he is gradually growing into patriarchal dignity in his native place though he no longer takes an active part in athletic sports yet he always presides at them and is appealed to on all occasions as umpire he maintains the peace on the vilmerry night a rustic

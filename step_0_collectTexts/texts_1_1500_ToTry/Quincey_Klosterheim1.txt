the winter had set in with unusual severity throughout qualia and bavaria though as yet scarcely advanced beyond the first week november it was in fiwrt at the point when our tale commences the th that month or in our modem computation the th long after which date it had been customary late years inter any ordinary state the weather to extend the course military operations and without much decline vigour latterly indeed it had become apparent that entire winter campaigns without either formal suspensions hostilities or even partial relaxations had entered professedly as a point policy into the system warfare which now swept over germany klostebheih in full career threatening soon to convert its vast central provinces so recently blooming eden peace and expanding prosperity into a

the weather so tierce had been the cold for the last forts kbich twe ii man i gnat dislioiioiir if frenv in the tturtj yeim ww klosterheibt night and so premature that a pretty confident anticipation had arisen in all quarters throughout the poor exhausted land a general armistice and as this once established would offer a ready opening to some measure permanent pacification it could not be surprising that the natural hopefulness the human heart long oppressed by gloomy prospects should open with unusual readiness to the first colourable dawn happier times in fact the reaction in the public spirits was sudden and universal it happened also that the particular occasion this change prospect brought with it a separate pleasure on its own account winter which by its peculiar severity had created the apparent necessity for an armistice brought many household pleasures in its train associated immemorially with that season in all northern climates the cold which had casually opened a

were leon crowding from an early hour to the city walls and returning homewards at intervals with anxiaog and dissatisfied looks groups both sees were collected at every corner the rider streets keenly debating or angrily protesting at one time denouncing vengeance to horae great enemy at another passionately lamenting some past or halfforgotten calamity recalled to their thoughts whilst anticipating a similar catastrophe for the present day above all the great square upon which the ancient castellated palace or schloss opened by one its fronts as well as a principal convent the city

germany under the particular circumstances its situation had greatly increased that klosterheim judging by the tone which prevailed and the random expressions wlucli fell upon the ear at intervals a stnwir might conjecture that it was no empty lamentation over impending evils which occupied this crowd but some serious preparation for meaning or redressing them an officer sora distinction had been

countenance those the lower rank were silent as he moved languor lowered theirvoices into whispers and inaudible murmurs amongst the students however whenever they happened to minster stnragly were many fiery young men who disdained to temperate expression their feelings or to moderate their tone a large group these at one comer the square lrew attention upon themselves as well by the

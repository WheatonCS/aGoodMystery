i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers they all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i have never been quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it over-niceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais gargantua to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moment's notice in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he required something in the way of folly if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers not to mention himself his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already observed your jesters in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred are fat round and unwieldy so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that in hop-frog this was the fool's name he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person i believe the name hop-frog was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of the several ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men do in fact hop-frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait something between a leap and a wriggle a movement that afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a capital figure but although hop-frog through the distortion of his legs could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question or any thing else to climb at such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog i am not able to say with precision from what country hop-frog originally came it was from some barbarous region however that no person ever heard of a vast distance from the court of our king hop-frog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces and sent as presents to the king by one of his ever-victorious generals under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became sworn friends hop-frog who although he made a great deal of sport was by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta many services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit of hop-frog on some grand state occasion i forgot what the king determined to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind occurred at our court then the talents both of hop-frog and trippetta were sure to be called into play hop-frog in especial was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it seems without his assistance the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been fitted up under trippetta's eye with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made up their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhere except in the case of the king and his seven minsters why they hesitated i never could tell unless they did it by way of a joke more probably they found it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds at all events time flew and as a last resort they sent for trippetta and hop-frog when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that hop-frog was not fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his practical jokes and took pleasure in forcing hop-frog to drink and as the king called it to be merry come here hop-frog said he as the jester and his friend entered the room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here hop-frog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention we want characters characters man something novel out of the way we are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the wine will brighten your wits hop-frog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king but the effort was too much it happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant ah ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker see what a glass of good wine can do why your eyes are shining already poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous he placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the company with a half insane stare they all seemed highly amused at the success of the king's joke and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man yes said the king come lend us your assistance characters my fine fellow we stand in need of characters all of us ha ha ha and as this was seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven hop-frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you mean by that ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath drink i say shouted the monster or by the fiends- the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarch's seat and falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or say how most becomingly to express his indignation

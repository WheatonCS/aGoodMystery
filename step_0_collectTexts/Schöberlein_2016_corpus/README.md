### Interested in another alternate corpus?

Although beyond the scope of this work, here are some snippets of communication with Stefan Schoeberlein after reading his paper:

Schöberlein, S. (2016). Poe or Not Poe? A Stylometric Analysis of Edgar Allan Poe’s Disputed Writings. Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, July 24, 2016.

i very much enjoyed your article 'poe or not poe? ...' (DigScholarship in Humanities, 2016);

** would it be possible to receive the data files (texts) that you used?

I've also recently talked to Jerome McGann, who mentioned a few pieces that appeared in the Broadway Journal under Poe's editorship that I haven't really paid attention to but that he's sure could be Poe's. The lists I was basing my selection of possible Poe texts on (from the Poe Society) was apparently a bit dated and there's probably more out there that ought to be tested as well.

McGann mentioned that he discusses these pieces in a book of his--I'm assuming he's referring to Poe and the Remapping of Antebellum Print Culture. But I'm sure he would also be very willing to answer emails--though I'm certain he doesn't remember me (we only spoke briefly after a conference talk).

I've also been playing with the idea of contacting the The Edgar Allan Poe Review at some point to see if they'd be interested in a sort of updated version of my paper that minimizes the DH / methodology aspects and tests a few more Poe texts. I'm sure they'd be able to help add some great suggestions. But I probably won't be doing that in the immediate future, so that might be a good place for you to go as well.

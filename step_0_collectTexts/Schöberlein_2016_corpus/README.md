### Interested in another alternate corpus?

After finishing this preliminary analysis, I read a paper by Stefan Schöberlein.As you'll note below, I asked Stefan to share his text files that he used and he graciously agreed. Although beyond the scope of this work, some readers may be interested in using his texts to reproduce his work and/or explore new tests with Poe attribution. For the record, here are some snippets of email communication we had with Stefan Schoeberlein after reading his paper:

Schöberlein, S. (2016). Poe or Not Poe? A Stylometric Analysis of Edgar Allan Poe’s Disputed Writings. *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*, July 24, 2016.

i very much enjoyed your article 'poe or not poe? ...' (DigScholarship in Humanities, 2016);

** would it be possible to receive the data files (texts) that you used?

Dear Mark,

thanks for your kind words about my paper. It's actually the result of a graduate seminar I took where we replicated Jockers as well--so of course I'd love to share my data. I've attached zip files with the respective texts and comparison corpora. 

...

I've also recently talked to Jerome McGann, who mentioned a few pieces that appeared in the Broadway Journal under Poe's editorship that I haven't really paid attention to but that he's sure could be Poe's. The lists I was basing my selection of possible Poe texts on (from the Poe Society) was apparently a bit dated and there's probably more out there that ought to be tested as well.

McGann mentioned that he discusses these pieces in a book of his--I'm assuming he's referring to Poe and the Remapping of Antebellum Print Culture. But I'm sure he would also be very willing to answer emails--though I'm certain he doesn't remember me (we only spoke briefly after a conference talk).

I've also been playing with the idea of contacting the The Edgar Allan Poe Review at some point to see if they'd be interested in a sort of updated version of my paper that minimizes the DH / methodology aspects and tests a few more Poe texts. I'm sure they'd be able to help add some great suggestions. But I probably won't be doing that in the immediate future, so that might be a good place for you to go as well.

i take great pleasure in accompanying the
squire in his perambulations about his estate
in which he is often attended by a kind cabinet
council his prime minister the steward is a
very worthy and honest old man and one those
veteran retainers that assume a right way 
that is to say a right to have his own way from
having lived time out mind on the place he
loves the estate even better than he does the 
 english country gentlemen
squire and thwarts the latter sadly in many 
his projects improvement and alteration indeed
the old man is a little apt to oppose every
plan that does not originate with himself and
will hold long arguments about it over a stile
or on a rise ground until the squire who hasa
high opinion his ability and integrity is fain
to give up the point such concession immediately
mollifies the old steward and it often happens
that after walking a field or two in silence
with his hands behind his back chewing the cud
 reflection he will suddenly observe that he
has been turning the matter over in his mind
and upon the whole he thinks he will take his
honour's advice
christy the huntsman is another the squire's
frequent attendants to whom he continually refers
in matters local history as to a chronicle
 the estate having been in a manner acquainted
with many the trees from the very
time that they were acorns old nimrod as i
have already shown is rather pragmatical on all
these points knowledge upon which he values
english country gentlemen 
himself but the squire never contradicts him 
and is certainly one the most indulgent potentates
that was ever henpecked by his ministers
he often laughs about it himself and evidently
yields to these old men in compliance
with the bent his own humour he likes this
honest independence old age for with all his
aristocratical feelings there is nothing that disgusts
him sooner than any appearance fawning
or servility
i really have seen no display royal state
that could compare with one the squire's
progresses about his paternal fields and through
his hereditary woodlands with several these
faithful adherents about him and followed by a
body guard dogs he encourages a frankness
and manliness deportment among his
dependants and is the personal friend his
tenants inquiring into their concerns and assisting
them in times difficulty and hardship
this has rendered him one the most popular
and course one the happiest landlords

 english country gentlemen
indeed i do not know a more enviable condition
 life than that an english gentleman
 sound judgment and good feelings who passes
the greater part his time on an hereditary estate
in the country from the excellence the
roads and the rapidity and exactness the public
conveyances he is enabled to command all
the comforts and conveniences all the intelligence
and novelties the capital while he is
removed from its hurry and distractions he
has ample means occupation and amusement
within his own domains he may diversify his
time by rural occupations by rural sports by
study and by the delights friendly society
collected within his own hospitable halls
or if his views and feelings are a more extensive
and liberal nature he has it greatly in his
power to do good and to have that good immediately
reflected back upon himself he can
render essential service to his country by assisting
in the disinterested administration the
laws by watching over the opinions and principles
 the lower orders around him by diff
country gentlemen 
fusing among them those lights which may be
important to their welfare by mingling frankly
among them gaining their confidence becoming
the immediate auditor their complaints
 informing himself their wants making
himself a channel through which their grievances
may be quietly communicated to the proper
sources mitigation and relief or by
becoming if need be the intrepid and incorruptible
guardian their liberties the enlightened
champion their rights
all this it appears to me can be done without
any sacrifice personal dignity without any
degrading arts popularity without any truckling
to vulgar prejudices or concurrence in vulgar
clamour but by the steady influence sincere
and friendly council fair upright and
generous deportment whatever may be said 
english mobs and english demagogues i have
never met with a people more open to reason 
more considerate in their tempers more tractable
by argument in the roughest times than the
english they are remarkably quick at dist
english country gentlemen
morning and appreciating whatever is manly and
honourable they are by nature and habit methodical
and orderly and feel the value all
that is regular and respectable they may occasionally
be deceived by sophistry and excited
into turbulence by public distresses and the misrepresentations
 designing men but open their
eyes and they will eventually rally round the
landmarks steady truth and deliberate good
sense they are fond established customs 
they are fond long established names and
that love order and quiet which characterizes
the nation gives a vast influence to the descendants
 the old families whose forefathers have
been lords the soil from time immemorial
it is when the rich and well educated and
highly privileged classes neglect their duties 
when they neglect to study the interests and
conciliate the affections and instruct the opinions
and champion the rights the people
that the latter become discontented and turbulent
and fall into the hands demagogues
the demagogue always steps in where the paenglish
country gentlemen 
trot is wanting there is a common high
handed cant among high feeding and as they
fancy themselves high minded men about putting
down the mob but all true physicians
know that it is better to sweeten the blood than
to attack the tumour to apply the emollient
rather than the cautery
it is absurd in a country like england where
there is so much freedom and such a jealousy
 right for any man to assume an aristocratical
tone and to talk superciliously the common
people there is no rank that makes him
independent the opinion and affections his
fellow men there is no rank nor distinction
that severs him from his fellow subject and if
by any gradual neglect or assumption on the
one side and discontent and jealousy on the
other the orders society should really separate
let those that stand on the eminence beware
that the chasm is not mining at their feet
the orders society in all well constituted
governments are mutually bound together and
important to each other there can be no such
 english country gentlemen
thing in a free government as a vacuum and
wherever one is likely to take place by the
drawing off the rich and intelligent from the
poor the bad passions society will rush in r
to fill up the space and rend the whole asunder
though born and brought up in a republic
and more and more confirmed in republican
principles by every year's observation and experience
yet i am not insensible to the excellence
that may exist in other forms government
 nor to the fact that they may be more
suitable to the situation and circumstances 
the countries in which they exist i have endeavoured
rather to look at them as they are
and to observe how they are calculated to effect
the which they propose considering
therefore the mixed nature the government
 this country and its representative form i
have looked with admiration at the manner in
which the wealth and influence and intelligence
were spread over its whole surface not
as in some monarchies drained from the country
and collected in towns and cities i have
english country gentlemen 
considered the great rural establishments the
nobility and the lesser establishments the
gentry as so many reservoirs wealth and intelligence
distributed about the kingdom apart
from the towns to irrigate freshen and fertilize
the surrounding country have looked
upon them too as the august retreats patriots
and statesmen where in the enjoyment 
honourable independence and elegant leisure
they might train up their minds to appear in
those legislative assemblies whose debates and
decisions form the study and precedents 
other nations and involve the interests the
world
i have been both surprised and disappointed
therefore at finding that on this subject i was
often indulging in a utopian dream rather thana
well grounded opinion i have been concerned
at finding that these fine estates were too
often involved and mortgaged or placed in the
hands creditors and the owners exiled from
their paternal lands there is an extravagance
i am told that runs parallel with wealth a lavish
vol 
ib english country gentlemen
expenditure among the great a senseless competition
among the aspiring a heedless joyless
dissipation among all the upper ranks that often
beggars even these splendid establishments
breaks down the pride and principles their
possessors and makes too many them mere
place hunters or shifting absentees it is thus
that so many are thrown into the hands government
 and a court which ought to be the
most pure and honourable in europe is so often
degraded by noble but importunate timeservers
it is thus too that so many become exiles from
their native land crowding the hotels foreign
nations and expending upon thankless strangers
the wealth so hardly drained from their laborious
peasantry having as it were their roots in their
own country but spreading forth their branches
and bearing their fruits in another i have looked
upon these latter with a mixture censure
and concern knowing the almost bigotted
fondness an englishman for his native home
i can conceive what must be their compunction
and regret when they call to mind amidst the
english country gentlemen 
sunburnt plains france the green fields 
england the hereditary groves which they have
abandoned the hospitable roof their fathers
which they have left desolate or to be inhabited
by strangers but retrenchment is no plea for
an abandonment country they have risen
with the prosperity the land let them abide its
fluctuations and conform to its fortunes it is
not for the rich to draw off from the country because
it is suffering let them share in their
relative proportion the common lot they owe
it to the land that has elevated them to honour
and affluence when the poor have to diminish
their scanty morsel bread when they have
to compound with the cravings nature and
study with how little they can do and not be
starved it is not then for the rich to fly and
diminish still farther the resources the poor
that they themselves may live in splendour in a
cheaper country let them rather retire to their
estates and there practise retrenchment let
them return to that noble simplicity that practical
good sense that honest pride which form the
 english country gentlemen
foundation true english character and from
them they may again rear the edifice fair and
honourable prosperity
on the rural habits the english nobility
and gentry on the manner in which they discharge
their duties on their patrimonial possessions
depend greatly the virtue and welfare 
the nation so long as they pass the greater
part their time in the quiet and purity the
country surrounded by the monuments their
illustrious ancestors surrounded by every thing
that can inspire generous pride noble emulation
and amiable and magnanimous sentiment
so long they are safe and in them the nation
may repose its interests and its honour but
the moment that they become the servile thronged
 court avenues and give themselves up to
the political intrigues and heartless dissipations
 the metropolis that moment they lose the
real nobility their natures and become the
mere leeches the country
that the great majority nobility and gentry
in england are endowed with high notions
english country gentlemen 
 honour and independence i thoroughly believe
they have evidenced it lately on very
important questions and have given an example
 adherence to principle in preference to
party and power that must have astonished
many the venal and obsequious courts 
europe such are the glorious effects freedom
even when infused into a constitution but
it seems to me that they are apt to forget the positive
nature their duties and to fancy that
their eminent privileges are only so many means
 self indulgence they should recollect that
in a constitution like that england the titled
orders are intended to be as useful as they are
ornamental and it is their virtues alone that
can render them both their duties are divided
between the sovereign and the subject surrounding
and giving lustre and dignity to the throne
and at the same time tempering and mitigating
its rays until they are transmitted in mild and
genial radiance to the people born to leisure
and opulence they owe the exercise their
talents and the expenditure their wealth to
 english country gentlemen
their native country they may be compared
to the clouds which being drawn up by the
sun and elevated in the heavens reflect and
magnify his splendour while they repay the
earth from which they derive their sustenance
by returning their treasures to its bosom in fertilizing
showers
a bachelor's confessions
i'll live a private pensive single life
the collier croydon
i was sitting in my room a morning or two
since reading when some one tapped at the
door and master simon entered he had an
unusually fresh appearance he had put on a
bright green riding coat with a bunch violets
in the button hole and had the air an old
bachelor trying to remunerate himself he had
not however his usual briskness and vivacity
but loitered about the room with somewhat 
absence manner humming the old song go
lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and
me and then leaning against the window and
looking upon the landscape he uttered a very 
a bachelor's confessions
bible sigh as i had not been accustomed to
see master simon in a pensive mood i thought
there might be some vexation preying on his
mind and i endeavoured to introduce a cheerful
strain conversation but he was not in the
vein to follow it up and proposed that we should
take a walk it w r as a beautiful morning 
that soft vernal temperature that seems to thaw
all the frost out one's blood and to set all nature
in a ferment the very fishes felt its influence
 the cautious trout ventured out his dark
hole to seek his mate the roach and the dace
rose up to the surface the brook to bask in the
sunshine and the amorous frog piped from among
the rushes if ever an oyster can really fall in
love as has been said or sung it must be on such
a morning
the weather certainly had its effect even upon
master simon for he seemed obstinately bent
upon the pensive mood instead skipping
briskly along smacking his dog whip whistling
quaint ditties or telling sporting anecdotes he
leaned on my arm and talked about the 
bachelor's confessions 
preaching nuptials from whence he made several
digressions upon the character women 
touched a little upon the tender passion and
made sundry very excellent though rather trite
observations upon disappointments in love it
was evident that he had something on his mind
which he wished to impart but felt awkward in
approaching it i was curious to see to what
this strain would lead but i was determined not
to assist him indeed i mischievously pretended
to turn the conversation and talked his
usual topics dogs horses and hunting but he
w as very brief in his replies and invariably got
back by hook or by crook into the sentimental
vein at length we came to a clump trees
that overhung a whispering brook with a rustic
bench at their feet the trees were grievously
scored with letters and devices which had grown
out all shape and size by the growth the
bark and it appeared that this grove had served
as a kind register the family loves from
time immemorial here master simon made
a pause pulled up a tuft flowers threw
vol 
 a bachelor's confessions
them one by one into the water and at length
turning somewhat abruptly upon me asked me
if i had ever been in love i confess the question
startled me a little as i am not over fond 
making confessions my amorous follies and
above all should never dream choosing my
friend master simon for a confidant he did
not wait however for a reply the inquiry was
merely a prelude to a confession on his own
part and after several circumlocutions and whimsical
preambles he fairly disburdened himself
 a very tolerable story his having been crossed
in love
the reader will very probably suppose that it
related to the gay widow who jilted him not
long since at doncaster races no such thing
it was about a sentimental passion that he
once had for a most beautiful young lady who
wrote poetry and played on the harp he used
to serenade her and indeed he described several
tender and gallant scenes in which he evidently
was picturing himself in his mind's eye as some
elegant hero romance though unfortunately
a bachelor's confessions 
for the tale i only saw him as he stood before
me a dapper little old bachelor with a face like
an apple that has dried with the bloom on it
what were the particulars this tender tale
i have already forgotten indeed i listened to it
with a heart like a very pebble stone having
hard work to repress a smile while master simon
was putting on the amorous swain uttering
every now and then a sigh and endeavouring to
look sentimental and melancholy
all that i recollect is that the lady according
to his account was certainly a little touched
for she used to accept all the music that he
copied for her harp and the patterns that he
drew for her dresses and he began to flatter
himself after a long course delicate attentions
that he was gradually fanning a gentle flame in
her heart when she suddenly accepted the hand
 a rich boisterous foxhunting baronet without
either music or sentiment who carried herby
storm after a fortnight's courtship master
simon could not help concluding by some obser
a bachelor's confessions
nation about modest merit and the power
 gold over the sex as a remembrance 
his passion he pointed out a heart carved on
the bark one the trees but which in the
process time had grown out into a large
excrescence and he showed me a lock her
hair which he wore in a true lover's knot in a
large gold brooch
j have seldom met with an old bachelor that
had not some time or other his nonsensical moment
when he would become tender and sentimental
talk about the concerns the heart
and have some confession a delicate nature
to make almost every man has some little
tract romance in his life to which he looks
back with fondness and about which he is apt
to grow garrulous occasionally he recollects
himself as he was at the time young and gamesome
 and forgets that his hearers have no other
idea the hero the tale but such as he may
appear at the time telling it peradventure a
withered whimsical spindleshanked old gentle
bachelor's confessions 
men with married men it is true this is not
so frequently the case their amorous romance
is apt to decline after marriage why i cannot
for the life me imagine but with a bachelor
though it may slumber it never dies it is always
liable to break out again in transient flashes
and never so much as on a spring morning in the
country or on a winter evening when seated in
his solitary chamber stirring up the fire and
talking matrimony
the moment that master simon had gone
through his confession and to use the common
phrase had made a clean breast it he became
quite himself again he had settled the
point which had been worrying his mind and
doubtless considered himself established as a
man sentiment in my opinion before we
had finished our morning's stroll he was singing
as blythe as a grasshopper whistling to his
dogs and telling droll stories and i recollect
that he was particularly facetious that day at
dinner on the subject matrimony and uttered
 a bachelor's confessions
several excellent jokes not to be found in joe
miller that made the future bride blush and
look down but set all the old gentlemen at the
table in a roar and absolutely brought tears into
the general's eyes
english gravity
merrier england 
ancient phrase
there is nothing so rare as for a man to
ride his hobby without molestation i find the
squire has been repeatedly thwarted in his humours
and has suffered a kind well meaning
persecution late by a mr faddy an old gentleman
 some weight at least purse who
has moved into the neighbourhood he is a
worthy manufacturer who having accumulated
a large fortune by steam and spinning jennies
has retired from business and buried himself in
the shades the country
he has taken an old country seat and refitted
it and painted it until it looks not unlike his
own manufactory he has been particularly
 english gravity
careful in mending the walls and hedges and
putting up notices spring guns and men traps
in every part his premises indeed he shows
great jealousy in asserting his territorial rights
having stopped up a foot path that led across
one his fields and given notice in staring
letters that whoever was found trespassing
on these grounds would be prosecuted with
the utmost rigour the law he has brought
into the country with him all his trite maxims
and practical habits business and is
one those intolerably prosing sensible useful
troublesome old gentlemen that go about
wearying and worrying society with plans 
public utility
he is very much disposed to be on good
terms with the squire and is every now and
then calling upon him with some excellent measure
for the good the neighbourhood which
happens to run diametrically opposite to someone
or other the squire's peculiar notions 
but which is too sensible a measure to be
openly opposed
english gravity 
thus he has annoyed him excessively by enforcing
the vagrant laws expelling the gypsies
punishing poachers and endeavouring to suppress
country wakes and rustic games which
he considers great nuisances and causes the
deadly sin idleness i have observed however
that the manufacturer is gradually swelling
into the aristocrat he is losing sight his
origin or fancying that others have lost sight 
it and is attempting in a casual way to shuffle
himself into the pack gentility he has a
great deal to say about the common people 
talks his park his gamekeeper and the necessity
 keeping up the game laws and
makes frequent use the phrase the gentry
 the neighbourhood
he came to the hall lately with a face full 
business to consult with the squire about some
mode putting a stop to the frolicking at the village
on the approaching mayday as it drew idle
people together from all parts the neighbourhood
who spent the day fiddling and drinking
vol 
 english gravity
and dancing instead staying at home to work
for their families as the squire is at the bottom
 these mayday revels it may be supposed
that the suggestions the matteroffact
mr faddy were not received with the best grace
in the world after he was gone the squire could
not contain his indignation at having his poetical
cobwebs invaded by this buzzing blue bottle
fly traffick
in the warmth his feelings he made a
whimsical tirade at the whole race manufacturers
whom he accused being the manners
 the face the country and the destroyers 
rural manners sir said he with emotion
it makes my heart bleed to see all our fine
streams dammed up and bestrode by cotton
mills our valleys smoking with steam engines 
to hear the din the hammer and the loom
scaring away all our rural delights to see our
sturdy peasantry metamorphosed into pin makers
and stocking weavers and merry sherwood
and all the green wood haunts robin
hood covered with manufacturing towns
english gravity 
sir t have stood on the tottering ruins 
dudley castle and looked round with an aching
heart on what were once beautiful vales and
fertile hills now turned into a mere campus
phlegrae the whole country reeking with
coal pits a region fire where furnaces and
smelting houses were vomiting forth flumes and
smoke the people pale and ghastly looked
more like demons than human beings as they
toiled among these noxious exhalations and the
clanking wheels and engines seen through the
murky atmosphere looked like instruments 
torture in this terrestrial pandemonium what
is to become the country with these evils rankling
in its very core sir these manufacturers
will be the ruin the national character they
will not leave materials for a line poetry 
there was something in this in mentation
over public improvements and national industry
that amused me exceedingly but i find that the
squire really grieves over the growing spirit 
trade as destroying the charm life he considers
every new shorthand mode doing things
 english gravity
as an inroad snug sordid method and thinks
that this will soon become a mere matteroffact
world where life will be reduced to a mathematical
calculation conveniences and everything
will be done by steam
he maintains also that the nation has declined
in its free and joyous spirit in proportion
as it has turned its attention to commerce and
manufactures and that in old times when england
was an idler it was also a merrier little
island
indeed the old gentleman adduces a number
 authorities that in some measure bear him
out in his notions if we may judge from the
frequency and extravagance ancient festivals
and merrymakings and the hearty spirit with
which they were kept up by all classes people
the english were a much gayer people than
at present
stow in his survey london gives us many
animating pictures the revels on holidays at
the inns court and the mummers reasonings
and bonfires about the streets london then
english gravity 
resembled the continental cities in its manners
and amusements
the court used to dance after dinner on public
occasions after the coronation dinner 
richard the king the prelates the nobles
the knights and the rest the company danced
in westminster hall to the music the minstrels

the example the court was followed by
the middling classes who spent much the
time in dancing
stow gives us a gay city picture that resembles
the lively groups one may often see in paris
 for he tells us that on holidays after
evening prayers the maidens used to assemble
before the door in sight their masters and
dames and while one played on a timbrel the
others would dance for garlands hanged athwart
the street
 the gayety that prevailed in dress throughout
all ranks society we have abundant testimony
in the rich and fanciful costumes preserved
in books and paintings i have myself says
 english gravity
germaine markham met an ordinary tapster
in his silk stockings garters deep fringed vvith
gold lace the rest his apparel suitable with
cloak lined with velvet nashe too who
wrote in exclaims at the folly and finery
 the nation england the players stage 
gorgeous attire the ape all nations superfluities
the continual masquer in outlandish habiliments

these and many such authorities are quoted
by the squire by way contrasting the former
spirit and vivacity the nation with its present
monotonous habits and appearance john
bull he will say was then a gay cavalier
with a feather in his cap and a sword by his side 
but he is now a plodding citizen in snuff coloured
coat and gaiters
but what in fact has caused such a decline
 gayety in the national character that the
country has almost lost all right to its favourite
old title merry england it may be attributed
in part to the growing hardships the
times and the necessity turning the whole atenglish
gravity 
mention to the means subsistence but england's
gayest customs prevailed at times when
her common people enjoyed comparatively few
 the comforts and conveniences that they doat
present it may be still more attributed to
the universal spirit gain and the calculating
habits business that commerce has introduced 
but i am inclined to attribute it chiefly to the
gradual increase the liberty the subject
arid the general freedom and activity opinion
a free people are apt to be grave and thoughtful
they have high and important matters to
occupy their thoughts they feel it is their
right their interest and their duty to mingle in
public concerns and to watch over the general
welfare
the continual exercise the mind on political
topics gives intense habits thinking and
a more serious and earnest demeanour a nation
becomes less gay but more intellectually
active and vigorous it evinces less play 
the fancy but more power the imagination 
less taste and elegance but more grandeur 
 english gravity
mind less animated vivacity but deeper enthusiasm

if is when men are shut out the regions 
manly thought by a despotic government when
every grave and lofty theme is rendered perilous to
discussion and almost to reflection it is then that
they turn to the safer occupations taste and
amusement trifles rise to importance and occupy
the craving activity intellect
no being is more void care and reflection
than the slave none dances more gayly in his
intervals labour but make him free give
him rights and interests to guard and he becomes
thoughtful and laborious
the french are a gayer people than the english
why partly from temperament perhaps 
but greatly because they have been accustomed
to governments which surrounded the free exercise
 thought with danger and where he only
was safe who shut his eyes and ears to public
events and enjoyed the passing pleasure tie
day within late years they have had more opportunities
 exercising their minds and within
english gravity 
late years the national character has essentially
changed never did the french enjoy such a
degree freedom as they do at this moment 
and at this moment the french are comparatively
a grave people

gipsies
what's that to absolute freedom such as the very beggars have 
to feast and revel here to day and yonder tomorrow next day
where they please and so on still the whole country or kingdom
over there's liberty the birds the air can take no more
jovial crew
since the rencontre with the gipsies which i
have related in a former paper i have observed
several them haunting the purlieus the
hall in spite a positive interdiction the
squire's they are part a gang that has
long kept about this neighbourhood to the great
annoyance the farmers whose poultry yards
often suffer from their nocturnal invasions they
are however in some measure patronized by the
squire who considers the race as belonging to
the good old times which to confess the
private truth seem to have abounded with good
for nothing characters
gipsies 
this roving crew is called starlight tom's
gang from the name its chieftain a notorious
poacher i have heard repeatedly the
misdeeds this minion the moon for
every midnight depredation that takes place in
park or fold or farm yard is laid to his charge
starlight tom in fact answers to his name he
seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be
traced in the mornings by the mischief he has
done he reminds me that fearful personage
in the nursery rhyme 
who goes round the house at night 
none but bloody tom 
who steals all the sheep at night 
none but one by one 
in short starlight tom is the scapegoat 
the neighbourhood but as cunning and adroit
that there is no detecting him old christy
and the gamekeeper have watched many a night
in hopes entrapping him and christy often
patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose
but all in vain it is said that the squire winks
hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feels
gipsies
iris toward the vagabond because his being
very expert at all kinds games a great shot
with the cross bow and the best morris dancer
in the country
the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested
about the skirts his estate on condition
that they do not come about the house the
approaching wedding however has made a kind
 saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension
 all sober rule it has produced a
great sensation throughout the female part the
household not a housemaid but dreams wedding
favours and has a husband running in her
head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies
there is a public footpath leading across one
part the park by which they have free ingress 
and they are continually hovering about the
grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or
getting smuggled in to the young ladies
i believe the oxonian amuses himself very
much by furnishing them with hints in private
and bewildering all the weak brains in the house
with their wonderful revelations the general
gipsies 
certainly was very much astonished by the communications
made to him the other evening by
the gipsy girl he kept a wary silence towards
us on the subject and affected to treat it lightly 
but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his
attentions to lady lillycraft and her dogs
i have seen also phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's
pretty and lovesick niece holding a
long conference with one these old sybil behind
a large tree in the avenue and often looking
round to see that she w r as not observed i
make no doubt that she was endeavouring to get
some favourable augury about the result her
love quarrel with young readymoney as oracles
have always been more consulted on love
affairs than upon any thing else i fear however
that in this instance the response was not
as favourable as usual for i perceived poor
phoebe returning pensively towards the house
her head hanging down her hat in her hand and
the ribband trailing along the ground
at another time as i turned a corner a
terrace at the bottom the garden just by a
 gipsies
clump trees and a large stone urn came
upon a bevy the young girls the family
attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was
at a loss to comprehend the meaning their
blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation
until i saw the red cloak a gipsy vanishing
among the shrubbery a few moments
after i caught sight master simon and the
oxonian stealing along one the walks in the
garden chuckling and laughing at their successful
waggery having evidently put the gipsy
up to the thing and instructed her what to
say
after all there is something strangely pleasing
in these tampering with the future even
where we are convinced the fallacy the
prediction it is singular how willingly the
mind will half deceive itself and with wheat a
degree awe we will listen to these babblers
about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry
with those poor vagabonds that seek to deceive
us into bright hopes and expectations i have
always been something a castle builder and
gipsies 
have found my liveliest pleasures arising from
the illusions which fancy has cast over common
placed realities as i get on in life i find it
more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful
manner and should be thankful to any
prophet however false that should conjure the
clouds which hang over futurity into palaces
and all its doubtful regions into fairy land
the squire who as i have observed has a
private good will toward gipsies has suffered
considerable annoyance on their account not
that they requite his indulgence with ingratitude
for they do not deprecate very flagrantly op his
estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds
occasion loud murmurs in the village
for my own part i have a great toleration
for all kinds vagrant sunshiny existence and
must confess i take a pleasure in observing the
ways gipsies the english who are accustomed
to them from childhood and often suffer
from their petty depredations consider them as
mere nuisances but i have been very much
struck with their peculiarities i like to behold
 gipsies
their clear olive complexions their romantic
black eyes their raven locks their lithe slender
figures and to hear them in low silver
tones dealing forth magnificent promises 
honours and estates world's wealth and
ladies love
their mode life too has something in it
very fanciful and picturesque they are the
denizens nature and maintain a primitive
independence in spite law and gospel 
county gaols and country magistrates it is curious
to see this obstinate adherence to the wild
unsettled habits savage life transmitted from
generation to generation and preserved in the
midst one the most cultivated populous
and systematic countries in the world they
are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people
about them they seem to be like indians
either above or below the ordinary cares and
anxieties mankind heedless power 
honour wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations
 the times the rise or fall grain or
stock or empires they seem to laugh at the toilgipsies

ing fretting world around them and to live according
to the philosophy the old song 
who would ambition shun
and loves to lie i the sun
seeking the food he eats
and please with what he gets
come hither come hither come hither
here shall he see
no enemy
but winter and rough weather
in this way they wander from county to county
keeping about the purlieus villages or in
plenteous neighbourhoods where there are fat
farms and rich country seats their encampments
are generally made in some beautiful spot 
either a green shady nook a road or on the
border a common under a sheltering hedge
or on the skirts a fine spreading wood they
are always to be found lurking about fairs and
races and rustic gatherings wherever there is
pleasure and throng and idleness they are
the oracles milkmaids and simple serving
girls and sometimes have even the honour 
perusing the white hands gentlemen's taught
 
 gipsies
tears when rambling about their father's grounds
they are the bane good housewives and
thrifty farmers and odious in the eyes country
justices but like all vagabond beings they
have something to commend them to the fancy
they are among the last traces in these matteroffact
days the motly population former
times and are whimsically associated in my
mind with fairies and witches robin good fellow
robin hood and the other fantastical personages

mayday customs
happy the age and harmless were the dayes
for then true love and amity was found
when every village did a maypole raise
and whitsunales and maygames did abound 
and all the lusty yonkers in a rout
with merry lasses danced the rod about
then friendship to their banquets bid the guests
and poore men fared the better for their feasts
then lords castles manners towns and towers
rejoic'd when they beheld the farmers flourish
and would come downe unto the summerbowers
to see the countrygallants dance the morris
pasouil's palinodia 
the month april has nearly passed away
and we are fast approaching that poetical day
which was considered in old times as the
boundary that parted the frontiers winter and
summer with all its caprices however i like
the month april i like these laughing and
crying days when sunshine and shade seem to
run in billows over the landscape i like to
 mayday customs
see the sudden shower coming over the meadows
and giving all nature a greener smile and the
bright sunbeams chasing the flying cloud and
turning all its drops into diamonds
i was enjoying a morning the kind in company
with the squire in one the finest parts 
the park
we were skirting a beautiful grove and he
was giving me a kind biographical account
 several his favourite forest trees when we
heard the strokes an axe from the midst a
thick copse the squire paused and listened
with manifest signs uneasiness he turned
his steps in the direction the sound the
strokes grew louder and louder as we advanced 
there was evidently a vigorous arm wielding the
axe the squire quickened his pace but in
vain a loud crack and a succeeding crash told
that the mischief had been done and some child
 the forest laid low when we came to the
place we found master simon and several others
standing about a tall and beautifully straight
young larch which had just been felled
mayday customs 
the squire though a man most harmonious
disposition was completely put out 
tune by this circumstance he felt like a monarch
witnessing the murder one his liege
subjects and demanded with some asperity the
meaning the outrage it turned out to be an
affair master simon's who had selected the
tree from its height and straightness for a maypole
 the old one which stood on the village
green being unfit for farther service
if any thing could have soothed the ire my
worthy host it would have been the reflection
that his tree had fallen in a good cause and i
saw that there was a great struggle between his
fondness for his groves and his devotion to may
day
he could not contemplate the prostrate tree
however without indulging in lamentation and
making a kind funeral eulogy and he forbad
that any tree should thenceforward be cut down
ort his estate without a warrant from himself
being determined he said to hold the sovereign
power life and death in his own hands
 mayday customs
this mention the maypole struck my attention
and i inquired whether the old customs
connected with it were still kept up with any
spirit in this part the country
the squire shook his head mournfully and i
found i had touched on one his tender points
for he grew quite melancholy in bewailing the
total decline old mayday though it is regularly
celebrated in the neighbouring village
yet it has been merely resuscitated by his countenance
and is kept up in a forced state existence
at his expense he meets with continual
discouragements and finds great difficulty in
getting the country bumpkins to play their parts
tolerably
he manages to have every year a queen 
the may but as to robin hood friar tuck
the dragon the hobby horse and all the other
mostly crew that used to enliven the day with
their mummery he has not ventured to introduce
them
still i look forward with some interest to the
promised shadow old mayday even though
mayday customs 
it be but a shadow and i feel more and more
pleased with this whimsical yet harmless hobby
 my host which is surrounding him with agreeable
associations and making a little world 
poetry about him
brought up as i have been in a new country
i may appreciate too highly the faint vestiges 
ancient customs which now and then meet
with and the interest i express in them may
provoke a smile from those who are negligently
suffering them to pass away but with whatever
indifference they may be regarded by those
to the manner born yet in my mind the
lingering flavour them imparts a charm to
rustic life which nothing else could readily supr
shall never forget the delight i felt on first
seeing a maypole it was on the banks the
dee close by the picturesque old bridge that
stretches across that river from the quaint little
city chester had already been carried
back into former days by the antiquities that
venerable place the examination which is
 mayday customs
equal to turning over the pages a black letter
volume or gazing on the pictures in froissart
the maypole on the margin that poetic
stream completed the illusion my fancy adorned
it with wreaths flowers and peopled the
green bank with all the dancing revelry may
day the mere sight the maypole gave a
glow to my feelings and spread a charm over
the country for th rest the day and as i
traversed a part the fair plain cheshire
and the beautiful borders wales and looked
from among swelling hills down a long green
valley through which the deva wound its
wizard stream my imagination turned all into
a perfect arcadia
whether it be owing to such poetical associations
early instilled into my mind or whether
there is as it were a sympathetic revival and
budding forth the feelings at this season certain
it is that i always experience wherever i
may be placed a delightful expansion the heart
at the return may it is said that birds about
this time will become restless in their cages as if
mayday customs 
instinct with the season conscious the revelry
that is going on in the groves and impatient to
break from their bondage and join in the jubilee
 the year
in like manner i have felt myself excited even
in the midst the metropolis when the windows
which had been churlishly closed all winter
were again thrown open to receive the balmy
breath may when the sweets the country
were breathed into the town and flowers
were cried about the streets
i have considered the treasure flowers thus
poured in as so many missives from nature inviting
us forth to enjoy the virgin beauty the
year before its freshness is exhaled by the
heats sunny summer y
one can readily imagine what a gay scene it
must have been in jolly old london on a may
day in former times when the doors were decorated
with flowering branches when every hat
was decked with hawthorn and robin hood
friar tuck maid marian the morris dancers
and all the other fantastic masks and revellers
vol 
 mayday customs
were performing their antics about the maypole
in every part the city
i am not a bigoted admirer old times and
old customs rrterely because their antiquity
but while i rejoice in the decline many 
the rude usages and coarse amusements former
days i cannot but regret that this innocent
and fanciful festival has fallen into disuse it
seemed appropriate to this verdant and pastoral
country and calculated to light up the too pervading
gravity the nation i value every
custom that tends to infuse poetical feeling into
the common people and to sweeten and soften
the rudeness rustic manners without destroying
their simplicity indeed it is to the decline
 this happy simplicity that the decline this
custom may be traced and the rural dance on
the green and the homely mayday pageant
have gradually disappeared in proportion as the
peasantry have become expensive and artificial
in their pleasures and too knowing for simple
enjoyment
mayday customs 
some attempts the squire informs me have
been made late years by men both taste
and learning to rally back the popular feeling
to these standards primitive simplicity but
the time has gone by the feeling has become
chilled by habits gain and traffick the country
apes the manners and amusements the
town and little is heard mayday at present
excepting from the lamentations authors who
sigh after it from among the brick walls the
city
for for the hobby horse is forgot

village worthies
nay i tell you i am so well beloved in our town that not the
worst dog in the street will hurt my little finger
collier croydon
as the neighbouring village is one those
outoftheway but gossipping little places
where a small matter makes a great stir it is
not to be supposed that the approach a festival
like that mayday can be regarded with
indifference especially since it is made a matter
 such moment by the great folks at the hall
master simon who is the faithful factotum 
the worthy squire and jumps with his humour
in every thing is frequent just now in his visits
to the village to give directions for the impending
fete and as i have taken the liberty occasionally
 accompanying him i have been
 village worthies 
enabled to get some insight into the characters
and internal politics this very sagacious
little community
master simon is in fact the caesar the village
it is true the squire is the protecting
power but his factotum is the active and busy
agent he intermeddle in all its concerns
is acquainted with all the inhabitants and their
domestic history gives counsel to the old folks
in their business matters and the young folks
in their love affairs and enjoys the proud satisfaction
 being a great mart in a little world
he is the dispenser too the squire's charity
which is bounteous and to do master simon
justice he performs this part his functions
with great alacrity indeed i have been entertained
with the mixture bustle importance
and kind heartiness which he displays he
is too vivacious a temperament to comfort
the afflicted by sitting down moping and whining
and blowing noses in concert but goes
whisking about like a sparrow chirping consolation
into every hole and corner the village
 village worthies
i have seen an old woman in a red cloak hold
him for half an hour together with some long
phthisical tale distress to which master simon
listened with many a bob the head
smack his whip and other symptoms impatience
 though he afterwards made a most
faithful and circumstantial report the case to
the squire i have watched him too during
one his pop visits into the cottage a superannuated
villager who is a pensioner the
squire's where he fidgeted about the room
without sitting down made many excellent offhand
reflections with the old invalid who was
propped up in his chair about the shortness 
life the certainty death and the necessity 
preparing for that awful change quoted
several texts scripture very incorrectly but
much to the edification the cottager's wife 
and on coming out pinched the daughter's rosy
cheek and wondered what was in the young
men that such a pretty face did not get a husband

village worthies 
he has also his cabinet councillors in the
village with whom he is very busy just now
preparing for the mayday ceremonies among
these is the village tailor a palefaced fellow that
plays the clarion in the church choir and being
a great musical genius has frequent meetings 
the band at his house where they make night
hideous by their concerts he is in consequence
high in favour with master simon and
through his influence has the making or rather
marring all the liveries the hall which generally
look as though they had been cut out by
one those scientific tailors the flying island
 laputa who took measure their customers
with a quadrant the tailor in fact might rise
to be one the monied men the village if he
were not rather too prone to gossip and keep
holidays and give concerts and blow all his
substance real and personal through his clarion
 which literally keeps him poor both in
body and estate he has for the present thrown
by all his regular work and suffered the breeches
 the village to go unmade and unmended
 village worthies
while he is occupied in making garlands parti
coloured rags in imitation flowers for the
decoration the maypole
another master simon's councillors is the
apothecary a short and rather fat man with a
pair prominent eyes that diverge like those 
a lobster he is the village wise man very
sententious and full profound remarks on
shallow subjects master simon often quotes
his sayings and mentions him as rather an extraordinary
man and even consults him occasionally
in desperate cases the dogs and horses
indeed he seems to have been overwhelmed by
the apothecary's philosophy which is exactly
one observation deep consisting indisputable
maxims such as may be gathered from the mottoes
 tobacco boxes i had a specimen his
philosophy in my very first conversation with
him in the course which he observed with
great solemnity and emphasis that man is a
compound wisdom and folly upon which
master simon who had hold my arm pressed
very hard upon it and whispered in my ear
that's a devilish shrewd remark 
the schoolmaster
there will no moss stick to the stone sisyphus no grasse hang
on the heels mercury no butter cleave on the bread a traveller
for as the eagle at every flight loseth a feather which maketh
her bauld in her age so the traveller in every country loseth some
fleece which maketh him a beggar in his youth by buying that for a
pound which he cannot sell again for a penny repentance
lilly's euphues
among the worthies the village that enjoy
the peculiar confidence master simon is one
who has struck my fancy so much that i have
thought him worthy a separate notice it is
slingsbyby the schoolmaster a thin elderly man
rather threadbare and slovenly somewhat indolent
in manner and with an easy good humoured
look not often met with in his craft i have
been interested in his favour by a few anecdotes
which i have picked up concerning him
he is a native the village and was a convol
 
 the schoolmaster
temporary and playmate ready money jack's
in the days their boyhood indeed they carried
on a kind league mutual good offices
slingsbyby was rather puny and withall somewhat
 a coward but very apt at his learning jack
on the contrary was a bullyboy out doors
but a sad laggard at his books slingsbyby helped
jack therefore to all his lessons and jack fought
all slingsbyby's battles and they were inseparable
friends this mutual kindness continued even
after they left the school notwithstanding the
dissimilarity their characters jack took to
ploughing and reaping and prepared himself to
till his paternal acres while the other loitered
negligently on in the path learning until he
penetrated even into the confines latin and
mathematics in an unlucky hour however
he took to reading voyages and travels and was
smitten with a desire to see the world this
desire increased upon him as he grew up so
early one bright sunny morning he put all his
effects in a knapsack slung it on his back took
staff in hand and called in his way to take leave
the schoolmaster 
 his early schoolmate jack was just going
out with the plough the friends shook hands
over the farm house gate jack drove his team
afield and slingsbyby whistled over the hills
and far away and sallied forth gayly to seek
his fortune
years and years passed by and young tom
slingsbyby was forgotten when one mellow sunday
afternoon in autumn a thin man somewhat
advanced in life with a coat out at elbows
a pair old nankeen gaiters and a few things
tied in a handkerchief and slung on the 
a stick was seen loitering through the village
he appeared to regard several houses attentively
to peer into the windows that were open
to eye the villagers wistfully as they returned
from church and then to pass some time in the
churchyard reading the tombstones
at length he found his way to the farm house
 ready money jack but paused ere he attempted
the wicket contemplating the picture
 substantial independence before him in
the porch the house sat ready money jack
 the schoolmaster
in his sunday dress with his hat upon his head
his pipe in his mouth and his tankard before
him the monarch all he surveyed beside
him lay his fat house dog the varied sounds
 poultry were heard from the well stocked
farm yard the bees hummed from their hives in
the garden the cattle lowed in the rich meadow 
while the crammed barns and ample stacks bore
proof an abundant harvest
the stranger opened the gate and advanced
dubiously toward the house the mastiff growled
at the sight him but was immediately
silenced by his master who taking his pipe
from his mouth awaited with inquiring aspect
the address this equivocal personage the
stranger eyed old jack for a moment so portly
in his dimensions and decked out in gorgeous
apparel then cast a glance upon his own threadbare
and starveling condition and the scanty
bundle which he held in his hand then giving
his shrunk waistcoat a twitch to make it meet
his receding waistband and casting another
look half sad half humorous at the sturdy
the schoolmaster 
yeoman i suppose said he mr gibbets
you have forgot old times and old playmates
the latter gazed at him with scrutinizing
look but acknowledged that he had no recollection
 him 
like enough like enough said the
stranger every body seems to have forgotten
poor slingsbyby
why no sure it can't be tom slingsbyby 
yes but it is though replied the other
shaking his head
ready money jack was on his feet in a
twinkling thrust out his hand gave his ancient
crony the gripe a giant and slapping the
other hand on a bench sit down there cried
he tom slingsbyby 
a long conversation ensued about old times
while slingsbyby was regaled with the best cheer
that the farm house afforded for he was hungry
as well as wayworn and had the keen appetite
 a poor pedestrian the early playmates
then talked over their lives and adventures
jack had but little to relate and was never good
 the schoolmaster
at a long story a prosperous life passed at
home has little incident for narration it is only
poor devils that are tossed about the world that
are the true heroes story jack had stuck by
the paternal farm followed tfce same plough that
his forefathers had driven and had waxed richer
and richer as he grew older as to tom slingsbyby
he was an exemplification the old proverb
a rolling stone gathers no moss he had
sought his fortune about the world without ever
finding it being a thing oftener found at home
than abroad he had been in all kinds situations
 had learnt a dozen different modes making
a living but had found his way back to
his native village rather poorer than when he
left it his knapsack having dwindled down into
a scanty bundle
as luck would have it the squire was passing
by the farm house that very evening and
called there as is often his custom he found
the two schoolmates still gossiping in the porch
and according to the good old scottish song
taking a cup kindness yet for auld lang
the schoolmaster 
syne the squire was struck by the contrast
in appearance and fortunes these early
playmates ready money jack seated in lordly
state surrounded by the good things this
life with golden guineas hanging to his very
watch chain and the poor pilgrim slingsbyby
thin as a weasel with all his worldly effects
his bundle hat and walking staff lying on the
ground beside him
the good squire's heart warmed towards the
cosmopolite for he is a little prone to like such
half vagrant kind characters he cast about
in his mind how he should contrive once more to
anchor slingsbyby in his native village honest
jack had already offered him a present shelter
under his roof in spite the hints and winks
and half remonstrances the shrewd dame gibbets
 but how to provide for his permanent
maintenance was the question luckily the
squire bethought himself that the village school
was without a teacher a little farther conversation
convinced him that slingsbyby was
as fit for that as for any thing else and
 the schoolmaster
in a day or two he was seen swaying the rod 
empire in the very schoolhouse where he had
often been horsed in the days his boyhood
here he has remained for several years and
being honoured by the countenance the squire
and the fast friendship mr tibbets he has
grown into much importance and consideration
in the village i am v told however that he still
shows now and then a degree restlessness
and a disposition to rove abroad again and see a
little more the world an inclination which
seems particularly to haunt him about springtime
there is nothing so difficult to conquer
as the vagrant humour when once it has been
fully indulged
since i have heard these anecdotes poor
slingsbyby i have more than once mused upon
the picture presented by him and his schoolmate
ready money jack on their coming together
again after so long a separation it is difficult
to determine between lots in life where each is
attended with its peculiar discontents he who
never leaves his home repines at his monotonous
the schoolmaster 
existence and envies the traveller whose life is a
constant tissue wonder and adventure while
he who is tossed about the world looks back with
many a sigh on the safe and quiet shore which
he has abandoned i cannot help thinking
however that the man that stays at home and
cultivates the comforts and pleasures daily springing
up around him stands the best chance for
happiness there is nothing so fascinating to a
young mind as the idea travelling and there
is very witchcraft in the old phrase found in
every nursery tale going to seek one's fortune
a continual change place and change
 object promises a continual succession adventure
and gratification curiosity but there
is a limit to all our enjoyments and every desire
bears its death in its very gratification curiosity
languishes under repeated stimulants
novelties cease to excite surprise until at length
we cannot wonder even at a miracle he who
has sallied forth into the world like poor slingsbyby
full sunny anticipations finds too soon
how different the distant scene becomes when
vol 
 the schoolmaster
visited the smooth place roughens as he approaches
 the wild place becomes tame and barren
 the fairy tints that beguiled him on still fly
to the distant hill or gather upon the land he
has left behind and every part the landscape is
greener than the spot he stands on
the school
but to come down from great men and higher matters to my little
children and poor school house again i will god willing go forward
orderly as i purposed to instruct children and young men both
for learning and manners
roger ascham
having given the reader a slight sketch 
the village schoolmaster he may be curious to
learn something concerning his school as the
squire takes much interest in the'education the
neighbouring children he put into the hands 
the teacher on first installing him in office a
copy roger ascham's schoolmaster and
advised him moreover to con over that portion
 old pelham which treats the duty 
masters and which condemns the favourite
method making boys wise by flagellation
he exhorted slingsbyby not to break down or
 the school
depress the free spirit the boys by harshness
and slavish fear but to lead them freely and
joyously on in the path knowledge making
it pleasant and desirable in their eyes he
wished to see the youth trained up in the manners
and habitudes the peasantry the good
old times and thus to lay a foundation for the
accomplishment his favourite object the revival
 old english customs and character
he recommended that all the ancient holidays
should be observed and that the sports the
boys in their hours play should be regulated
according to the standard authorities laid down
in struts a copy whose invaluable work
decorated with plates was deposited in the
school house above all he exhorted the pedagogue
to abstain from the use birch an instrument
 instruction which the good squire
regards with abhorrence as fit only for the
coercion brute natures that cannot be reasoned
with
mr slingsbyby has followed the squire's instructions
to the best his disposition and abi
the school 
cities he never flogs the boys because he is too
easy goodhumoured a creature to inflict pain
on a worm he is bountiful in holidays because
he loves holidays himself and has a sympathy
with the urchins impatience confinement
from having divers times experienced its
irksomeness during the time that he was seeing
the world
as to sports and pastimes the boys are faithfully
exercised in all that are on record quoits
races prison bars tipcat trapball bandyball
wrestling leaping and what not the only
misfortune is that having banished the birch
honest slingsbyby has not studied roger ascham
sufficiently to find out a substitute or rather he
has not the management in his nature to apply
one his school therefore though one the
happiest is one the most unruly in the country
 and never was a pedagogue more liked or
less heeded by his disciples than slingsbyby
he has lately taken a coadjutor worthy 
himself being another stray sheep that has returned
to the village fold this is no other than
 the school
the son the musical tailor who had bestowed
some cost upon his education hoping to see him
one day arrive at the dignity an exciseman or
at least a parish clerk the lad grew up
however as idle and musical as his father and
being captivated by the drum and fife a recruiting
party he followed them off to the army
he returned not long since out money and
out at the elbows the prodigal son the village
he remained for some time lounging
about the place in a half tattered soldier's dress
with a foraging cap on one side his head
jerking stones across the brook or loitering about
the tavern door a burthen to his father and regarded
with great coldness by all the warm
householders
something however drew honest slingsbyby
towards the youth it might be the kindness
he bore to his father who is one the schoolmaster's
great cronies it might be that secret
sympathy which draws men vagrant propensities
towards each other for there is something
truly magnetic in the vagabond feeling or it
the school 
might be that he remembered the time when he
himself had come back like this youngster a
wreck to his native place at any rate whatever
the motive slingsbyby drew towards the
youth they had many conversations in the
village taproom about foreign parts and the
various scenes and places they had witnessed
during their wayfaring about the world the
more slingsbyby talked with him the more he
found him to his taste and finding him almost
as learned as himself he forthwith engaged
him as an assistant or usher in the school
under such admirable tuition the school as
may be supposed flourishes apace and if the
scholars do not become versed in all the holyday
accomplishments the good old times to the
squire's heart's content it will not be the fault
 their teachers the prodigal son has become
almost as popular among the boys as the pedagogue
himself his instructions are not limited
to the school hours and having inherited the
musical taste and talents his father he has
bitten the whole school with the mania he
so the school
is a great hand at beating a drum which is often
heard rumbling from the rear the school house
he is teaching half the boys the village also
to play the fife and the pandean pipes and they
weary the whole neighbourhood with their
vague pipings as they sit perched on stiles or
loitering about the barn doors in the evenings
among the other exercises the school also
he has introduced the ancient art archery
one the squire's favourite themes with
such success that the whispers roam in truant
bands about the neighbourhood practising with
their bows and arrows upon the birds the air
and the beasts the field in a word so completely
are the ancient english customs and habits
cultivated at this school that i should not be
surprised if the squire should live to see one 
his poetic visions realized and a brood reared up
worthy successors to robin hood and his merry
gang outlaws
popular superstitions
farewell rewards and fairies
good housewives now may say 
for now fowls sluts in dairies
do fare as well as they 
and though they sweep their hearth's no lesse
than maids were wont to doe
yet who late for cleanliness
finds six pence in her shore 
bishop cokjbet
i have mentioned the squire's fondness for
the marvellous and this predilection for legends
and romances his library contains a curious
collection old works this kind which bear
evident marks having been much read in
his great love for all that is antiquated he cherishes
popular superstitions and listens with very
grave attention to every tale however strange 
so that through his countenance the household
and indeed the whole neighbourhood is well
vol 
 popular superstitions
stocked with wonderful stories and if ever a
doubt is expressed anyone them the narrator
will generally observe that the squire
thinks there's something in it
the hall course comes in for its share the
common people having always a propensity to
furnish a great superannuated building the
kind with supernatural inhabitants the gloomy
galleries such old family mansions the stately
chambers adorned with grotesque carvings and
faded paintings the sounds that vaguely echo
about them the moaning the wind the cries
 rooks and ravens from the trees and chimney
tops all produce a state mind favourable to
superstitious fancies
in one chamber the hall just opposite a
door which opens upon a dusky passage there
is a full length portrait a warrior in armour 
when on suddenly turning into this passage
i have caught a sight the portrait thrown into
strong relief by the dark panelling against
which it hangs i have more than once been
startled as though it were a figure advancing
popular superstitions 
towards me to superstitious minds therefore
predisposed by the strange and melancholy stories
that are often connected with family paintings
it needs but little stretch fancy on a
moonlight night or by the flickering light a
candle to set the old pictures on the walls in
motion sweeping in their robes and trains about
the galleries
to tell the truth the squire confesses that
he used to take a pleasure in his younger days
in setting marvellous stories afloat and connecting
them with the lonely and peculiar places 
the neighbourhood whenever he read any
legend a striking nature he endeavoured to
transplant it and give it a local habitation
among the scenes his boyhood many 
these stories took root and he says he is often
amused with the odd shapes in which they will
come back to him in some old woman's narrative
after they have been circulating for years
among the peasantry and undergoing rustic additions
and amendments among these may
doubtless be numbered that the crusader's
 popular superstitions
ghost which i have mentioned in the account 
my christmas visit and another about the
hardriding squire yore the family nimrod
who is sometimes heard on stormy winter
nights galloping with hound and horn over a
wild moor a few miles distant from the hall
this i apprehend to have had its origin in the
famous story the wild huntsman the favourite
goblin in german tales though by thei

bye as i was talking on the subject with master
simon the other evening in the dark avenue he
hinted that he had himself once or twice heard
strange sounds at night very like a pack 
hounds in cry and that once as he was returning
rather late from a hunting dinner he had
seen a strange figure galloping along this same
moor but as he was riding rather fast at the
time and in a hurry to get home he did not
stop to ascertain what it was
popular superstitions are fast fading away in
england owing to the general diffusion knowledge
and the bustling intercourse kept up
throughout the country still they have their
popular superstitions 
strong holds and lingering places and a retired
neighbourhood like this is apt to be one them
the parson tells me that he meets with many traditional
beliefs and notions among the common
people which he has been able to draw from them
in the course familiar conversation though they
are rather shy avowing them to strangers and
particularly to the gentry who are apt to
laugh at them he says there are several his
old parishioners who remember when the village
had its barguest or bar ghost a spirit supposed
to belong to a town or village and to predict any
impending misfortune by midnight shrieks and
failings the last time it was heard was just
before the death mr drawbridge's father
who was much beloved throughout the neighbourhood
 though there are not wanting some
obstinate unbelievers who insist that it was nothing
but the howling a watch dog
i have been greatly delighted however at
meeting with some traces my old favourite
robin good fellow though under a different
appellation from any those by which i have
 popular superstitions
heretofore heard him called the parson assures
me that many the peasantry believe in
household goblins called dobbies which live
about particular farms and houses in the same
way that robin good fellow did old sometimes
they haunt the barns and outhouses and
now and then will assist the farmer wonderfully
by getting in all his hay or corn in a single night
in general however they prefer to live within
doors and are fond keeping about the great
hearths and basking at night after the family
have gone to bed by the glowing embers when
put into particular good humour by the warmth
 their lodgings and the tidiness the housemaids
they will overcome their natural laziness
arid do a vast deal household work before
morning churning the cream brewing the
beer or spinning all the good dame's flax all
this is precisely the conduct robin good
fellow described so charmingly by milton 
tells how the drudging goblin sweat
to earn his creambowl duly set
when in one night ere glimpse morn
his shadowy flail had threshed the con
popular superstitions 
that ten daylabourers could not 
then lays him down the lubberfiend
and stretched out all the chimney's length
basks at the fire his hairy strength
and cropfull out door he flings
ere the first cock his matin rings
but beside these household dobbies there are
others a more gloomy and unsocial nature 
that keep about lonely barns at a distance from
any dwelling house or about ruins and old
bridges these are full mischievous and
often malignant tricks and are fond playing
pranks upon benighted travellers there
is a story among the old people one that
haunted a ruined mill just by a bridge that
crosses a small stream how that late one night
as a traveller was passing on horseback the
dobbin jumped up behind him and grasped him
so close round the body that he had no power
to help himself but expected to be squeezed to
death luckily his heels were loose with which
he plied the sides his steed and was carried
with the wonderful instinct a traveller's
horse straight to the village inn had the inn
 popular superstitions
been at any greater distance there is no doubt
but he would have been strangled to death as
it was the good people were a long time in
bringing him to his senses and it was remarked
that the first sign he showed returning consciousness
was to call for a bottom brandy
the only instance one the household
dobbies that the parson has met with is one
that was said to keep about the old farm house
 ready money jack it has long been traditional
i am told that one these good natured
goblins is attached to the tibbets family and
came with them when they moved into this part
 the country for it is remarked that they keep
with certain families and follow them wherever
they remove there is a large old fashioned
fireplace in the farm house which affords fine
quarters for a chimney corner sprite the kind
that likes to lie warm especially as ready
money jack keeps up rousing fires in the wintertime
the old people the village recollect
many stories that were told about this goblin in
popular superstitions 
their young days it was thought to have
brought good luck to the house and to be the
reason why the tibbets were always beforehand
in the world why their farm was always
in better order their hay got in sooner 
and their corn better stacked than that their
neighbours the present mrs tibbets at the
time her courtship had a number these
stones told her by the country gossips and when
married was a little fearful about living in a
house where such a hobgoblin was said to haunt
jack however who has always treated this story
with great contempt assured her that there was
no spirit kept about his house that he could not
at any time lay in the red sea with one flourish
 his cudgel still his wife has never got completely
over her notions on the subject she
has had a horseshoe nailed on the threshold
and keeps a branch country or mountain ash
with its red berries suspended from one the
great beams in the parlour sure protections from
all evil spirits

popular superstitions
these stories however as i before observed
are fast fading away and in another generation
or two will probably be completely forgotten
there is something however about these rural
superstitions that is extremely pleasing to the
imagination i allude to those concerning the
good humoured race household demons and
indeed to the whole fairy mythology the
english have given an inexpressible charm to
these superstitions by the manner in which they
have associated them with whatever is most
homefelt and delightful in rustic life or refreshing
and beautiful in nature i do not know a
more fascinating race beings than these little
fabled people that haunted the southern sides 
hills and mountains lurked in flowers and about
fountain heads glided through keyhole into ancient
halls watched over farm houses and dairies 
danced on the green by summer moonlight and on
the kitchen hearth in winter they seem to me to
accord with the nature english housekeeping
and english scenery i always have them in mind
when i see a fine old english mansion with its
popular superstitions 
wide hall and spacious kitchen or a venerable
farm house in which there is so much fireside
comfort and good housewifery there was something
 national character in their love order
and cleanliness in the vigilance with which
they watched over the economy the kitchen
and the functions the servants munificently
rewarding with silver sixpence in shoe the tidy
housemaid but venting their direful wrath in
midnight bobs and pinches upon the sluttish
dairy maid i think i can trace the good effects
 this ancient fairy sway over household concerns
in the care that prevails to the present day
among english housemaids to put their kitchens
in order before they go to bed
i have said too that these fairy superstitions
seemed to me to accord with the nature english
scenery they suit these small landscapes
which are divided by honeysuckled hedges into
sheltered fields and meadows where the grass
is mingled with daisies butter cups and harebells
when i first found myself among english
scenery i was continually reminded the
popular superstitions
sweet pastoral images which distinguish their
fairy mythology and when for the first time a
circle in the grass was pointed out to me as one
 the rings where they were formerly supposed
to have held their moonlight revels it seemed
for a moment as if fairy land were no longer
a fable
browne in his britannia's pastorals gives a
picture the kind scenery to which i allude
a pleasant mead
where fairies often did their measures tread
which in the meadows make such circles green
as if with garlands it had crowned been
within one these rounds was to be seen
a hillock rise where oft the fairy queen
at twilight sat
and there is another picture the same in a
poem ascribed to ben jonson
i
by wells and rills in meadows green
we nightly dance our heyday guise
and to our fairy king and queen
we chaunt our moonlight mistresses
indeed it seems to me that the older british
poets with that true feeling for nature which
distinguishes them have closely adhered to the
popular superstitions s
simple and familiar imagery which they found
in these popular superstitions and have thus
given to their fairy mythology those continual
allusions to the farm house and the dairy the
green meadow and the fountain head that fill
our minds with the delightful associations 
rural life it is curious to observe how the
most beautiful fictions have their origin among
the rude and ignorant there is an indescribable
charm about the illusions with which chimerical
ignorance once clothed every subject
these twilight views nature are often more
captivating than any which are revealed by the
rays enlightened philosophy the most accomplished
and poetical minds therefore have
been fain to search back into these accidental
conceptions what are termed barbarous ages
and to draw from thence their finest imagery
and machinery if we look through our most
admired poets we shall find that their minds
have been impregnated by these popular fancies
 and that those have succeeded best who
have adhered closest to the simplicity their
 popular superstitions
rustic originals such is the case with shakspeare
in his midsummer's night's dream
which so minutely describes the employments
and amusements fairies and embodies all
the notions concerning them which were current
among the vulgar
it is thus that poetry in england has
echoed back every rustic note softened into
perfect melody it is thus that it has spread its
charms over every day life displacing nothing 
taking things as it found them but tinting them
up with its own magical hues until every green
hill and fountain head every fresh meadow
nay every humble flower is full song and
story
i am dwelling too long perhaps upon a threadbare
subject yet it brings up with it a thousand
delicious recollections those happy days 
childhood when the imperfect knowledge i have
since obtained had not yet dawned upon my
mind and when a fairy tale was true history tome
i have often been so transported by the
pleasure these recollections as almost to wish
popular superstitions 
that i had been born in the days when the fictions
 poetry were believed even now i cannot
look upon these fanciful creations ignorance
and credulity without a lurking regret that
they have all passed away the experience 
my early days tells me that they were sources 
exquisite delight and i sometimes question
whether the naturalist who can dissect the flowers
 the field receives half the pleasure from contemplating
them that he did who considered
them the abodes elves and fairies i feel convinced
that the true interests and solid happiness
 man are promoted by the advancement 
truth yet i cannot but mourn over the pleasant
errors which it has trampled down in its progress
the fawns and sylphs the household sprite the
moonlight revel oberon queen mab and the
delicious realms fairy land all vanish before the
light true philosophy but who does not sometimes
turn with distaste from the cold realities

in an old play entitled the maids metamorphosis
there is a scene resembling in many
respects nick bottom's dialogue with the fairies
in midsummer's night's dream the edition
that i saw was printed in and was bound
up in the same volume with an edition midsummer's
night's dream published in the same
year which these plays was written first

in one my visits to the village with master
simon he proposed that we should stop at the
inn which he wanted to show me as a specimen
 a real country inn the head quarters village
gossip i had remarked it before in my
perambulations about the place it has a deep
old fashioned porch leading into a large hall
which serves for a tap room and traveller's room
having a wide fireplace with highbacked settles
on each side where the wise men the
village gossip over their ale and hold their sessions
during the long winter evenings the
a village politician 
landlord is an easy indolent fellow shaped a little
like one his own beer barrels who is apt
to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on
one side and his hands in his pockets whilst his
wife and daughter attend to customers his
wife however is fully competent to manage the
establishment and indeed from long habitude
rules over all the frequenters the tap room as
completely as if they were her dependents instead
 her patrons not a veteran ale bibber
but pays homage to her having no doubt been
often in her arrears i have already hinted that
she is on very good terms with ready money
jack he was a sweetheart her's in early
life and has always countenanced the tavern on
her account indeed he is quite the cock 
the walk at the tap room
as we approached the inn we heard someone
talk with great volubility and distinguished
the ominous words taxes poor's rates
and agricultural distress it proved to be a
thin loquacious fellow who had got the landlord
pinned up in one corner the porch with his
 a village politician
hands in his pockets as usual listening with an
air the most vacant acquiescence
the sight seemed to have a curious effect on
master simon as he squeezed my arm and altering
his course sheered wide the porch as
though he had not had any idea entering
this evident evasion made me notice the orator
more particularly he was meagre but active
in his make with a long pale bilious face a
black beard so ill shaven as to bloody his shirtcollar
a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at
the sides into a most pragmatical shape he
had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be
commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction
 mine host at the sight master
simon the landlord was a little flurried and
began to rub his hands edge away from his corner
and make several profound publican bows 
while the orator took no other notice my companion
than to talk rather louder than before
and with as i thought something an air 
defiance master simon however as i have
before said sheered off from the porch and passa
village politician 
ed on pressing my arm within his and whispering
as we got by in a tone awe and horror
 that's a radical he reads cobbett 
i endeavoured to get a more particular account
 him from my companion but he
seemed unwilling even to talk about him assuring
me only in general terms that he was
a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded
trick talking and was apt to bother one
about the national debt and such nonsense 
from which i suspected that master simon had
been rendered wary him by some accidental
encounter on the field argument for these
radicals are continually roving about in quest 
wordy warfare and never so happy as when
they can tilt a gentleman logician out his
saddle
on subsequent inquiry my suspicions have
been confirmed i find the radical has but recently
found his way into the village where he
threatens to commit fearful devastation with his
doctrines he has already made two or three
complete converts or new lights has shaken the
 a village politician
faith several others and has grievously puzzled
the brains many the oldest villagers
who had never thought about politics or scarce
any thing else during their whole lives
he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness
 mind and body worrying about with
newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which
he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has
shocked several the staunchest villagers by
talking lightly the squire and his family and
hinting it would be better the park should be
cut up into small farms and kitchen gardens or
feed good mutton instead worthless deer
he is a great thorn in the side the squire
who is sadly afraid he will introduce politics into
the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking
community he is a still greater grievance
to master simon who has hitherto been able to
sway the political opinions the place without
much cost learning or logic but has been
very much puzzled late to weed out the doubts
and heresies already sown by this champion 
reform indeed the latter has taken complete
a village politician 
command at the tap room the tavern not so
much because he has convinced as because he
has out talked all the old established oracles
the apothecary with all his philosophy has
been as naught before him he has convinced
and converted the landlord at least a dozen times
who however is liable to be convinced and converted
the other way by the next person with
whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent
antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently
loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king
master simon and the squire she now and
then comes out upon the reformer with all the
the fierceness a cata mountain and does not
spare her own soft headed husband for listening
to what she terms such low lived politics
what makes the good woman the more violent
is the perfect coolness with which the radical
listens to her attacks drawing his face up into
a provoking supercilious smile and when she
has talked herself out breath quietly asking
her for a taste her homebrewed
the only person that is in any way a match

for this redoubtable politician is ready money
jack tibbets who maintains his stand in the
tap room in defiance the radical and all his
works jack is one the most loyal men in the
country without being able to reason about the
matter he has that admirable quality for a
tough arguer also that he never knows when
he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims
which he advances on all occasions and though
his antagonist may overturn them never so often
yet he always brings them anew to the field
he is like the robber in ariosto who though
his head might be cut off half a hundred times
yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling
and returned as sound a man as ever to the
charge
whatever does not square with jack's simple
and obvious creed he sets down for french
politics for notwithstanding the peace he
cannot be persuaded the french are not still
laying plots to ruin the nation and get hold the
bank england the radical attempted to
overwhelm him one day by a long passage from
a village politician 
 
a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes
in newspapers in reply he gave him
one the stanzas which he has by heart from
his favourite and indeed only author old tusser
and which he calls his golden rules 
leave princes affairs descanted on
and tend to such doings as stand thee upon
fear god and offend not the king nor his laws
and keep thyself out the magistrate's claws
when tibbets had pronounced this with great
emphasis he pulled out a wellfilled leathern
purse took out a handful gold and silver
paid his score at the bar with great punctuality
returned his money piece by piece into his
purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned
up and then giving his cudgel a stout
thump upon the floor and bidding the radical
 good morning sir with the tone 
a man who conceives he has completely done
for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity
out the house two or three jack's
admirers who were present and were afraid
to take the field themselves looked upon this

as a perfect triumph and winked at each other

the squire has lately received another shock
in the saddle and been almost unseated by his
marplot neighbour the indefatigable mr faddy
who rides his jogtrot hobby with equal zealand
is so bent upon improving and reforming
the neighbourhood that the squire thinks in a
little while it will be scarce worth living in the
enormity that has just discomposed my worthy
host is an attempt the manufacturer to have
a line coaches established that shall diverge
 travelling
from the old route and pass through the neighbouring
village i believe have mentioned that
the hall is situated in a retired part the country
at a distance from any great coach road in
so much that the arrival a traveller is apt to
make every one look out the window and to
cause some talk among the ale drinkers at the
little inn i was at a loss therefore to account
for the squire's indignation at a measure apparently
fraught with convenience and advantage
until i found that the conveniences travelling
were among his greatest grievances
in fact he rails against stage coaches post
chaises and turnpike roads as serious causes 
the corruption english rural manners they
have given facilities he says to every humdrum
citizen to trundle his family about the kingdom
and have sent the follies and fashions town
whirling in coach loads to the remotest parts 
the island the whole country he says is traversed
by these flying cargoes every byroad is
explored by enterprizing tourists from cheapside
and the poultry and every gentleman's park
travelling ill
and lawns invaded by cockney sketchers both
sexes with portable chairs and portfolios for
drawing
he laments over this as destroying the charm
 privacy and interrupting the quiet country
life but more especially as affecting the
simplicity the peasantry and filling their
heads with half city notions a great coach
inn he says is enough to ruin the manners 
a whole village it creates a horde sots and
idlers makes gapers and gazers and news
mongers the common people and knowing
jokes the country bumpkins the squire
has something the old feudal feeling he
looks back with regret to the good old times
when journeys were only made on horseback
and the extraordinary difficulties travelling
owing to bad roads bad accommodations and
highway robbers seemed to separate each village
and hamlet from the rest the world
the lord the manor was then a kind 
monarch in the little realm around him he
held his court in his paternal hall and was
 travelling
looked up to with almost as much loyalty and
deference as the king himself every neighbourhood
was a little world within itself having its
local manners and customs its local history and
local opinions the inhabitants were fonder 
their homes and thought less wandering it
was looked upon as an expedition to travel
out sight the parish steeple and a man
that had been to london w r as a village oracle for
the rest his life
what a difference between the mode travelling
in those days and at present at that
time when a gentlemen went on a distant visit
he set forth like a knight errant on an enterprize
 and every family excursion was a pageant
how splendid and fanciful must one 
those domestic cavalcades have been when
the beautiful dames were mounted on palfreys
magnificently caparisor i with embroidered
harness all tinkling with silver bells attended
by cavaliers richly attired on prancing steeds
and followed by pages and serving men as we
see them represented in old tapestry the gentravelling

try as they travelled about in those days were
like moving pictures they delighted the eyes
and awakened the admiration the common
people and passed before them like superior
beings and they were so there was a hardy
and healthful exercise connected with this
equestrian style that made them generous and
noble
in his fondness for the old style travelling
the squire makes most his journeys on horseback
 though he laments the modern deficiency
 incident on the road from the want fellow
wayfarers and the rapidity with which everyone
else is whirled along in coaches and post
chaises in the good old times on the contrary
a cavalier jogged on through bog and mire
from town to town and hamlet to hamlet conversing
with friars and franklins and all other

way with travellers tales which then were truly

the squire is fond too stopping at those
inns which may be met with here and there in
ancient houses wood and plaister or alliance
houses as they are called by antiquaries
with deep porches diamondpaned bow windows
and panelled rooms and great fireplaces
he will prefer them to more spacious and modern
inns and will cheerfully put up with bad
cheer and bad accommodations in the gratification
 his humour they give him he says

the feeling old times insomuch that he almost
expects in the dusk the evening to see
some party weary travellers ride up to the
door with plumes and mantles trunk hose wide
boots and long rapiers
the good squire's remarks brought to mind
a visit which i once paid to the tabard inn famous
for being the place assemblage from
whence chaucer's pilgrims set forth for canterbury
it is in the borough southwark not
far from london bridge and bears at present
the name the talbot it has sadly declined
in dignity since the days chaucer being a
mere rendezvous and packing place the great
wagons that travel into kent the court yard
which was anciently the mustering place the
pilgrims previous to their departure was now
lumbered with huge wagons crates boxes
hampers and baskets containing the good things
 town and country were piled about them 
while among the straw and litter the motherly
hens scratched and clucked with their hungry
broods at their heels instead chaucer's
 travelling
mostly and splendid throng i only saw a group
 wagoners and stable boys enjoying a circulating
pot ale while a long bodied dog sat
by with head on one side one ear cocked up
and wistful gaze as if waiting for his turn 
the tankard
notwithstanding this grievous declension
however i was gratified at perceiving that the
present occupants were not unconscious the
poetical renown their mansion
an inscription over the gateway proclaimed
it to be the inn where chaucer's pilgrims slept
on the night previous to their departure and at
the bottom the yard was a magnificent sign
representing them in the act sallying forth
i was pleased too at noticing that though the
present inn was comparatively modern yet
the form the old inn was preserved there
were galleries round the yard as in old times on
which opened the chambers the guests to
these ancient inns have antiquaries ascribed the
present forms our theatres plays were originally
acted in inn yards
travelling 
the guests lolled over the galleries which
answered to our modern dress circle the critical
mob clustered in the yard instead the pit and
the groups gazing from the garret windows were
no bad representatives the gods the shilling
gallery when therefore the drama grew important
enough to have a house its own the
architects took a hint for its construction from
the yard the ancient hostel
i was so well pleased at finding these remembrances
 chaucer and his poem that i took my
dinner in the little parlour the talbot whilst
it was preparing i sat by the window musing and
gazing into the court yard and conjuring up recollections
 the scenes depicted in such lively
colours by the poet until by degrees bales boxes
and hampers boys wagoners and dogs faded
from sight and my fancy peopled the place with
the mostly throng canterbury pilgrims the
galleries once more swarmed with idle gazers
in the rich dresses chaucer's time and the
whole cavalcade seemed to pass before me
there was the stately knight on sober steed who
 travelling
had ridden in healthiness and had fought
for our faith at tramissene and his son the
young squire a lover and a lusty bachelor with
curled locks and gay embroidery a bold rider a
dancer and a writer verses singing and fluting
all day long and fresh as the month may
and his knot beaded yeoman a bold forester in
green with horn and baldric and dagger a mighty
bow in hand and a sheaf peacock arrows
shining beneath his belt and the coy smiling
simple nun with her gray eyes her small red
mouth and fair forehead her coral beads about
her arm her golden broach with a love motto
and her pretty oath by saint ely and the
marchant solemn in speech and high on horse
with forked beard and flounders bever hat
and the sleek lusty monk on berry brown palfrey
 his hood fastened with gold pin wrought
with a love knot his bald head shining like
glass and his face glistening as though it had
been anointed and the lean logical sententious
clerke oxenforde upon his halfstarved
scholarlike horse and the bowing sompnour
travelling 
with fiery cherub face all knobbed with pirnpies
an eater garlic and onions and drinker
 strong wine red as blood that carried a
cake for a buckler and babbled latin in his
cups whose brimstone visage children
were sore afford and the buxom wife 
bath the widow five husbands upon her
ambling nag with her hat broad as a buckler
her red stockings and sharp spurs and
the slender choleric reeve norfolk with
close shaven beard and hair cropped round
his ears and long lean careless legs a rusty
blade by his side bestriding his good gray stot
and the jolly limitour with lisping tongue and
twinkling eye well beloved franklins and
housewives a great promoter marriages
among young women known at the taverns in
every town and by every hostler and gay
tapster in short before i was roused from
my reverie by the less poetical but more substantial
apparition a smoking beef steak 
had seen the whole cavalcade issue forth from
the hostel gate with the brawny double jointed
travelling
red haired miller playing the bagpipes before
them and the ancient host the tabard giving
them his farewell godsend to canterbury
when i told the squire the existence 
this legitimate descendant the ancient tabard
inn his eyes absolutely glistened with delight
he determined to hunt it up the very first time
he visited london and to eat a dinner there and
drink a cup mine host's best wine in memory

the general who happened to be present immediately
begged to be the party for he liked
to encourage these long established houses as
they are apt to have choice old wines

hill and dale doth boast thy blessing
milton
as i was lying in bed this morning enjoying
one those half dreams half reveries which
are so pleasant in the country when the birds are
singing about the window and the sunbeams
peeping through the curtains i was roused by
the sound music on going down stairs i
found a number villagers drest in their holyday
clothes bearing a pole ornamented with garlands
and ribbands and accompanied by the vilvol
 
 mayday
lage band music under the direction the
tailor the pale fellow who plays on the clarion
they had all sprigs hawthorn or as it is called
 the may in their hats and had brought
green branches and flowers to decorate the hall
door and windows they had come to give notice
that the maypole was reared on the green
and to invite the household to witness the sports
the hall according to custom became a scene
 hurry and delighted confusion the servants
were all agog with may and music and there
was no keeping the tongues or the feet the
maids quiet who were anticipating the sports 
the green and the evening dance
i repaired to the village at an early hour to
enjoy the merrymaking the morning was
pure and sunny such as a maymorning is always
described the fields were white with daisies 
the hawthorn was covered with its fragrant blossoms
the bee hummed about every bank and
the swallow played high in the air about the village
steeple it was one those days when
we seem to draw in pleasure with the very air
mayday 
we breathe and to feel happy we know not why
whoever has felt the worth worthy man or
has doated on lovely woman will on such a day
call them tenderly to mind and feel his heart all
alive with long buried recollections
before reaching the village i saw the maypole
towering above the cottages with its gay
garlands and streamers and heard the sound 
music i found that there had been booths setup
near it for the reception company and a
bower green branches and flowers for the
queen may a fresh rosycheeked girl the
village
a band morris dancers were capering on
the green in their fantastic dresses jingling with
hawks bells with a boy dressed up as maid
marian and the attendant fool rattling his box
to collect contributions from the bystanders
i noticed also the gipsy women already
plying their mystery in scorners the village
reading the hands the simple country
girls and no doubt promising them all good
husbands and tribes children
 mayday
the squire made his appearance in the
course the morning attended by the parson
and was received with loud acclamations he
mingled among the country people throughout
the day giving and receiving pleasure wherever
he went
the amusements the day were under the
management slingsbyby the schoolmaster 
who is not merely lord misrule in his
school but likewise master the revels to the
village he was bustling about with the perplexed
and anxious air a man who has the
oppressive burthen promoting other people's
merriment upon his mind he had involved
himself in a dozen scrapes in consequence 
a politic intrigue which by the bye master
simon and the oxonian were at the bottom 
which had for object the election the queen
 may he had met with violent opposition
from a faction ale drinkers who were in favour
 a bouncing bar maid the daughter the tavern
keeper but he had been too strongly backed
not to carry his point though it shows that
mayday 
these crowns like all others are objects 
great ambition and heart burning j am told
that master simon takes great interest though
in an underhand way in the election these
may day queens and that the chaplet is generally
secured for some rustic beauty that has
found favour in his eyes
in the course the day there were various
games strength and agility on the green at
which a knot village veterans presided as
judges the lists among these i perceived
that ready money jack took the lead looking
with a learned and critical eye on the merits 
the different candidates his hat was drawn a
little on one side over his brow which gave
additional effect to his decisions and though he
was very laconic and sometimes merely expressed
himself by a nod yet it was evident that his
opinions far outweighed those the most
loquacious
young jack tibbets was the hero the day
and carried off most the prizes though in
some the feats agility he was rivalled by the
 mayday
prodigal son who appeared much in his
element on this occasion but his most formidable
competitor was the notorious gipsy the redoubtable
starlight tom i was rejoiced at
having an opportunity seeing this minion
 the moon in broad daylight i found him
to be a tall swarthy goodlooking fellow with
a lofty air something like i have seen in an indian
chieftain and with a certain lounging easy and
almost graceful carriage which i have often remarked
in beings the macaroni order that
lead an idle loitering life and have a gentlemanlike
contempt labour
master simon and the general reconnoitred
the ground together indulging a vast deal 
harmless raking among the buxom country girls
master simon would give some them a kiss
on meeting with them and would ask after their
sisters for he is acquainted with most the farmers
families sometimes he would whisper
and affect to talk mischievously with them and
if bantered on the subject would turn it off with
a laugh though it was evident he liked to be
mayday 
suspected being a gay lothario amongst
them
he had much to say to the farmers about their
farms and seemed to know all their horses byname
there was an old fellow with a round
ruddy face and a night cap under his hat who
is the wit the village and who took several
occasions to crack a joke with master simon in
the hearing his companions to whom he
would turn and wink hard when master simon
had passed
the harmony the day however had nearly
at one time been interrupted by the appearance
 the radical on the ground with two or three
 his disciples he soon got engaged in argument
in the very thick the throng above
which i could hear his voice and now and then
see his meagre hand half a mile out the
sleeve elevated in the air in violent gesticulation
and flourishing a pamphlet by way truncheon
he was decrying these idle nonsensical amusements
in times public distress when it was
every one's business to think other matters
 mayday
and to be miserable the honest village logicians
could make no stand against him especially
as he was seconded by his proselytes when to
their great joy master simon and the general
got embroiled in the discussion i saw that the
former rather entered into it with an ill grace
from which i was persuaded that he must before
this have had a brush with the radical but the
general was too loyal to suffer such talk in his
hearing and thought no doubt that a look and
a word from a gentleman would be sufficient to
shut up so shabby an orator the latter however
was no respecter persons but rather
seemed to exult in having such important antagonists
he talked with greater volubility than
ever and soon drowned them in declamation on
the subject taxes poor's rates and the national
debt master simon endeavoured to
brush along in his usual excursive manner which
had always answered amazingly well with the
villagers but the radical was one those pestilent
fellows that pin a man down to facts and
indeed he had two or three pamphlets in his
mayday 
pocket to support every thing he advanced by
printed documents in a word the two worthies
from the hall were completely dumbfounded
and this too in the presence several master
simon's staunch admirers who had always
looked up to him as infallible i do not know
how he and the general would have managed to
draw their forces decently from the field had
there not been a match grinning through a
horsecollar announced whereupon the radical
retired with great expression contempt and as
soon as his back was turned the argument was
carried against him all hollow
in the latter part the day the ladies from
the hall paid a visit to the green the fair
julia made her appearance leaning on her lover's
arm and looking extremely pale and
interesting as she is a great favourite in
the village where she has been known from
childhood and as her late accident had been
much talked about the sight her caused very
manifest delight and some the old women 
the village blessed her sweet face as she passed
vol 
 mayday
while they were walking about i noticed the
little schoolmaster in earnest conversation with
the young girl that represented the queen 
may evidently endeavouring to spirit her up to
some formidable undertaking at length as the
party from the hall approached her bower she
came forth faltering at every step until she
reached the spot where the fair julia stood between
her lover and lady lillycraft the little
queen then took the chaplet flowers from
her head and attempted to put it on that the
bride elect but the confusion both was so
great that the wreath would have fallen to the
ground had not the officer caught it and
laughing placed it upon the blushing brows 
his mistress there was something charming
in the very embarrassment these two young
creatures both so beautiful yet so different in
their kinds beauty master simon told me
afterwards that the queen may was to have
spoken a few verses which the schoolmaster had
written for her but that she had neither wit to
understand nor memory to recollect them
mayday 
besides added he between you and i she
murders the king's english abominably so
she has acted the part a wise woman in
holding her tongue and trusting to her pretty
face
among the other characters from the hall
was mrs hannah my lady lillycraft's gentlewoman
 to my surprise she was escorted by
old christy the huntsman and followed by his
ghost a greyhound but i find they are very
old acquaintances being drawn together by
some sympathy disposition mrs hannah
moved about with starched dignity among the
rustics who drew back from her with more awe
than they did from her mistress her mouth
seemed shut as with a clasp excepting that i
now and then heard the word fellows escape
from between her lips as she got accidentally
jostled in the crowd
but there was one other heart present that did
not enter into the merriment the scene which
was that the simple phoebe wilkins the
housekeeper's niece the poor girl has 

tinned to pine and whine for some time past
in consequence the obstinate coldness her
lover never was a little flirtation more severely
punished she appeared this day on the green
gallant by a smart servant out livery and
had evidently resolved to try the hazardous experiment
 awakening the jealousy her lover
she was dressed out in her very best affected
an air great gayety talked loud and girlishly
and laughed when there was nothing to laugh at
there was however an aching heavy heart in
the poor baggage's bosom under all this levity
i saw her eye in the midst her mirth turn
with an anxious expression every now and then
in quest her reckless swain and her cheek
turned pale and her fictitious gayety vanished
on his paying his rustic homage to the little
mayday queen
my attention was now diverted by a fresh stir
and bustle music was heard at a distance 
a banner was seen advancing up the road preceded
by a rustic band playing something like
a march and followed by a sturdy throng the
mayday 
chivalry a neighbouring and rival village
no sooner had they reached the green than they
challenged the heroes the day to new trials 
strength and activity several gymnastic contests
ensued for the honour the respective
villages in the course these exercises young
tibbets and the champion the adverse party
had an obstinate match at wrestling they
tugged and strained and panted without either
getting the mastery until both came to the
ground and rolled upon the green
just then the disconsolate phoebe came by
she saw her recreant lover in fierce contest as
she thought and in danger in a moment pride
pique and coquetry were forgotten she darted
into the ring seized upon the rival champion by
the hair and was on the point wreaking on
him her puny vengeance when a buxom strapping
country lass the sweetheart the prostrate
swain pounced upon her like a hawk and would
have stripped her her fine plumage in an instant
had she not been seized in her turn
a complete tumult ensued the chivalry 
 mayday
the two villages became embroiled blows
began to be dealt and sticks to be flourished
phoebe was carried off from the field in hysterics
in vain did the sages the village interfere
i saw the sententious apothecary tumbled into
the dirt as he was endeavouring to spread the oil
 wisdom over this tempestuous sea passion
slingsbyby who is a great lover peace went
into the midst the throng as marshal the
day to put an to the commotion but was
speedily rent in twain and came out with his
garment hanging in two strips from his shoulders
 while the prodigal son dashed in with fury
to revenge the insult which his patron had sustained

the tumult thickened i caught glimpses 
the jockey cap old christy like the helmet 
a chieftain bobbing about in the midst the
scuffle while mistress hannah separated from
her doughty protector was squalling and striking
at right and left with a faded parasol being tossed
and tousled about by the crowd in such wise
as was never maiden gentlewoman before
mayday 
at length i beheld old ready money jack
making his way into the very thickest the
throng tearing it as it were apart and enforcing
peace et armis it was surprising to seethe
sudden quiet that ensued the storm settled
down into tranquillity the parties having no
real grounds hostility became readily pacified
and in fact were a little at a loss to know why
they had got by the ears the schoolmaster
was pinned together again by his wife mrs
hannah drew on one side to plume her rumpled
feathers and then swept back again to the hall
ten times more bitter against mankind than ever
the tibbets family alone seemed slow in recovering
from the agitation the scene young
jack was evidently very much moved by the heroism
 the unlucky phoebe his mother
who had been summoned to the field action
by news the affray was in a sad panic and
had need all her management to keep him
from following his mistress and having a perfect
reconciliation
 mayday
what heightened the alarm and perplexity 
the good managing dame was that the matter
had aroused the slow apprehension old
ready money himself who was very much
struck by the intrepid interference so pretty
and delicate a girl and was sadly puzzled to understand
the meaning the violent agitation in
his family
when all this came to the ears the squire
he was grievously scandalized that his mayday
fete should have been disgraced by such a brawl
he ordered phoebe to appear before him but the
girl was so frightened and distressed that she
appeared sobbing and trembling and could make
no answer to his questions
lady lillycraft who had understood there
was an affair the heart at the bottom this
distress immediately took the girl into great
favour and protection and made her peace with
the squire
this was the only thing that disturbed the harmony
 the day if we except the discomfiture
 master simon and the general by the radical
matday 
upon the whole therefore the squire had very
fair reason to be satisfied that he had rode his
hobby throughout the day without any other
molestation
the reader learned in these matters will perceive
that all this was but a faint shadow the
once gay and fanciful rites may the peasantry
have lost the proper feeling for these rites
and have grown almost as strange to them as the
boors la marcia were to the customs 
chivalry in the days the valorous don quixote
indeed i considered it a proof the discretion
with which the squire rides his hobby
that he had not pushed the thing any farther
nor attempted to revive many obsolete usages 
the day which in the present matteroffact
times would appear affected and absurd i must
say however though i do it under the rose that
the general brawl in which this festival had nearly
terminated has made me doubt whether these
rural customs the good old times were
always so very loving and innocent as we are
apt to fancy them and whether the peasantry
vol 
 mayday
in those times were really so arcadian as they
have been fondly represented i begin to fear
those days were never airy dreams
sat for the picture and the poet's hand
imparting substance to an empty shade
impos'd a gay delirium for a truth
grant it i still must envy them an age
that favoured such a dream
the manuscript
yesterday was a day quiet and repose
after the bustle mayday during the morning
i joined the ladies in a small sitting room
the windows which came down to the floor
and opened upon a terrace the garden which
was set out with delicate shrubs and flowers
the soft sunshine that fell into the room through
the branches trees that overhung the windows
 the sweet smell the flowers and the
singing the birds seemed to produce a pleasing
yet calming effect on the whole party for
some time elapsed without any one speaking
lady lillycraft and miss templeton were
sitting by an elegant work table near one the
windows occupied with some pretty ladylike
work the captain was on a stool at his mistress
feet looking over some music and poor
 the manuscript
phoebe wilkins who has always been a kind 
pet among the ladies but who has risen vastly in
favour with lady lillycraft in consequence 
some tender confessions sat in one corner with
swoln eyes working pensively at some the
fair julia's wedding ornaments the silence
was interrupted by her ladyship who suddenly
proposed a task to the captain i am in your
debt said she for that tale you read to us the
other day i will now furnish one in return if
you'll read it and it is just suited to this sweet
may morning for it is all about love 
the proposition seemed to delight every one
present the captain smiled assent her ladyship
rang for her page in green and despatched
him to her room for the manuscript
as the captain said she gave us an account
 the author his story it is but right
i should give one mine it was written by
the parson the parish where i reside a
thin elderly man a delicate constitution but
positively one the most charming men that
ever lived he lost his wife a few years since
the manuscript 
one the sweetest women you ever saw he
has two sons whom he educates himself both
 whom already write delightful poetry this
parsonage is a lovely place close by the church 
all overrun with ivy and honeysuckles with
the sweetest flower garden about it for you
know our country clergymen are almost always
fond flowers and make their parsonages perfect
pictures
his living is a very good one and he is
very much beloved and does a great deal 
good in the neighbourhood and among the poor
and then such sermons as he preaches oh if
you could only hear one taken from a text in
solomon's songs all about love and marino
none the sweetest things you ever heard
he preaches it at least once a year in springtime
for he knows i am fond it
he always dines with me on sundays and
often brings rne some the sweetest pieces 
poetry all about the pleasures melancholy
and such subjects that make me cry so you
can't think
 the manuscript
i wish he would publish i think he has
some things as sweet as any thing in moore or
lord byron
he fell into very ill health some time ago
and was advised to go to the continent and i
gave him no peace until he went and promised
to take care his two boys until he returned
he was gone for above a year and was quite
restored when he came back he sent me the
tale i'm going to show you oh here it is said
she as the page put in her hands a beautiful
box satin wood she unlocked it and from
among several parcels notes on embossed paper
cards charades and copies verses
she drew out a crimson velvet case that smelt
very much perfumes
from this she took a manuscript daintily written
on giltedged vellum paper and stitched
with a light blue ribband this she handed to
the captain who read the following tale which
i have procured for the satisfaction the reader
annette delamere
oh wander no more on the storm beaten shore
nor heed the loud whistling gale 
nor strain thy sad eye to where sea meets with sky
in search thy true lover's sail
anon
in the course a tour that i once made in

lower normandy i remained for a day or two
at the old town honfleur which standgrnear
the mouth the seine it was the timgof a fete
and all the world was thronging in jtfoe evening
to dance at the fair held before the chapel our
lady grace as i like all kings isitcent
merrymaking i joined the throng
the chapel is situated on the top a high
hill or promontory from whence its bell maybe
heard at a distance by the mariner at night
it is said to have given the name to the port 
 annette delamere
 havre de grace which lies directly opposite
on the other side the seine the road up to
the chapel went in a zigzag course along the
brow the steep coast it was shaded by trees
from between which i had beautiful peeps at
the ancient towers moniteur below the varied
scenery the opposite shore the white
buildings havre in the distance and the
wide sea beyond the road was enlivened by
groups peasant girls in their bright crimson
dresses and tall caps and i found all the flower
 the neighbourhood assembled on the green
that crowns the summit the hill
xje chapel notre dame de grace is a
favourite resort the inhabitants honfleur
and its vicinity both for pleasure and devotion

at this littk chapel prayers are put up by the
mariners r ne p ort previous to their voyages
and by their friends during their absence and
votive offerings are hung about its walls in fulfilment
 vows made during times shipwreck
and disaster the chapel is surrounded by
trees over the portal is an image the virgin
annette delamere 
arid child with an inscription which struck meas
being quite poetical 
etoile de la mer priez pour nous
star the sea pray for us
on a level spot near the chapel under a grove
 noble trees the populace dance on fine summer
evenings and here are held frequent fairs
and fetes which assemble all the rustic beauty
 the loveliest parts lower normandy the
present was an occasion the kind booths
and tents were erected among the trees there
were the usual displays finery to tempt the
rural coquette wonderful shows to entice
the curious mountebanks were exerting their
eloquence jugglers and fortunetellers astonishing
the credulous while whole rows grotesque
saints in wood and waxwork were offered
for the purchase the pious
the fete had assembled in one view all the
picturesque costumes the pays d'ange and
the cote de caux i beheld tall stately caps and
vol it 
 annette delamere
trim bodies according to fashions which have
been handed down from mother to daughter for
centuries the exact counterparts those worn
in the time the conqueror and which surprised
me by their faithful resemblance to those
which i had seen in the old pictures froissart's
chronicles and in the paintings illuminated
manuscripts any one also that has been
in lower normandy must have remarked the
beauty the peasantry and that air native
elegance which prevails among them it is to
this country undoubtedly that the english owe
their good looks it was from hence that the
bright carnation the fine blue eye the light auburn
hair passed over to england in the train
 the conqueror and filled the land with beauty
the scene before me was perfectly enchanting
the assemblage so many fresh and
blooming faces the gay groups in fanciful
dresses some dancing on the green others
strolling about or seated on the grass the fine
clumps trees in the foreground bordering the
annette delamere 
brow this airy height and the broad green
sea sleeping in summer tranquillity in the distance

whilst i was regarding this animated picture
i was struck with the appearance a beautiful
girl who passed through the crowd without
seeming to take any interest in their amusements
she was slender and delicate in her form she
had not the bloom upon her cheek that is usual
among the peasantry normandy and her
blue eyes had a singular and melancholy expression
she was accompanied by a venerable
looking man whom i presumed to be her father
there was a whisper among the bystanders and
a wistful look after her as she passed the young
men touched their hats and some the children
followed her at a little distance watching her
movements she approached the edge the
hill where there is a little platform from whence
the people honfleur look out for the approach
 vessels here she stood for some time gazing
on the sea and waving her handkerchief though
there was nothing to be seen but two or three
 annette delamere
fishing boats far below like mere specks on the
bosom the distant ocean
these circumstances excited my curiosity and
i made some inquiries about her which were
answered with readiness and intelligence by a
priest the neighbouring chapel our conversation
drew together several the bystanders
each whom had something to communicate
and from them all i gathered the following particulars

annette delarbre was the only daughter 
one the higher order farmers or small proprietors
as they are called who lived at pont
l'eveque a pleasant village not far from honfleur
in that rich pastoral part lower normandy
called the pays d'ange annette was
the pride and delight her parents and was
brought up with the fondest indulgence she
was gay tender petulant and susceptible all
her feelings were quick and ardent and having
never experienced contradiction or restraint she
was little practised in selfcontrol nothing but
annette delamere 
the native goodness her heart kept her from
running continually into error
even while a child her susceptibility was
evinced in an attachment which she formed to a
playmate eugene la forge the only son a
widow who lived in the neighbourhood their
childish love was an epitome maturer passion 
it had its caprices and jealousies and quarrels
and reconciliations it was assuming something
 a graver character as annette entered her fifteenth
and eugene his nineteenth year when
he was suddenly carried off to the army by the
conscription it was a heavy blow to his widowed
mother for he was her only pride and comfort
 but it was one those sudden bereavements
which mothers were perpetually doomed
to feel in france during the time that continual
and bloody wars were incessantly draining her
youth it was a temporary affliction also to annette
to lose her lover with tender embraces
half childish half womanish she parted from
him the tears streamed from her blue eyes as
she bound a long braid her fair hair round his
 annette delamere
wrist but the smiles still broke through for
she was yet too young to feel how serious a thing
is separation and how many chances there are
when parting in this wide world against our ever
meeting again
weeks months years flew by annette increased
in beauty as she increased in years and
was the reigning belle the neighbourhood her
time passed innocently and happily her father
was a man some consequence in the rural
community and his house was the resort the
gayest the village annette held a kind rural
court she was always surrounded by companions
 her own age among whom she shone
unrivalled much their time was past in
making lace the prevalent manufacture the
neighbourhood as they sat at this delicate and
feminine labour the merry tale and sprightly
song went round none laughed with a lighter
heart than annette and if she sang her voice
was perfect melody their evenings were enlivened
by the dance or by those pleasant social
games so prevalent among the french and
annette delamere 
when she appeared at the village ball on sunday
evenings she was the theme universal admiration

as she was a rural heiress she did not want
for suitors many advantageous offers were
made her but she refused them all she laughed
at the pretended pangs her admirers and
triumphed over them with the caprice buoyant
youth and conscious beauty with all her
apparent levity however could any one have
read the story her heart they might have traced
in it some fond remembrance her early
playmate not so deeply graven as to be painful 
but too deep to be easily obliterated and they
might have noticed amidst all her gayety the
tenderness that marked her manner towards the
mother eugene she would often steal away
from her youthful companions and their amusements
to pass whole days with the good widow 
listening to her fond talk about her boy and
blushing with secret pleasure when his letters
were read at finding herself a constant theme
 recollection and inquiry
 annette delamere
at length the sudden return peice which
sent many a warrior to his native cottage brought
back eugene a young sunburnt soldier to the
village i need not say how rapturously his return
was greeted by his mother who saw in
him the pride and staff her old age he had
risen in the service by his merit but brought
away little from the wars excepting a soldierlike
air a gallant name and a scar across the
forehead he brought back however a nature
unspoiled by the camp he was frank open
generous and ardent his heart was quick and
kind in its impulses and was perhaps a little
softer from having suffered it was full tenderness
for annette he had received frequent
accounts her from his mother and the mention
 her kindness to his lonely parent had
rendered ner doubly dear to him he had been
wounded he had been a prisoner he had been
in various troubles but he had always preserved
the braid her hair which she had bound round
his arm it had been a kind talisman to
him when wounded and in prison he had many
annette delamere 
a time looked upon it as he lay on the hard
ground and the thought that he might one day
see annette again and the fair fields about his
native village had cheered his heart and enabled
him to bear up against every hardship
he had left anne te almost a child he found
her a blooming woman if he had loved her
before he now adored her annette was equally
struck with the improvement which time had
made in her lover she noticed with secret admiration
his superiority to the other young men
 the village the frank lofty military air that
distinguished him from all the rest at their rural
gatherings the more she saw him the more
her light playful fondness former years deepened
into ardent and powerful affection but
annette was a rural belle she had tasted the
sweets dominion and had been rendered
wilful and capricious by constant indulgence at
home and admiration abroad she was conscious
 her power over eugene and delighted
in exercising it she sometimes treated him
with petulant caprice enjoying the pain which
vol 
 annette delamere
she inflicted by her frowns from the idea how
soon she would chace it away again by her
smiles she took a pleasure in alarming his
fears by affecting a temporary preference to someone
or other his rivals and then would delight
in allaying them by an ample measure 
returning kindness perhaps there was some
degree vanity gratified by all this it might bea
matter triumph to show her absolute power
over the young soldier who was the universal
object female admiration eugene however
was too serious and ardent a nature to be
trifled with he loved too fervently not to be
filled with doubt he saw annette surrounded
by admirers and full animation the gayest
among the gay at all their rural festivities
and apparently most gay when he was most
dejected every one saw through this caprice
but himself every one saw that in reality she
doated on him but eugene alone suspected the
sincerity her affection for some time he
bore this coquetry with secret impatience and
distrust but his feelings grew sore and irritable
annette delamere 
and overcame his self command a slight misunderstanding
took place a quarrel ensued
annette unaccustomed to be thwarted and contradicted
and full the insolence youthful
beauty assumed an air disdain she refused
all explanations to her lover and they parted in
anger that very evening eugene saw her full
 gayety dancing with one his rivals and
as her eye caught his his fixed on her with unfeigned
distress it sparkled with more than usual
vivacity it was a finishing blow to his hopes
already so much impaired by secret distrust
pride and resentment both struggled in his breast 
and seemed to rouse his spirit to all its wonted
energy he retired from her presence with
the hasty determination never to see her again
a woman is more considerate in affairs 
love than man because love is more the study
and business her life annette soon repented
 her indiscretion she felt that she had used
her lover unkindly she felt that she had trifled
with his sincere and generous nature and then
he looked so handsome when he parted after
 annette delamere
their quarrel his fine features lighted up by indignation
she had intended making up with him
at the evening dance but his sudden departure
prevented her she now promised herself that
when next they met she would amply repay
him by the sweets a perfect reconciliation
and that thenceforward she would never never
tease him more 
that promise was not to be fulfilled day
after day passed but eugene did not make his
appearance sunday evening came the usual
time when all the gayety the village assembled
but eugene was not there she inquired
after him he had left the village she now
became alarmed and forgetting all coyness and
affected indifference called on eugene's mother
for an explanation she found her full affliction
and learnt with surprise and consternation
that eugene had gone to sea
while his feelings were yet smarting with
her affected disdain and his heart a prey to alternate
indignation and despair he had suddenly
embraced an invitation which had repeatedly
annette delamere 
been made him by a relative who was fitting
out a ship from the port honfleur and who
wished him to be the companion his voyage
absence appeared to him the only cure for his
unlucky passion and in the temporary transports
 his feelings there was something gratifying
in the idea having half the world intervene
between them the hurry necessary for
his departure left no time for cool reflection it
rendered him deaf to the remonstrances his
afflicted mother he hastened to honfleur justin
time to make the needful preparations for the
voyage and the first news that annette received
 this sudden determination was a letter delivered
by his mother returning her pledges 
affection particularly the long treasured braid
 her hair and bidding her a last farewell in
terms more full sorrow and tenderness than
upbraiding
this was the first stroke real anguish that
annette had ever received and it overcame her
 
the vivacity her spirits were apt to hurry her
to extremes she for a time gave way to ungo
 annette delamere
enable transports affliction and remorse and
discovered by her violent exclamations the real
ardour her affection the thought occurred
to her that the ship might not yet have sailed 
she seized on the hope with eagerness and hastened
with her father to honfleur the ship
had sailed that very morning from the heights
above the town she saw it lessening to a speck
on the broad bosom the ocean and before
evening the white sail had faded from her sight
she turned full anguish to the neighbouring
chapel our lady grace and throwing
herself on the pavement poured out prayers and
tears for the safe return her lover
when she returned home the cheerfulness 
her spirits was at an she looked back with
remorse and self upbraiding at her past caprices 
she turned with distaste from the adulation 
her admirers and had no longer any relish for
the amusements the village with humiliation
and diffidence she sought the widowed mother
 eugene but was received by her with
an overflowing heart for she only beheld in her
annette delamere 
one who could sympathize in her doating fondness
for her son it seemed some alleviation 
her remorse to sit by the mother all day to
study her wants to beguile her heavy hours 
to hang about her with the caressing endearments
 a daughter and to seek by every means if possible
to supply the place the son whom she
reproached herself with having driven away
in the mean time the ship made a prosperous
voyage to her destined port eugene's mother
received a letter from him in which he lamented
the precipitancy his departure the voyage
had given him time for sober reflection if annette
had been unkind to him he ought not to
have forgotten what was due to his mother who
was now advanced in years he accused himself
 selfishness in only listening to the suggestions
 his own inconsiderate passions he
promised to return with the ship to make his
mind up to his disappointment and to think 
nothing but making iii mother happy and
when he does return said annette clasping her
 annette delamere
hands with transport it shall not be tiny fault
if he ever leaves us again 
the time approached for the ship's return
she was daily expected when the weather became
dreadfully tempestuous day after day
brought news vessels foundered or driven on
shore and the sea coast was strewed with
wrecks intelligence was received the looked
for ship having been seen dismasted in a violent
storm and the greatest fears were entertained for
her safety
annette never left the side eugene's mother
she watched every change her countenance
with painful solicitude and endeavoured
to cheer her with hopes while her own mind
was racked by anxiety she tasked her efforts
to be gay but it was a forced and unnatural
gayety a sigh from the mother would completely
check it and when she could no longer
restrain the rising tears she would hurry away
and pour out her agony in secret
every anxious look every anxious inquiry 
the mother whenever a door opened or a strange
annette delamere 
face appeared was an arrow to her soul she
considered every disappointment as a pang her
own infliction and her heart sickened under the
careworn expression the maternal eye at
length this suspense became insupportable she
left the village and hastened to honfleur hoping
every hour every moment to receive some tidings
 her lover she paced the pier and wearied
the seamen the port with her inquiries she
made a daily pilgrimage to the chapel our
lady grace hung votive garlands on the
wall and passed hours either kneeling before
the altar or looking out from the brow the
hill upon the angry sea
at length word was brought that the long
wished for vessel was in sight she was seen
standing into the mouth the seine shattered
and crippled bearing marks having been sadly
tempest tost there was a general joy diffused
by her return and there was not a brighter eye
nor a lighter heart than annette's in the little
port honfleur the ship came to anchor in
the river and shortly after a boat put off for the
vol 
annette delamere
shore the populace crowded down to the
pier head to welcome it annette stood blushing
and smiling and trembling and weeping 
for a thousand painfully pleasing emotions agitated
her breast at the thoughts the meeting
and the reconciliation that was about to take
place her heart throbbed to pour itself out
and atone to her gallant lover for all its errors
her agitation increased as the boat drew near 
until it became distressing at one moment
she placed herself in a conspicuous place where
she might at once catch his view and surprize
him by her welcome the next moment she
shrunk among the throng trembling and faint
and gasping with her emotions
it was almost a relief to her when she perceived
that her lover was not in the boat she
presumed that he had remained on board to prepare
for his return home and she felt as if the
delay would enable her to gather more selfpos
session for the meeting as the boat was nearing
the shore there were a thousand inquiries
made and laconic answers returned at length
annette delamere 
annette heard some one inquire after her lover
her heart palpitated there was a moment's
pause the reply was brief but awful he had
been washed from the deck with two the
crew in the midst a stormy night when it
was impossible to render any assistance a
piercing shriek broke from among the crowd
and annette had nearly fallen into the waves
the sudden revulsion feelings after such
wearing anxiety was too much for her frame
she was carried home senseless her life was
for some time despaired and it was months
before she recovered her health but she never
had perfectly recovered her mind it still remained
unsettled with respect to her lover's
fate
the subject continued my informer is
never mentioned in her hearing but she sometimes
speaks it and it seems as though there
were some vague train impressions in her
mind in which hope and fear are strangely
mingled some imperfect idea his shipwreck
and yet some expectation his return
annette delamere
her parents have tried every means to cheer
her up and to banish these gloomy images from
her thoughts they assemble round her the
young companions in whose society she used to
delight and they will work and chat and sing
and laugh as formerly but she will sit silently
among them and will sometimes weep in the
midst their gayety and if spoken to will
make no reply but look up with streaming eyes
and sing a dismal little song which she has learnt
somewhere about a shipwreck it makes everyone's
heart ache to see her in this way for she
used to be the happiest creature in the village
she passes the greater part the time with
eugene's mother whose only consolation is her
society and who doats on her with a mother's
tenderness she is the only one that has perfect
influence over annette in every mood the
poor girl seems as formerly to make an effort to
be cheerful in her company but will sometimes
gaze upon her with the most piteous look and
then put back her cap and kiss her gray hairs
and fall on her neck and weep
annette delamere 
 she is not always melancholy however 
she has occasional intervals when she will be
bright and animated for days together but there
is a degree wildness attending these fits 
gayety that prevents their yielding any encouragement
to her friends at such times she will
arrange her room which is all covered with pictures
 ships and legends saints and will
wreath a white chaplet as if for a wedding and
prepare wedding ornaments she will listen
anxiously at the door and look frequently at the
window as if expecting some one s arrival it
is supposed that at such times she is looking for
her lover's return but as no one touches upon
the theme or mentions his name in her presence
the current her thoughts are for the most part
merely conjecture
now and then she will rriake a pilgrimage
to the chapel notre dame de grace where
she will pray for hours at the altar and decorate
the images with wreaths that she has woven or
will wave her handkerchief from the terrace
 annette delamere
as you have seen if there is any vessel to be
seen in the distance
nearly two years he informed me had
now elapsed without effacing from her mind
this singular taint insanity still her friends
hoped it might gradually wear away they
had at one time removed her to a distant part 
the country in hopes that absence from the scenes
connected with her story might have a salutary
effect but when her periodical melancholy returned
she became more restless and wretched
than usual and privately escaping from her
friends set out on foot without knowing the
road on one her pilgrimages to the chapel
this little story entirely drew my attention
from the gay scene the fete and fixed it upon
the beautiful annette while she was yet standing
on the terrace the vesper bell was rung from
the neighbouring chapel she listened for a moment
and then drawing a small rosary from her
bosom walked in that direction several the
peasantry followed her in silence and i felt too
much interested not to do the same
annette delamere 
the chapel as i said before is in the midst 
a grove on the high promontory the inside is
hung round with miniature ships and rude paintings
 wrecks and perils at sea and providential
deliverance the votive offerings captains and
crews that have been saved on entering annette
paused for a moment before a picture the
virgin which i observed had recently been decorated
with a wreath artificial flowers when
she reached the middle the chapel she knelt
down and those who followed her involuntarily
did the same at a little distance the evening
sun shone softly through the chequered grove into
one window the chapel a perfect stillness
reigned within and this stillness was the more
impressive contrasted with the distant sound 
music and merriment the fair
i could not take my eyes off from the poor
suppliant her lips moved as she told her beads 
but her prayers were breathed in silence it
might have been mere fancy excited by the scene
that as she raised her eyes to heaven i thought
they had an expression truly seraphic but i am
 annette delamere
easily affected by female beauty and there was
something in this mixture love devotion and
partial insanity that was inexpressibly touching

as the poor girl left the chapel there was a
sweet serenity in her looks and i was told that
she w r ould now return home and in all probability
be calm and cheerful for days and even
weeks in which time it was supposed that hope
predominated in her mental malady and that
when the dark side her mind as her friends
called it was about to turn up it would be known
by her neglecting her distaff or her lace singing
plaintive songs and weeping in silence
she passed on from the chapel without noticing
the fete but smiling and speaking to many
as she passed i followed her with my eye as
she descended the winding road towards honfleur
leaning on her father's arm heaven
thought i has ever its store balms for the
hurt mind and wounded spirit and may in time
raise up this broken flower to be once more the
pride and joy the valley the very delusion
annette delamere 
in which the poor girl walks may be one 
those mists kindly diffused by providence over
the regions thought when they become too
fruitful misery the veil may gradually be
raised which obscures the horizon her mind
as she is enabled steadily and calmly to contemplate
the sorrows at present hidden in mercy
from her view

part 
on my return from paris about a year afterwards
i turned off from the beaten route at
rouen to revisit some the most striking scenes
 lower normandy has ing passed through
the lovely country the pays d'ange i reached
honfleur on a fine afternoon intending to
cross to havre the next morning and embark for
england as i had no other way passing
the evening i strolled up the hill to enjoy the
fine prospect from the chapel notre dame de
grace and while there i thought inquiring
after the fate poor annette delarbre the
priest who had told me her story was officiating
at vespers after which i accosted him and learnt
from him the remaining circumstances
he told me that from the time i had seen herat
the chapel her disorder took a sudden turn for
the worse and her health rapidly declined her
cheerful intervals became shorter and less free
delamere 
quest and attended with more incoherency she
grew languid silent and moody in her melancholy
 her form was wasted her looks pale
and disconsolate and it was feared she would
never recover she became impatient all
sounds gayety and was never so contented
as when eugene's mother was near her the
good woman watched over her with patient and
yearning solicitude and in seeking to beguile
her sorrows would half forget her own sometimes
as she sat looking upon her pallid face the
tears would fill her eyes which when annette
perceived she would anxiously wipe them away
and tell her not to grieve for that eugene would
soon return and then she would affect a forced
gayety as in former times and sing a lively air 
but a sudden recollection would come over her
and she would burst into tears hang on the poor
mother's neck and entreat her not to curse her
for having destroyed her son
just at this time to the astonishment everyone
news was received eugene who it appeared
was still living when almost drowned
 annette delamere
he had fortunately seized upon a spar which had
been washed from the ship's deck finding
himself nearly exhausted he had fastened himself
to it and floated for a day and a night until all
sense had left him on recovering he had found
himself on board a vessel bound to india but so
ill as not to move without assistance his health
had continued precarious throughout the voyage
on arriving in india he had experienced many
vicissitudes and had been transferred from ship
to ship and hospital to hospital his constitution
had enabled him to struggle through every
hardship and he was now in a distant port
waiting only for the sailing a ship to return
home
great caution was necessary in imparting
these tidings to the mother and even then she
was nearly overcome by the transports her
joy but how to impart them to annette was a
matter still greater perplexity her state 
mind had been so morbid she had been subject to
such violent changes and the cause her derangement
had been such an inconsolable
annette delamere 
and hopeless kind that her friends had always
forbore to tamper with her feelings they had
never even hinted at the subject her griefs 
nor encouraged the theme when she adverted toit
 but had passed it over in silence hoping that
time would gradually wear the traces it from
her recollection or at least would render them
less painful they now felt at a loss how to undeceive
her even in her misery lest the sudden
recurrence happiness might confirm the estrangement
 her reason or might overpower
her enfeebled frame they ventured however
to probe those wounds which they formerly did
not dare to touch for they now had the balm to
pour into them they led the conversation to
those topics which they had hitherto shunned 
and endeavoured to ascertain the current her
thoughts in those varying moods that had formerly
perplexed them they found however
that her mind was even more affected than they
had imagined all her ideas were confused and
wandering her bright and cheerful moods
which now grew seldom than ever were all
 annette delamere
the effects mental delusion at such times
she had no recollection her lover's having
been in danger but was only anticipating his
arrival when the winter has passed away
said she and the trees put on their blossoms
and the swallow comes back over the sea he
will return when she was drooping and desponding
it was in vain to remind her what she
had said in her gayer moments and to assure
her that eugene would indeed return shortly
she wept on in silence and appeared insensible to
their words but at times her agitation became
violent when she would upbraid herself with
having driven eugene from his mother and
brought sorrow on her gray hairs her mind
admitted but one leading idea at a time which
nothing could divert or efface or if they ever
succeeded in interrupting the current her fancy
it only became the more incoherent and increased
the feverishness that preyed upon both mind
and body her friends felt more alarm for her
than ever for they feared that her senses were
annette delamere 
irrecoverably gone and her constitution completely
undermined
in the mean time eugene returned to the village
he was violently affected when the story
 annette was told him with bitterness 
heart he upbraided his own rashness and infatuation
that had hurried him away from her and
accused himself as the author all her woes
his mother would describe to him all the anguish
and remorse poor annette the tenderness
with which she clung to her and endeavoured
even in the midst her insanity to
console her for the loss her son and the
touching expressions affection that were
mingled with her most incoherent wanderings
 thought until his feelings would be wound
up to agony and he would intreat her to desist
from the recital they did not dare as yet to
bring him into annette's sight but he was permitted
to see her when she was sleeping the
tears streamed down his sunburnt cheeks as he
contemplated the ravages which grief and malady
had made and his heart swelled almost to
 annette delamere
breaking as he beheld round her neck the very
braid hair which she once gave him in token
 girlish affection and which he had returned
to her in anger
at length the physician that attended her determined
to adventure upon an experiment to
take advantage one those cheerful moods
when her mind was visited by hope and to endeavour
to engraft as it were the reality upon
the delusions her fancy these moods had
now become very rare for nature was sinking
under the continual pressure her mental
malady and the principle reaction was daily
growing weaker every effort was tried to
bring on a cheerful interval the kind several
 her most favourite companions were kept
continually about her they chatted gayly 
they laughed and sang and danced but annette
reclined with languid frame and hollow
eye and took no part in their gayety at length
the winter was gone the trees put forth their
leaves the swallow began to build in the eaves
 the house and the robin and wren piped all
annette delamere 
day beneath the window annette's spirits gradually
revived she began to deck her person
with unusual care and bringing forth a basket 
artificial flowers she went to work to wreathe
a bridal chaplet white roses her companions
asked her why she prepared the chaplet
 what said she with a smile have
you not noticed the trees putting on their wedding
dresses blossoms has not the swallow
flown back over the sea do you not know that
the time is come for eugene to return that he
will be home tomorrow and that on sunday
we are to be married 
her words were reported to the physician
and he seized on them at once he directed
that her idea should be encouraged and acted
upon her words were echoed through the
house every one talked the return eugene
as a matter course they congratulated
her upon her approaching happiness and assisted
her in her preparations the next morning
the same theme was resumed she was dressed
out to receive her lover every bosom fluttered
vol n 
 annette delamere
with anxiety a cabriolet drove into the village
 eugene is coming was the cry she
saw him alight at the door and rushed with a
shriek into his arms
her friends trembled for the result this
critical experiment but she did not sink under
it for her fancy had prepared her for his return
she was as one in a dream to whom a tide 
unlocked for prosperity that would have overwhelmed
his waking reason seems but the natural
current circumstances her conversation
however showed that her senses were
wandering there was an absolute forgetfulness
 all past sorrow a wild and feverish
gayety that at times was incoherent
the next morning she awoke languid and exhausted
all the occurrences the preceding
day had passed away from her mind as though
they had been the mere illusions her fancy
she rose melancholy and abstracted and as she
dressed herself was heard to sing one her
plaintive ballads when she entered the parlour
her eyes were swoln with weeping shea

annette delamere 
heard eugene's voice without and started she
passed her hand across her forehead and stood
musing like one endeavouring to recall a dream
eugene entered the room and advanced towards
her she looked at him with an eager searching
look murmured some indistinct words and before
he could reach her sunk upon the floor
she relapsed into a wild and unsettled state 
mind butnow that the first shock was over the
physician ordered that eugene should keep continually
in her sight sometimes she did not
know him at other times she would talk to him
as if he were going to sea and would implore
him not to part from her in anger and when he
was not present she would speak him as buried
in the ocean and would sit with clasped hands
looking upon the ground the picture despair

as the agitation her feelings subsided and
her frame recovered from the shock which it
had received she became more placid and coherent
eugene kept almost continually near her
he formed the real object round which her 
annette delamere
tered ideas once more gathered and which linked
them once mor with the realities life but
her changeful disorder now appeared to take a
new turn she became languid and inert and
would sit for hours silent and almost in a state 
lethargy if roused from this stupor it seemed
as if her mind would make some attempts to
follow up a train thought but soon became
confused she would regard every one that approached
her with an anxious and inquiring eye
that seemed continually to disappoint itself
sometimes as her lover sat holding her hand she
would look pensively in his face without saying
a word until his heart was overcome and after
these transient fits intellectual exertion she
would sink again into lethargy
by degrees this stupor increased her mind
appeared to have subsided into a stagnant and
almost deathlike calm for the greater part 
the time her eyes were closed her face almost
as fixed and passionless as that a
corpse she no longer took any notice 
surrounding objects there was an awfulness
annette delamere 
in this tranquillity that filled her friends with
apprehension the physician ordered that she
should be kept perfectly quiet or that if she
evinced any agitation she should be gently lulled
like a child by some favourite tune
she remained in this state for hours hardly
seeming to breathe and apparently sinking into
the sleep death her chamber was profoundly
still the attendants moved about it
with noiseless tread every thing was communicated
by signs and whispers her lover sat by
her side watching her with painful anxiety and
fearing that every breath which stole from her
pale lips would be the last
at length she heaved a deep sigh and from
some convulsive motions appeared to be troubled
in her sleep her agitation increased accompanied
by an indistinct moaning one 
her companions remembering the physician's instructions
endeavoured to lull her by singing
in a low voice a tender little air which was a
particular favourite annette's probably it
had some connection in her mind with her story 
 annette delamere
for every fond girl has some ditty the kind
linked in her thoughts with sweet and sad remembrances

as she sang the agitation annette subsided
a streak faint colour came into her
cheeks her eyelids became swoln with rising
tears w r which trembled there for a moment and
then stealing forth coursed down her pallid
cheek when the song was ended she opened
her eyes and looked about her as one awaking
in a strange place
oh eugene eugene said she it seems
as if i have had a long and dismal dream what
has happened and what has been the matter
with me 
the questions were embarrassing and before
they could be answered the physician who was
in the next room entered she took him by the
hand looked up in his face and made the same
inquiry he endeavoured to put her off with
some evasive answer no no cried she
i know i've been ill and i have been dreaming
strangely i thought eugene had left us and
annette delamere 
that he had gone to sea and that and that he
was drowned but he has been to sea added
she earnestly as recollection kept flashing
upon her and he has been wrecked and we
were all so wretched and he came home again
one bright morning and oh said she
pressing her hand against her forehead with a
sickly smile i see how it is all has not been
right here i begin to recollect but it is all
past now eugene is here and his mother is
happy and we shall never never part again
shall we eugene 
she sunk back in her chair exhausted the
tears streamed down her cheeks her companions
hovered round her not knowing what to
make this sudden dawn reason her lover
sobbed aloud she opened her eyes again and
looked upon them with an air the sweetest
acknowledgment you are all so good to me 
said she faintly
the physician drew the father aside your
daughter's mind is restored said he she is
sensible that she has been deranged she is
 annette delamere
growing conscious the past and conscious 
the present all that now remains is to keep
her calm and quiet until her health is reesta
blushed and then let her be married in god's
name 
the wedding took place said the good
priest but a short time since they were hereat
the last fete during their honey moon and a
handsomer and happier couple was not to be seen
as they danced under yonder trees the young
man his wife and mother now live on a fine
farm at pont l'eveque and that model a
ship which you see yonder with white flowers
wreathed round it is annette's offering thanks
to our lady grace for having listened to her
prayers and protected her lover in the hour 
peril
annette delamere 
the captain having finished there was a
momentary silence the tender hearted lady
lillycraft who knew the story by heart had led
the way in weeping and indeed had often begun
to shed tears before they had come to the
right place the fair julia was a little flurried
at the passage where wedding preparations were
mentioned but the auditor most affected was the
simple phoebe wilkins she had gradually
dropt her work in her lap and sat sobbing through
the latter part the story until towards the 
when the happy reverse had nearly produced
another scene hysterics go take this
case to my room again child said lady lillycraft
kindly and don't cry so much
i won't an't please your ladyship if i can
help it but i'm glad they made all up again
and were married
by the way the case this lovelorn damsel
begins to make some talk in the household esvol
n 
 annette delamere
specially among certain little ladies not far in
their teens whom she has made confidants
she is a great favourite with them all but
particularly so since she has confided to them
her love secrets
they enter into her concerns with all the
violent zeal and overwhelming sympathy with
which little boarding school ladies engage in the
politics a love affair i have noticed them
frequently clustering about her in private conferences
 or walking up and down the garden
terrace under my window listening to some long
and dolorous story her afflictions which
i could now and then distinguish the ever recurring
phrases says he and says she
i accidentally interrupted one these little
councils war when they were all huddled together
under a tree and seemed to be earnestly
considering some interesting document
the flutter at my approach showed that there
were some secrets under discussion and i observed
the disconsolate phoebe crumpling into
her bosom either a love letter or an old valentine
and brushing away the tears from her cheeks
annette delamere 
the girl is a good girl a soft melting nature
and shows her concern at the cruelty 
her lover only in tears and drooping looks but
with the little ladies who have espoused her
cause it sparkles up into fiery indignation and
i have noticed on sunday many a glance
darted at the pew the tibbets enough to
melt down the silver buttons on old ready mos
jacket
the c u l p r i t 
from fire from water and all things amiss
deliver the house an honest justice
the widow
the serenity the hall has been suddenly
interrupted by a very important occurrence in
the course this morning a posse villagers
was seen trooping up the avenue with boys
shouting in advance as it drew near we perceived
ready money jack tibbets striding
along wielding his cudgel in one hand and
with the other grasping the collar a tall fellow
whom on still nearer approach we recognised
for the redoubtable gipsy hero starlight
tom he was now however completely
the culprit 
cowed and crestfallen and his courage seemed
to have quailed in the iron gripe the lionhearted
jack
the whole gang gipsy women and children
came draggling in the rear some in tears others
making a violent clamour about the ears old
ready money who however trudged on in
silence with his prey heeding their abuse as little
as a hawk that has pounced upon a barn
door hero regards the outcries and cackling 
his whole feathered seraglio
he had passed through the village on his was
to the hall and course had made a great
sensation in that most excitable place where
every event is a matter gaze and gossip the
report had circulated like wildfire that old gibbets
had taken starlight tom prisoner the
ale drinkers forthwith abandoned the tap room
slingsbyby's school broke loose without waiting to
be dismissed and masters and boys swelled the
tide that came rolling at the heels old ready
money and his captive the uproar increased
as they approached the hall it aroused the
the culprit
whole garrison dogs and the crew hangers
on the great mastiff barked from the dog
house the stag hound and the greyhound and
the spaniel came barking from the hall door and
my lady lillycraft's little dogs barked from the
parlour windows i remarked however that
the gipsy dogs made no reply to all these menaces
and insults but crept close to the gang
looking round with a guilty poaching air and
now and then glancing up a dubious eye to their
owners which shows that the moral characters
even dogs may be ruined by bad company 
when the throng reached the front the
house they were brought to a halt by a kind 
advanced guard composed old christy the
gamekeeper and two or three servants the
house who had been brought out by the noise
the common herd the village fell back with
respect the boys were driven back by old
christy and his compeers while ready money
jack maintained his ground and his hold the
prisoner and was surrounded by the tailor the
schoolmaster and several other dignitaries the
the culprit
village and by the clamorous brood gipsies
who were neither to be silenced nor intimidated
by this time the whole household were brought
to the doors and windows and the squire to the
portal an audience was demanded by ready
money jack who had detected the prisoner in
the very act sheep stealing on his domains
and had borne him off to be examined before
the squire who is in the commission the
peace
a kind tribunal was immediately held in
the servant's hall a large chamber with a stone
floor and a long table in the centre at one 
 which just under an enormous clock was
placed the squire's chair justice while master
simon took his place at the table as clerk 
the court an attempt had been made by old
christy to keep out the gipsy gang but in vain 
and they with the village worthies and the
household half filled the hall the old housekeeper
and the butler were in a panic at this dangerous
irruption they hurried away all the
valuable things and portable articles that were at
 the culprit
hand and even kept a dragon watch on the gipsies
lest they should carry off the house clock or
the deal table
old christy and his faithful coadjutor the
gamekeeper acted as constables to guard the
prisoner and appeared to triumph in having at
last got this terrible nightwalking offender in
their clutches by the bye i am inclined to suspect
that the old huntsman bore some peevish
recollection having been handled rather roughly
by the gipsy in the chance medley affray 
mayday
silence was now commanded by master simon
but it was difficult to be enforced in such a mostly
assemblage there was a continual snarling
and yelping dogs and as fast as it was quelled
in one corner it broke out in another the
poor gipsy curs who like arrant thieves could
not hold up their heads in an honest house were
worried and insulted by the gentlemen dogs 
the establishment without offering to make resistance
 the very curs my lady lillycraft
bullied them with impunity
the culprit 
the examination was conducted with great
mildness and indulgence by the squire partly
from the kindness his nature and partly i
suspect because his heart yearned towards the
culprit who as i have before mentioned had
found great favour in his eyes from the skill he
had at various times displayed in archery morrice
dancing and other obsolete accomplishments
proofs however were too strong ready
money jack told his story in a straight forward
independent way nothing daunted by the presence
in which he found himself he had suffered
from various depredations on his sheepfold
and poultry yard and had at length kept watch
and caught the delinquent in the very act 
making off with a sheep on his shoulders
tibbets was repeatedly interrupted in the
course his testimony by the culprit's mother
a furious old beldame with an insufferable tongue
and who in fact was several times on the point
 flying at him tooth and nail the wife 
the prisoner whom i am told he does not beat
above half a dozen times a week completely in
vol 
 the culprit
treated lady lillycraft in her husband's behalf
by her tears and supplications and several the
other gipsy women were awakening strong sympathy
among the young girls and maid servants
in the back ground the pretty black eyed
gipsy girl whom i have mentioned on a former
occasion as the sybil that read the fortunes 
the general now endeavoured to wheedle that
doughty warrior into their interests and even
made some approaches to her old acquaintance
master simon but was repelled by the latter
with all the dignity office having assumed a
gravity and importance suitable to the occasion
i was a little surprised at first to find honest
slingsbyby the schoolmaster rather opposed to his
old crony tibbets and coming forward as a
kind advocate for the accused it seems that
he had taken compassion on the forlorn fortunes
 starlight tom arid had been trying his eloquence
in his favour the whole way from the village
but without effect during the examination
 ready money jack also slingsbyby had
stood like dejected pity at his side seeking
the culprit 
every now and then by a soft word to soothe any
exacerbation his ire or to qualify any harsh
expression he now ventured to make a few
observations to the squire in palliation the
delinquent's offences but poor slingsbyby spoke
more from the heart than the head and was evidently
actuated merely by a general sympathy
for any poor devil in trouble and a liberal toleration
for all kinds vagabond existence
the ladies too large and small with the
kindheartedness the sex were zealous on the
side mercy and interceded strenuously with
the squire insomuch that the prisoner finding
himself unexpectedly surrounded by active
friends once more reared his crest and seemed
disposed for a time to put on the airs injured
innocence the squire however with all his
benevolence heart and his lurking weakness
towards the prisoner was too conscientious
to swerve from the strict path justice there
was abundant concurring testimony that made
the proof guilt incontrovertible and starlight
tom's mittimus was made out accordingly
 the culprit
the sympathy the ladies was now greater
than ever they even made some attempts to
mollify the ire ready money jack but that
sturdy potentate had been too much incensed
by the repeated incursions that had been made
into his territories by the predatory band 
starlight tom and he was resolved he said
to drive the garment reptiles out the
neighbourhood to avoid all further importunities
as soon as the mittimus was made out
he girded up his loins and strode back to his
seat empire accompanied by his interceding
friend slingsbyby and followed by a detachment
 the gipsy gang who hung on his rear assailing
him with mingled prayers and declarations

the question now was how to dispose the
prisoner a matter great moment in this
peaceful establishment where so formidable a
character as starlight torn was like a hawk
entrapped in a dove cote as the hubbub and
examination had occupied a considerable time
it was too late in the day to send him to the
the culprit 
county prison and that the village was sadly
out repair from long want occupation
old christy who took great interest in the affair
proposed that the culprit should be committed
for the night to an upper loft a kind tower
in one the outhouses where he and the
gamekeeper would mount guard after much
deliberation this measure was adopted the premises
in question were examined and made secure
and christy and his trusty ally the one
armed with a fowling piece the other with an
ancient blunderbuss turned out as sentries to
keep watch over this donjon keep
such is the momentous affair that has just
taken place and it is an event too great moment
in this quiet little world not to turn it
completely topsyturvy labour is at a stand
the house has been a scene confusion the
whole evening the mansion has been beleaguered
by gipsy women with their children on
their backs wailing and lamenting while the old
virago a mother has cruised up and down before
the house shaking her head and muttering
 the culprit
to herself and now and then breaking into a
paroxysm rage brandishing her fist at the
hall and denouncing ill luck upon ready money
jack and even upon the squire himself
lady lillycraft has given repeated audiences
to the culprit's weeping wife at the hall door and
the servant maids have stole out to confer with
the gipsy women under the trees as to the
little ladies the family they are all outrageous
at ready money jack whom they look upon
in the light a tyrannical giant fairy tale
phoebe wilkins contrary to her usual nature
is the only female that is pitiless in this affair
she thinks mr tibbets quite in the right and
thinks the gipsies deserve to be punished severely
for meddling with the sheep the tibbets
in the mean time the females the family
have evinced all the provident kindness the
sex ever ready to soothe and succour the distressed
right or wrong lady lillycraft has had a
mattress taken to the outhouse and comforts
and delicacies all kinds have been taken to the
prisoner even the little girls have sent their
the culprit 
cakes and sweetmeats so that i'll warrant the
vagabond has never fared so well in his life before
old christy it is true looks upon everything
with a waryee struts about with his
blunderbuss with the air a veteran campaigner
keeps every one at bay and will hardly allow
himself to be spoken to the gipsy women
dare not come within gunshot and every tatterdemalion
 a boy has been frightened from the
park the old fellow is determined to lodge
starlight tom in prison with his own hands
and hopes he says to see one the poaching
crew made an example 
i doubt after all whether the worthy squire
is not the greatest sufferer in the whole affair
his honourable sense duty obliges him to be
rigid but the overflowing kindness his nature
makes this a grievous trial to him he is
not accustomed to have such demands upon his
justice in his truly patriarchal domain and it
wounds his benevolent spirit that while prosperity
and happiness are flowing in thus bounds
the culprit
teouslj upon him he should have to inflict
misery upon fellow being
he has been troubled and cast down the whole
evening took leave the family on going to
bed with a sigh instead his usual hearty and
affectionate tone and will in all probability have
a far more sleepless night than his prisoner indeed
this unlucky affair has cast a damp upon the
whole household as there appears to be an
universal opinion that the unlucky culprit will
come to the gallows
morning the clouds last evening are
all blown over a load has been taken from
the squire's heart and every face is once more
in smiles the gamekeeper made his appearance
at an early hour completely shamefaced
and chapfallen starlight tom had made his
escape in the night how he had got out the
loft no one could tell the devil must have assisted
him old christy was so mortified that
he would not show his face but had shut himself
up in his strong hold at the dogkennel and
the culprit 
would not be spoken with what has particularly
relieved the squire is that there is very
little likelihood the culprit's being retaken
having gone off on one the old gentleman's
best hunters
vol 
the historian
i have forborne to recount various tales which
have been told during the evenings at the hall
because some them were rather hackneyed
and tedious and others i did not feel warranted
in betraying into print i was suddenly startled
lately by a call from the squire to furnish a story
in my turn and having been a profound listener
to those others i could not in conscience refuse
 so i begged leave to read a manuscript tale
from the pen the late mr heinrich knickerbocker
the historian new york
as some curiosity was expressed about the author
i had to explain that he was a native 
new york a descendant one the ancient
dutch families that originally settled that province
and remained there after it was taken
possession by the english in that
the historian s
the descendants these dutch families still remained
in villages and neighbourhoods in various
parts the country retaining with singular
fidelity the dresses manners and even language
 their ancestors and forming a very distinct
and curious feature in the population the
state
that mr knickerbocker had written a history
 his native city comprising the reign the
three first governors who held a delegated sway
under the hogen moyens holland that in
this the worthy little dutchman had displayed
great historical research and a wonderful sense
 the dignity his subject but that his work
had been so little understood as to be pronounced
a mere work humour satirizing the follies
 the times in politics and morals and giving
whimsical views human nature
that among the papers left behind him were
several tales a lighter nature apparently
thrown together from materials which he had
gathered during his profound researches for his
history and which he seemed to have thrown
 the historian
by with neglect as unworthy publication
that these had fallen into my hands by an accident
which it was needless to mention and one
 those stories with its prelude in the words 
mr knickerbocker i now undertook to read
by way acquitting myself the debt which
i owed to the other storytellers in company
the haunted house
from the mss the late heinrich knickerbocker
formerly almost every place had a house this kind if a house
was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic
manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such
as murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a
mark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the habitation a
bourne s antiquities
in the neighbourhood the ancient city 
manhattoes there stood not very many years
since an old mansion which when i was a boy
went by the name the haunted house it was
one the very few remains the architecture
 the early dutch settlers and must have been
a house some consequence at the time when
it was built it consisted a centre and two
wings the gable ends which were shaped
like stairs it was built partly wood and
 the haunted house
partly small dutch bricks such as the worthy
colonists brought with them from holland 
before they discovered that bricks could be
manufactured elsewhere the house stood remote
from the road in the centre a large
field with an avenue old locust trees leading
up to it several which had been shivered
by lightning and two or three blown down
a few apple trees grew straggling about the
field there were traces also what had been
a kitchen garden but the fences were broken
down the vegetables had disappeared or had
grown wild and turned to little better than
weeds with here and there a ragged rose bush
or a tall sunflower shooting up from among the
brambles and hanging its head sorrowfully as
if contemplating the desolation around it part
 the roof the old house had fallen in the
windows were shattered the pannels the
doors broken and mended with rough boards 
and there were two rusty weathercocks at the
ends the house which made a great jingling
acacias
the haunted house 
and whistling as they whirled about but always
poiutecl wrong the appearance the whole
was forlorn and desolate at the best times 
but in unruly weather the howling the wind
about the crazy old mansion the screeching 
the weathercocks the slamming and banging
 a few loose window shutters had altogether
so wild and dreary an effect that the neighbourhood
stood perfectly in awe the place and
pronounced it the rendezvous hobgoblins i
recollect the old building well for i recollect
how many times when an idle unlucky urchin
i have prowled round its precincts with some
 my graceless companions on holyday afternoons
when out on a freebooting cruise among
the orchards
there was a tree standing near the house
that bore the most beautiful and tempting fruit 
but then it was on enchanted ground for the
place was so charmed by frightful stories that we
dreaded to approach it sometimes we would
venture in a body and get near the hesperian
tree keeping an eye upon the old mansion and
 the haunted house
darting fearful glances into its shattered windows
 when just as we were about tf seize
upon our prize an exclamation from some one
 the gang or an accidental noise would throw
us all into a panic and we wo old scamper headlong
from the place nor ever stop until we had
got quite into the road then there were sure
to be a host anecdotes told about strange
cries and groans or some hideous face suddenly
seen staring out one the windows
by degrees we ceased to venture into these lonely
grounds but would stand at a distance and
throw stones at the building and there was something
fearfully pleasing in the sound as they
rattled along the roof or sometimes struck some
jingling fragments glass out the windows
the origin the house was lost in the obscurity
that covers the early period the province
whilst under the government their high
mightiness the states general some reported
it to have been a country residence wilhelm
kieft commonly called the testy one 
the dutch governors newamsterdam others
the haunted house 
said that it had been built by a naval commander
who served under van tromp and who on
being disappointed preferment retired from
the service in disgust became a philosopher
through sheer spire and brought over all his
wealth to the province that he might live according
to his humour and despise the world the
reason its having fallen to decay was likewise
a matter dispute some said that it was in
chancery and had already cost more than its
worth in legal expenses but the most current
and course the most probable account was
that it was haunted and that nobody could live
quietly in it there can in fact be very little
doubt that this last was the case there were so
many corroborating stories to prove it riot an
old woman in the neighbourhood but could furnish
at least a score there was a gray headed
curmudgeon a negro that lived hard by who
had a whole budget them to tell many 
which had happened to himself
i recollect many a time stopping with my
vol n 
 the haunted house
schoolmates and getting him to relate some
the old crone lived in a hovel in the midst a
small patch potatoes and indian corn which
his master had given him on setting him free
he would come to us with his hoe in his hand
and as we sat perched like a row swallows
on the rail the fence in the mellow twilight
 a summer evening he would tell us such
fearful stories accompanied by such awful
rolling his white eyes that we wre almost
afraid our own footsteps as we returned home
afterwards in the dark
poor old pompey many years are past since
he died and went to keep company with the
ghosts he was so fond talking about
he was buried in a corner his own little
ito patch the plough soon passed over his
ive and levelled it with the rest the field
and nobody thought any more the gray headed
negro by singular chance i was strolling in
that neighbourhood several years afterwards
when i had grown up to be a young man and i
found a knot gossips speculating on a skull
the haunted house 
which had just been turned up by a ploughshare

they course determined it to be the remains
 some one that had been murdered and
they had raked up with it some the traditionary
tales the haunted house i knew it at
once to be the relique poor pompey but i
held my tongue for i am too considerate 
other people's enjoyment ever to mar a story 
a ghost or a murder i took care however to
see the bones my old friend once more buried
in a place where they were not likely to be disturbed
as i sat on the turf and watched the
interment i fell into a long conversation with an
old gentleman the neighbourhood john fosse
windermere a pleasant gossiping man whose
whole life was spent in hearing and telling the
news the province he recollected old poi
pey and his stories about the haunted house 
but he assured me he could give me one still
more strange than any that pompey had related 
and on my expressing a great curiosity to hear it
he sat down beside me on the turf and told the
the haunted house
following tale i have endeavoured to give it as
nearly as possible in his words but it is now
many years since and i am grown old and my
memory is not over good cannot therefore
vouch for the language but i am always scrupulous
as to facts

old play the tale a tub
in the early times the province newyork
while it groaned under the tyranny the
english governor lord carbury who carried
his cruelties toward the dutch inhabitants so jar
as to allow no dominie nor schoolmaster to oj
cite in their language without his special license
 about this time there lived in the jolly little
old city the manhattoes a kind motherly
dame known by the name dame heyliger
she was the widow a dutch sea captain
 adolph heyliger
who died suddenly a fever in consequence 
working too hard and eating too heartily at
the time when all the inhabitants turned out ina
panic to fortify the place against the invasion
 a small french privateer he left her with
very little money and one infant son the only
survivor several children the good woman
had need much management to make both
ends meet and keep up a decent appearance
however as her husband had fallen a victim to
his zeal for the public safety it was universally
agreed that something ought to be done for the
widow and on the hopes this something
she lived very tolerably for some years in the
mean time every body pitied and spoke well 
her and that helped along
she lived in a small house in a small street
called garden street very probably from a
garden which may have flourished there sometime
or other as her necessities every year
grew greater and the talk the public about
doing something for her grew less she had

adolph heyliger 
to cast about for some mode doing something
for herself by way helping out her slender
means and maintaining her independence 
which she was somewhat tenacious
living in a mercantile town she had caught
something the spirit and determined to venture
a little in the great lottery commerce
on a sudden therefore to the great surprise 
the street there appeared at her window a grand
array gingerbread kings and queens with
their arms stuck akimbo after the invariable
royal manner there were also several broken
tumblers some filled with sugar plumbs some
with marbles there were moreover cakes 
various kinds and barley sugar and holland
dolls and wooden horses with here and there
gilt covered picture books and now and then a
skein thread or a dangling pound candle
at the door the house sat the good old
dame's cat a decent demure looking personage
that seemed to scan every body that passed to
criticise their dress and now and then to stretch
her neck and look out with sudden curiosity to
adolph heyliger
see what was going on at the other the
street but if by chance any idle vagabond dog
came by and offered to be uncivil hoitytoity 
how she would bristle up and growl and spit
and strike out her paws she was as indignant
as ever was an ancient and ugly spinster on the
approach some graceless profligate
but though the good woman had to comedown
to those humble means subsistence yet
she still kept up a feeling family pride having
descended from the vanderspiegels amsterdam
 and she had the family arms painted
and framed and hung over her mantlepiece she
vas in truth much respected by all the poorer
people the place her house was quite a resort
 the old wives the neighbourhood they
would drop in there a winter's afternoon as
le sat knitting on one side her fireplace her
cat purring on the other and the teakettle singing
before it and they would gossip with her
until late in the evening there was always an
armchair for old peter de groodt sometimes
called long peter and sometimes peter longlegs
bolph heyliger 
the clerk and sexton the little lutheran
church who was her great crony and indeed
the oracle her fireside nay the dominie
himself did not disdain now and then to stop in
converse about the state her mind and take a
glass her especial good cherry brandy indeed
he never failed to call on new year's day
and wish her a happy new year and the good
dame who was a little vain on some points always
piqued herself on giving him as large a cake
as any one in town
i have said that she had one son he was
the child her old age butcould hardly be
called the comfort for all unlucky urchins
dolph heyliger was the most mischievous not
that the whisper was really vicious he was
only full fun and frolick and had that daring
gamesome spirit which is extolled in a rich man's
child but execrated in a poor man's he was
continually getting into scrapes his mother was
incessantly harassed with complaints some
waggish prank which he had played off bills
were sent in for windows that he had broken in
vol it 
s adolph heyligek
a word he had not reached his fourteenth year
before he was pronounced by all the neighbourhood
to be a wicked dog the wickedest dog
in the street nay one old gentleman in a
claret coloured coat with a thin red face and
ferret eyes went so far as to assure dame heytiger
that her son would one day or other come
to the gallows 
yet notwithstanding all this the poor old soul
loved her boy it seemed as though she loved
him the better the worse he behaved and that
he grew more in her favour the more he grew
out favour with the world mothers are
foolish fond hearted beings there's no reasoning
them out their dotage and indeed this
poor woman's child was all that was left to love
her in this world so w e must not think it hard
that she turned a deaf ear to her good friends
who sought to prove to her that dolph must inevitably
come to a halter to do the varlet justice
too he was strongly attached to his parent
he would not willingly have given her pain on
any account and when he had been doing wrong
adolph heyliger 
it was but foe him to catch his poor mother's eye
fixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him to fill
his heart with bitterness and contrition but he
was a heedless youngster and could not for the
life him resist any new temptation to fun and
mischief though quick at his learning whenever
he could be brought to apply himself yet he
was always prone to be led away by idle company
 and would play truant to hunt after bird's
nests to rob orchards or to swim in the hudson

in this way he grew up a tall lubberly boy
and his mother began to be greatly perplexed
what to do with him or how to put him in a
way to do for himself for he had acquired such
an unlucky reputation that no one seemed willing
to employ him many was the consultation
that she held with peter de groodt the clerk
and sexton who was her prime councillor
peter was as much perplexed as herself for he
had no great opinion the boy and thought he
would never come to good he at one time
advised her to send him to sea a piece advice
 adolph heyliger
only given in the most desperate cases but dame
heyliger would not listen to such an idea she
could not think letting dolph go out her
sight she was sitting one day knitting by her
fireside in great perplexity when the sexton
entered with an air unusual vivacity and briskness
he had just come from a funeral it had
been that a boy dolph's years who had
been apprentice to a famous german doctor
who had died a consumption it is true there
had been a whisper that the deceased had been
brought to his by being made the subject 
the doctor's experiments on which he was apt
to try the effects a new compound or a quieting
draught this however it is likely was a
mere scandal at any rate peter de groodt did
not think it worth mentioning though had we
time to philosophize it would be a curious matter
for speculation why a doctor's family is apt
to be so lean and cadaverous and a butcher's so
jolly and rubicund
peter de groodt as i said before entered the
house dame heyliger with unusual alacrity
adolph heyliger 
he was full a bright idea that had popped
into his head at the funeral and over which he
had chuckled as he shovelled the earth into the
grave the doctor's disciple it had occurred
to him thar as the situation the deceased was
vacant at the doctor's it would be the very
place for dolph the boy had parts and could
pound a pestle and run an errand with any boy in
the town and what more was wanted in a student

the suggestion the sage peter was a vision
 glory to the mother she already saw dolphin
her mind's eye with a cane at his nose a
knocker at his door and an m d at the 
 his name one the established dignitaries 
the town 
the matter once undertaken was soon effected
 the sexton had some influence with the
doctor they having had much dealing together
in the way their separate professions and
the very next morning he called and conducted
the urchin clad in his sunday clothes to undergo
 adolph heyliger
the inspection doctor karl lodovich knip
perhausen
they found the doctor seated in an elbow
chair in one corner his study or laboratory
with a large volume in german print before him
he was a short fat man with a dark square
lace rendered more dark by a black velvet cap
he had a little robbed nose not unlike the ace
 spades with a pair spectacles gleaming
on each side his dusky countenance like a
couple bow windows
dolph felt struck with awe on entering into
the presence this learned man and gazed
about him with boyish wonder at the furniture
 this chamber knowledge which appeared
to him almost as the den a magician in the
centre stood a claw footed table with pestle and
mortar phials and galli pots and a pair small
burnished scales at one was a heavy
clothes press turned into a receptacle for drugs
and compounds against which hung the doctor's
hat and cloak and goldheaded cane and on
the top grinned a human scull along the randolph
heyliger 
timepiece were glass vessels holding snakes and
lizards and a human foetus preserved in spirits
a closet the doors which were taken off
contained three whole shelves full books and
some too mighty folio dimensions a collection
the like which dolph had never before
beheld as however the library did not
take up the whole the closet the doctor's
thrifty housekeeper had occupied the rest with
pots pickles and preserves and had hung
about the room among awful implements the
healing art strings red peppers and corpulent
cucumbers carefully preserved for seed
peter de groodt and his protege were received
with great gravity and stateliness by the
doctor who was a very wise dignified little
man and never smiled he surveyed dolph
from head to foot above and under and through
his spectacles and the poor lad's heart quailed as
these great glasses glared on him like two full
moons the doctor heard all that peter de
groodt had to say in favour the youthful candidate
 and then wetting his thumb with the
 adolph belligerent
 his tongue he began deliberately to turnover
page after page the great black volume
before him at length after many hums and
haws and stroking the chin and all that hesitation
and deliberation with which a wise man
proceeds to do what he intended to do from the
very first the doctor agreed to take the lad as a
disciple to give him bed board and clothing
and to instruct him in the healing art in return
for which he was to have his services until his
twentyfirst year behold then our hero all at
once transformed from an unlucky urchin running
wild about the streets to a student medicine
diligently pounding a pestle under the auspices
 the learned doctor karl lodovich
knipperhauseri it was a happy transition for
his fond old mother she was delighted with
the idea her boy's being brought up worthy
 his ancestors and anticipated the day when
he would be able to hold up his head with the
lawyer that lived in the large door opposite or
peradventure with the dominie himself
adolph heyliger 
doctor knipperhausen was a native the palatinate
in germany from whence in company
with many his countrymen he had taken refuge
in england on account religious persecution
he was one nearly three thousand
palatines who came over from england in 
under the protection governor hunter where
the doctor had studied how he had acquired
his medical knowledge and where he had received
his diploma it is hard at present to say
for nobody knew at the time yet it is certain
that his profound skill and abstruse knowledge
were the talk and wonder the common people
far and near his practice was totally different
from that any other physician consisting
in mysterious compounds known only to himself
in the preparing and administering 
which it was said he always consulted the stars
so high an opinion was entertained his skill
particularly by the german and dutch inhabitants
that they always resorted to him in desperate
cases he was one those infallible doctors
that are always effecting sudden and surprise
 
 adolph heyliger
sing cures when the patient has been given up
by all the regular physicians unless as is
shrewdly observed the case has been left too
long before it was put into his hands the
doctor's library was the talk and marvel the
neighbourhood i might almost say the entire
burgh the good people looked with reverence
at a man that had read three whole shelves full
 books and some them too as large as a
family bible there were many disputes among
the members the little lutheran church as
to which was the wisest man the doctor or the
dominie some his admirers even went so far
as to say that he knew more than the governor
himself in a word it was thought that there
was no to his knowledge 
no sooner was dolph received into the doctor's
family than he was put in possession the
lodgings his predecessor it was a garret
room a steep roofed dutch house where the
rain pattered on the shingles and the lightning
gleamed arid the wind piped through the crannies
in stormy weather and where whole troops
adolph heyligeiu 
 hungry rats galloped about like don cossacks
in defiance traps and ratsbane
he was soon up to his ears in medical studies
being employed morning noon and night in
rolling pills filtering tinctures or pounding the
pestle and mortar in one corner the laboratory
 while the doctor would take his seat in
another corner when he had nothing else to door
expected visitors and arrayed in his morning
gown and velvet cap would pore over the contents
 some folio volume it is true that the
regular thumping dolph's pestle or perhaps
the drowsy buzzing the summer flies would
now and then lull the little man into a slumber 
but then his spectacles were always wide awake
and studiously regarding the 
there was another personage in the house
however to whom dolph was obliged to pay
allegiance though a bachelor and a man 
such great dignity and importance yet the doctor
was like many other wise men subject to
petticoat goverment he was completely under
the sway his housekeeper a spare busy
 adolph heyliger
fretting housewife in a little round quilted
german cap with a huge bunch keys jingling
at the girdle an exceedingly long waist
fran use or frow ilsyy as it was pronounced
had accompanied him in his various migrations
from germany to england and from england
to the province managing his establishment
and himself too ruling him it is true with a
gentle hand but carrying a high hand with all
the world beside how she had acquired such
ascendancy i do not pretend to say people
it is true did talk but have not people been
prone to talk ever since the world began who
can tell how women generally contrive to get
the upper hand a husband it is true may
now and then be master in his own house but
who ever knew a bachelor that was not managed
by his housekeeper 
indeed frau ilsyy's power was not confined
to the doctor's household she was one 
those prying gossips that know every one's business
better than they do themselves and
whose allseeing eyes and alltelling tongues
adolph heyliger 
are terrors throughout a neighbourhood nothing
 any moment transpired m the world 
scandal this little burgh but it was kiiown
to frau ilsyy she had her crew cronies
that were perpetually hurrying to her little parlour
with some precious bit news nay she
would sometimes discuss a whole volume secret
history as she held the street door ajar and
gossiped with one those garrulous crones
in the very teeth a december blast
between the doctor and the housekeeper it
may easily be supposed that dolph had a busy
life it as frau f isy kept the keys and literally
ruled the roast it was starvation to offend
her though he found the study her temper
more perplexing even than that medicine
when not busy in the laboratory she kept him
running hither and thither on her own errands 
and on sundays he was obliged to accompany
her to and from church and carry her bible and
many a time has the poor varlet stood shivering
and blowing his fingers or holding his frostbit
ten nose in the church yard while frau ilsyy
 adolph heyliger
and her cronies were huddled together wagging
their heads and tearing some unlucky character
to pieces
with allhis advantages however dolph made
but very slow progress in his art this was no
fault the doctor's certainly for he took unwearied
pains with the lad keeping him close
to the pestle and mortar or on the trot about
town with phials and pillboxes and if he ever
flagged in his industry which he was rather apt
to do the doctor would fly into a passion and
ask him if he ever expected to learn his profession
unless he applied himself closer to the study
the fact is he still retained the fondness for
sport and mischief that had marked his childhood
the habit indeed strengthened with his
years and gained force from being thwarted and
constrained he daily grew more and more untractable
 and lost favour in the eyes both the
doctor and the housekeeper
in the mean time the doctor went on waxing
wealthy and renowned he was famous for his
skill in managing cases not laid down in the
adolph heyliger 
books he had cured several old women and
young girls witchcraft a terrible complaint
nearly as prevalent in the province in those days
as hydrophobia is at present he had even restored
one strapping country girl to perfect health
who had gone so far as to vomit crooked pins
and needles which is considered a desperate
stage the malady it was whispered also
that he was possessed the art preparing
love ponders and many applications had he inconsequence
from lovesick patients both
sexes but all these cases formed the mysterious
part his practice in which according to the
cant phrase secrecy and honour might be
depended on dolph therefore was obliged to
turn out the study when such consultations
occurred though it is said he learnt more the
secrets the art at the key hole than by all the
rest his studies put together
as the doctor increased in wealth he began to
extend his possessions and to look forward like
other great men to the time when he should retire
to the repose a country seat for this
adolph heyligek
purpose he had purchased a farm or as the
dutch settlers called it a bower a few miles
from town it had been the residence a wealthy
family that had returned some time since to
holland a large mansion house stood in the
centre it very much out repair and which
in consequence certain reports had received
the appellation the haunted house either
from these reports or from its actual dreariness
the doctor had found it impossible to get a tenant
and that the place might not fall to ruin
before he could reside in it himself he had placed
a country boor with his family in one wing
with the privilege cultivating the farm on
shares
the doctor now felt all the dignity a landholder
rising within him he had a little the
german pride territory in his composition
and almost looked upon himself as owner a
principality he began to complain the fatigue
 business and was fond riding out
to look at his estate his little expeditions
to his lands were attended with a bustle and paadolph
heyliger 
rade that created a sensation throughout the
neighbourhood his walleyed horse stood stamping
and whisking off the flies for a full hour before
the house then the doctor's saddle bags
would be brought out and adjusted then after
a little while his cloak would be rolled up and
strapped to the saddle then his umbrella would
be buckled to the cloak while in the meantime
a group ragged boys that observant
class beings would gather before the door
at length the doctor would issue forth in a pair
 jack boots that reached above his knees and
a cocked hat flapped down in front as he was
a short fat man he took some time to mount
into the saddle and when there he took sometime
to have the saddle and stirrups properly
adjusted enjoying the wonder and admiration
 the urchin crowd even after he had set
off he would pause in the middle the street
or trot back two or three times to give some
parting orders which were answered by the
housekeeper from the door or dolph from the
study or the black cook from the cellar or the
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
chambermaid from the garret window and
there were generally some last words bawled
after him just as he was turning the corner
the whole neighbourhood would be aroused
by this pomp and circumstance the cobbler
would leave his last the barber would thrust
out his frizzed head with a comb sticking in ita
knot would collect at the grocer's door and
the word would be buzzed from one the
street to the other the doctor's riding out to
his country seat 
these were golden moments for dolph no
sooner was the doctor out sight than pestle
and mortar were abandoned the laboratory was
left to take care itself and the student was
off on some madcap frolick indeed it must be
confessed the youngster as he grew up seemed
in a fair way to fulfil the prediction the old
claret coloured gentleman he was the ringleader
 all holyday sports and midnight gambols
 ready for all kinds mischievous pranks
and harebrained adventure there is nothing
so troublesome as a hero on a small scale or
oolph heyliger 
rather a hero in a small town dolph soon became
the abhorrence all drowsy housekeeping
old citizens who hated noise and had no relish
for waggery the good dames too considered
him as little better than a reprobate 
gathered their daughters under their wings
whenever he approached and pointed him out
as a warning to their sons no one seemed to
hold him in much regard excepting the wild
striplings the place who were captivated by
his openhearted daring manners and the negroes
who always look upon every idle dono
thing youngster as a kind gentleman even
the good peter de groodt who had considered
himself a kind patron the lad began to
despair him and would shake his head dubiously
as he listened to a long complaint the
housekeeper's and sipped a glass her raspberry
brandy
still his mother was not to be wearied out
 her affection by all the waywardness her
boy nor disheartened by the stories his misdeeds
with which her good friends were 
adolph heyliger
annually regaling her she had it is true very
little the pleasure which rich people enjoy
in always hearing their children praised but
she considered all this ill will as a kind persecution
which he suffered and she liked him
the better on that account she saw him growing
up a fine tall good looking youngster and
she looked at him with the secret pride a mother's
heart it was her great desire that dolph
should appear like a gentleman and all the money
she could save went towards helping out
his pocket and his wardrobe she would lookout
 the window after him as he sallied forth
in his best and her heart would yearn with delight
 and once when peter de groodt struck
with the youngster's gallant appearance on a
bright sunday morning observed well after
all dolph does grow a comely fellow the
tear pride started into the mother's eye ah
neighbour neighbour exclaimed she they
may say what they please poor dolph will yet
hold up his head with the best them 
dolph heyliger had now nearly attained his
adolph heyliger 
oneandtwentieth year and the term his
medical studies was just expiring yet it must
be confessed that he knew little more the profession
than when he first entered the doctor's
doors this however could not be from any
want quickness parts for he showed amazing
aptness in mastering other branches 
knowledge which he could only have studied at
intervals he was for instance a sure marksman
and won all the geese and turkeys at christmas
holidays he was a bold rider he was
famous for leaping and wrestling he played tolerably
on the fiddle could swim like a fish
and was the best hand in the whole place at
fives and ninepins
all these accomplishments however procured
him no favour in the eyes the doctor who
grew more and more crabbed and intolerant the
nearer the term apprenticeship approached
frau ilsyy too was forever finding some occasion
to raise a windy tempest about his ears 
and seldom encountered him about the house
without a clatter the tongue so that at length
 adolph heyliger
the jingling her keys as she approached was
to dolph like the ringing the prompter's bell
that gives notice a theatrical thunder storm
nothing but the infinite good humour the
heedless youngster enabled him to bear all this
domestic tyranny without open rebellion it
was evident that the doctor and his housekeeper
were preparing to beat the poor youth out the
nest the moment his term should have expired 
a shorthand mode which the doctor had providing
for useless disciples
indeed the little man had been rendered more
than usually irritable lately in consequence 
various cares and vexations which his country
estate had brought upon him the doctor had
been repeatedly annoyed by the rumours and
tales which prevailed concerning the old mansion
and found it difficult to prevail even upon
the countryman and his family to remain there
rent free every time he rode out to the farm
he was teased by some fresh complaint strange
noises and fearful sights with which the tenants
were disturbed at night and the doctor would
adolph meyliger 
come home fretting arid fuming and vent his
spleen upon the whole household it was indeed
a sore grievance that affected him both in
pride and purse he was threatened with an
absolute loss the profits his property and
then what a blow to his territorial consequence
to be the landlord a haunted house it was
observed however that with all his vexation
the doctor never proposed to sleep in the house
himself nay he could never be prevailed upon
to remain on the premises after dark but made
the best his way for town as soon as the bats
began to flit about in the twilight the fact
was the doctor was a secret believer in ghosts
having passed the early part his life in a country
where they particularly abound and indeed
the story went that when a boy he had
once seen the devil upon the harts mountains
in germany
at length the doctor's vexations on this head
were brought to a crisis one morning as he
sat dozing over a volume in his study he was
 adolph heyliger
suddenly startled from his slumbers by the bustling
in the housekeeper
here's a fine todo cried she as she entered
the room here's claus hopper come
in bag and baggage from the farm and swears
he'll have nothing more to do with it the
whole family have been frightened out their
wits for there's such racketing and rummaging
about the old house that they can't sleep quiet
in their beds
donner und bitten cried the doctor
impatiently will they never have done chattering
about that house what a pack fools
to let a few hungry rats and mice frighten them
out good quarters
nay nay said the housekeeper wagging
her head knowingly and piqued at having a
good ghost story doubted there's more in it
than rats and mice all the neighbourhood talks
about the house and then such sights have
been seen in it peter de groodt tells me that
the family that sold you the house and went to
holland dropped several strange hints about it
adolph heyliger 
and said they wished you joy your bargain 
and you know yourself there's no getting any
family to live in it
peter de groodt's a ninny an old woman
said the doctor peevishly i'll warrant he's
been filling these people's heads full stories
it's just like his nonsense about the ghost that
haunted the church belfry as an excuse for not
ringing the bell that cold night when germanus
brinkerhoff's house was on fire send clans
to me
claus hopper now made his appearance a
simple country lout full awe at finding himself
in the very study dr knipperhausen and
too much embarrassed to enter into much detail
 the matters that had caused his alarm he
stood twirling his hat in one hand resting sometimes
on one leg sometimes on the other looking
occasionally at the doctor and now and then
stealing a fearful glance at the death's head that
seemed ogling him from the top the clothes
press
the doctor tried every means to persuade him
vol 
 adolph heyliger
to return to the farm but all in vain he maintained
a dogged determination on the subject 
and at the close every argument or solicitation
would make the same brief inflexible reply
ici kan night mynheer
the doctor was a little pot and soon hot
his patience was exhausted by these continual
vexations about his estate the stubborn refusal
 claus hopper seemed to him like flat
rebellion his temper suddenly boiled over and
claus was glad to make a rapid retreat to escape
scalding
when the bumpkin got to the housekeeper's
room he found peter de groodt and several other
true believers ready to receive him here he
indemnified himself for the restraint he had
suffered in the study and opened a budget 
stories about the haunted house that astonished
all his hearers the housekeeper believed them
all if it was only to spite the doctor for having
received her intelligence so uncourteous peter
de groodt matched them with many a wonderful
legend the times the dutch dynasty and
adolph heyliger 
 the devil's stepping stones and the pirate
that was hanged at gibbet island and continued
to swing there at night long after the gallows
was taken down and the ghost the unfortunate
german lesser who was hanged for
treason which haunted the old fort and the government
house the gossiping knot dispersed
each charged with direful intelligence the
sexton disburdened himself at a vestry meeting
that was held that very day and the black
cook forsook her kitchen and spent half the
day at the street pump that gossiping place 
servants dealing forth the news to all that came
for water in a little while the whole town was
in a buzz with tales about the haunted house
some said that claus hopper had seen the
devil while others hinted that the house was
haunted by the ghosts some the patients
which the doctor had physicked out the
world and that was the reason why he did not
venture to live in it himself
all this put the little doctor in a terrible fume
he threatened vengeance on any one who
 adolph heyliger
should affect the value his property by exciting
popular prejudices he complained loud
 thus being in a manner dispossessed his
territories by mere bugbears but he secretly
determined to have the house exorcised by the
dominie
great was his relief therefore when in the
midst his perplexities dolph stepped forward
and undertook to garrison the haunted house
the youngster had been listening to all the stones
 claus hopper and peter de groodt he
was fond adventure he loved the marvellous
 and his imagination had become quite excited
by these tales wonder besides he had
led such an uncomfortable life at the doctor's
being subjected to the intolerable thraldom 
early hours that he was delighted at the prospect
 having a house to himself even though it
should be a haunted one his offer was eagerly
accepted and it was determined that he should
mount guard that very night his only stipulation
was that the enterprize should be kept secret
from his mother for he knew the poor soul
adolph heyliger 
would not sleep a wink if she knew that her son
was waging war with the powers darkness
when night came on he set out on this perilous
expedition the old black cook his only
friend in the household had provided him with
a little mess for supper and a rush light and
she tied round his neck an amulet given herby
an african conjuror as a charm against evil
spirits dolph was escorted on his way by the
doctor and peter de groodt who had agreed to
accompany him to the house and to see him safe
lodged
the night was overcast and it was very dark
when they arrived at the grounds which surrounded
the mansion the sexton led the way
with a lanthorn as they walked along the avenue
 acacias the fitful light catching from
bush to bush and tree to tree often startled the
doughty peter and made him fall back upon his
followers and the doctor grappled still closer
hold dolph's arm observing that the ground
was very slippery and uneven at one time they
were nearly put to total rout by a bat which
c adolph heyliger
came flitting about the lanthorn and the notes
 the insects from the trees and the frogs from
a neighbouring pond formed a most drowsy and
doleful concert
the front door the mansion opened with a
grating sound that made the doctor turn pale
they entered a tolerably large hall such as is
common in american country houses to serve
for sitting rooms in warm weather from hence
they went up a wide staircase that groaned and
creaked as they trod every step making its particular
note like the key a harpsichord this
led to another hall on the second story from
whence they entered the room where dolph was
to sleep it was large and scantily furnished
the shutters were closed but as they were
much shattered there was not want a circulation
 air it appeared to have been that sacred
chamber known among dutch housewives
by the name the best bed room which is
the best furnished but in which scarce any body
is ever permitted to sleep its splendour however
was all at an a few broken articles
adolph heyliger 
 furniture were about the walls and in the
centre the room was a heavy deal table and
a large arm chair both which had the look 
being coeval with the mansion the fireplace
was wide and had been faced with dutch tiles
representing scripture stories but several 
them had fallen out their places and lay shattered
about the hearth
the sexton had lit the rush light and the doctor
looking fearfully about the room was just
exhorting dolph to be good cheer and to
pluck up a stout heart when a noise in the chimney
like voices and struggling struck a sudden
panic into the sexton he took to his
heels with the lanthorn the doctor followed
hard after him the stairs groaned and whistled
as they hurried down increasing their agitation
and speed by its noises the front door slammed
after them and dolph heard them scrambling
down the avenue till the sound their feet
was lost in the distance that he did not join in
this precipitate retreat might have been owing
to his possessing a little more courage than his
 adolph heylger
companions or perhaps that he had caught a
glimpse the cause their dismay in a nest
 chimney swallows that came tumbling down
into the fireplace
being now left to himself he secured the front
door by a strong bolt and bar and having seen
that the other entrances were fastened he returned
to his desolate chamber having made his
supper from the basket which the good old cook
had provided he locked the chamber door and
retired to rest on a mattress in one corner the
night was calm and still and nothing broke
upon the profound quiet but the lonely chirping
 a cricket from the chimney a distant chamber
the rush light which stood in the centre
 the deal table shed a feeble yellow ray dimly
illumining the chamber and making uncouth
shapes and shadows on the walls from the clothes
which dolph had thrown over a chair
with all his boldness heart there was something
subduing in this desolate scene and he
felt his spirits flag within him as he lay on his
hard bed and gazed about the room he was
adolph heyligeh 
turning over in his mind his idle habits his
doubtful prospects and now and then heaving
a heavy sigh as he thought on his poor old mother
 for there is nothing like the silence and
loneliness night to bring dark shadows over
the brightest mind by and bye he thought he
heard a sound as if some one was walking below
stairs he listened and distinctly heard a step
on the great staircase it approached solemnly
and slowly tramp tramp tramp it was
evidently the tread some heavy personage 
and yet how could he have got into the house
without making a noise he had examined all
the fastenings and was certain that every entrance
was secured still the steps advanced
tramp tramp tramp it was evident that
the person approaching could not be a robber 
the step was too loud and deliberate a robber's
would be either stealthy or precipitate and
now the footsteps had ascended the staircase 
they were slowly advancing along the passage
resounding through the silent and empty apartments
the very cricket had ceased its means
 
 adolph heyliger
holy note and nothing interrupted their awful
distinctness the door which had been locked
on the inside slowly swung open as if self moved
the footsteps entered the room but no one
was to be seen they passed slowly and audibly
across it tramp tramp tramp but whatever
made the sound was invisible dolph rubbed
his eves and stared about him he could see
to every part the dimly lighted chamber all
was vacant yet still he heard these mysterious
footsteps solemnly walking about the chamber
they ceased and all was dead silence there
was something more appalling in this invisible
visitation than there would have been in anything
that addressed itself to the eyesight it
was awfully vague and indefinite he felt his
heart beat hard against his ribs a cold sweat
broke out upon his forehead he lay for sometime
in a state violent agitation nothing
however occurred to increase his alarm his
light gradually burnt down into the socket and
he felt asleep when he awoke it was broad
daylight the sun was peering through the
adolph heyliqer
cracks the window shutters and the birds
were merrily singing about the house the
bright cheery day soon put to flight all the terrors
 the preceding night dolph laughed or
rather tried to laugh at all that had passed and
endeavoured to persuade himself that it was a
mere freak the imagination conjured up by
the stories he had heard but he was a little
puzzled to find the door his room locked on
the inside notwithstanding that he had positively
seen it swing open as the footsteps entered
he returned to town in a state considerable
perplexity but he determined to say nothing on
the subject until his doubts were either confirmed
or removed by another night's watching
his silence was a grievous disappointment to the
gossips who had gathered at the doctor's mansion
they had prepared their minds to hear
direful tales and they were almost in a rage at
being assured that he had nothing to relate
the next night then dolph repeated his
vigil he now entered the house with some
trepidation he was particular in examining
 adolph heyligek
the fastenings all the doors and securing
them well he locked the door his chamber
and placed a chair upon it then having
despatched his supper he threw himself on his
mattress and endeavoured to sleep it was all
in vain a thousand crowding fancies kept him
waking the time slowly dragged on as if
minutes were spinning themselves out into
hours as the night advanced he grew more
and more nervous and he almost started from
his couch when he heard the mysterious footstep
again on the staircase up it came as
before solemnly and slowly tramp tramp
tramp it approached along the passage the
door again swung open as if there had been
neither lock nor impediment and a strange
looking figure stalked into the room it w as
an elderly man large and robust clothed in the
old flemish fashion he had on a kind short
cloak with a garment under it belted round
the waist a pair russet boots very large
at top and standing widely from his legs he
had trunk hose with great bunches at the
bolph heyliger 
knees his hat was broad and slouched with
a feather trailing over one side his irongray
hair hung in thick masses in his neck and he
had a short grizzled beard he walked slowly
round the room as if examining that all was
safe then hanging his hat on a peg beside the
door he sat down in the elbow chair and leaning
his elbow on the table fixed his eyes on
dolph with an unmoving and deadening stare
dolph was not naturally a coward but he
had been brought up in an implicit belief in
ghosts and goblins a thousand stories came
swarming to his mind that he had heard about
this building and as he looked at this strange personage
with his uncouth garb his pale visage
his grizzly beard and his fixed staring fishlike
eye his teeth began to chatter his hair to rise
on his head and a cold sweat to break out allover
his body how long he remained in this
situation he could not tell for he was like one
fascinated he could not take his gaze off
from the spectre but lay staring at him with
his whole intellect absorbed in the contemplated
adolph heyliger
tion the old man remained seated behind the
table without stirring or turning an eye always
keeping a dead stead glare upon dolph
at length the household cock from a neighbouring
farm clapped his wings and gave a loud
cheerful crow that rung over the fields at the
sound the old man slowly rose and took down
his hat from the peg the door opened and
closed after him he was heard to go slowly
down the staircase tramp tramp tramp and
when he had got to the bottom all was again
silent dolph lay and listened earnestly counted
every foot fall listened and listened if the steps
should return until exhausted with watching
and agitation he fell into a troubled sleep
daylight again brought fresh courage and assurance
he would fain have considered all that
had passed as a mere dream yet there stood
the chair in which the unknown had seated himself
 there was the table on which he had leaned
 there was the peg on w r which he had hung his
hat and there was the door locked precisely ashe
himself locked it with the chair placed against
adolph heyliger 
it he hastened down stairs and examined the
doors and windows all were exactly in the same
state in which he had left them and there was
no apparent way by which any being could have
entered and left the house without leaving some
trace behind pooh said dolph to himself
it was all a dream but it would not do the
more he endeavoured to shake the scene off from
his mind the more it haunted him
though he persisted in a strict silence as to
all that he had seen and heard yet his looks betrayed
the uncomfortable night that he had passed
it was evident there was something wonderful
hidden under this mysterious reserve the
doctor took him into the study locked the door
and sought to have a full and confidential communication
 but he could get nothing out him
frau use took him aside into the pantry but to
as little purpose and peter de groodt held him
by the button for a full hour in the churchyard
the very place to get at the bottom a ghost
story but came off not a whit wiser than the
rest it is always the case however that one
 adolph heyligkk
truth concealed makes a dozen current lies it
is like a guinea locked up in a bank that has a
dozen paper representatives before the day
was over the neighbourhood was full reports
some said that dolph heyliger watched in the
haunted house with pistols loaded with silver
bullets others that he had had a long talk with a
spectre without a head others that doctor
knipperhausen and the sexton had been hunted
down the bowerylane and quite into town by
a legion ghosts their old customers some
shook their heads and thought it a shame that
the doctor should put dolph to pass the night
alone in that dismal house where he might be
spirited away no one knew whither while others
observed with a shrug that if the devil did carry
off the youngster it would but be taking his
own
these rumours at length reached the ears 
the good dame heyliger and as may be supposed
threw her into a terrible alarm for her
son to have exposed himself to dangers from living
foes would have been nothing so dreadful
adolph heylfger 
in her eyes as to dare alone the terrors the
haunted house she hastened goethe doctor's
and passed a great part the day in attempting
to dissuade dolph from repeating his vigil she
told him a score tales which her gossiping
friends had just related to her persons who
had been carried off when watching alone in old
ruinous houses it was all to no effect dolph's
pride as well as curiosity was piqued he endeavoured
to calm the apprehensions his mother
and to assure her that there was no truth
in all the rumours she had heard she looked
at him dubiously and shook her head but finding
his determination was not to be shaken she
brought him a little thick dutch bible with brass
clasps to take with him as a sword wherewith
to fight the powers darkness and lest that
might not be sufficient the housekeeper gave him
the heidelberg catechism by way dagger
the next night therefore dolph took up his
quarters for the third time in the old mansion
whether dream or not the same thing was repeated
towards midnight when every thing
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
was still the same sound echoed through the
empty halls tramp tramp tramp the stairs
were again ascended the door again swung
open the old man entered walked round the
room hung up his hat and seated himself by
the table the same fear and trembling came
over poor dolph though not in so violent a degree
he lay in the same way motionless and
fascinated staring at the figure which regarded
him as before with a dead fixed chilling
gaze in this way they remained for a longtime
till by degrees dolph's courage began gradually
to revive whether alive or dead this
being had certainly some object in his visitation
and he recollected to have heard it said that
spirits have no power to speak until they are
spoken to summoning up resolution therefore
and making two or three attempts before he
could get his parched tongue in motion he addressed
the unknown in the most solemn form
 adjuration that he could recollect and demanded
to know what was the motive his
visit
adolph heylifier 
no sooner had he finished than the old man
rose and took down his hat the door opened and
he went out looking back upon dolph just ashe
crossed the threshold as if expecting him to
follow the youngster did not hesitate an instant
he took the candle in his hand and the
bible under his arm and obeyed the tacit invitation
the candle emitted a feeble uncertain
ray but still he could see the figure before him
slowly descending the stairs he followed trembling
when it had reached the bottom the
stairs it turned through the hall towards the back
door the mansion dolph held the light over
balustrades but in his eagerness to catch a sight
 the unknown he flared his feeble taper so
suddenly that it went out still there was
sufficient light from the pale moon beams that
fell through a narrow window to give him an
indistinct view the figure near the door he
followed therefore down stairs and turned
towards the place but when he got there
the unknown had disappeared the door remained
fast barred and bolted there was no
 adolph heyliger
other mode exit yet the being whatever he
might be was gone he unfastened the door
and looked out into the fields it was a hazy
moonlight night so that the eye could distinguish
objects at some distance he thought he
saw the unknown in a footpath that led from
the door he was not mistaken but how had
he got out the house he did not pause to
think but followed on the old man proceeded
at a measured pace without looking about him
his footsteps sounding on the hard ground he
passed through the orchard apple trees that
stood near the house always keeping to the footpath
it led to a well situated in a little hollow
which had supplied the farm with water just
at this well dolph lost sight him he rubbed
his eyes and looked again but nothing was
to be seen the unknown he reached the
well but nobody was there all the surrounding
ground was open and clear there was no
bush nor hiding place he looked down the
well and saw at a great depth the reflection 
the sky in the still water after remaining here
adolph heyliger 
for some time without seeing or hearing anything
more his mysterious conductor hereturned
to the house full awe and wonder
he bolted the door groped his way back to
bed and it was long before he could compose
himself to sleep
his dreams were strange and troubled he
thought he was following the old man along the
side a great river until they came to a vessel
that was on the point sailing and that his
conductor led him on board arid vanished he
remembered the commander the vessel a short
swarthy man with cried black hair blind 
one eye and lame one leg but the rest his
dream was very confused sometimes he wassailing
sometimes on shore now amidst storms
and tempests and now wandering quietly in unknown
streets the figure the unknown was
strangely mingled up with the incidents the
dream and the whole distinctly wound up by
his finding himself on board the vessel again
returning home with a great bag money 
 adolph heyliger
when he woke the gray cool light dawn
was streaking the horizon and the cocks passing
the rcveil from farm to farm throughout the
country he rose more harassed and perplexed
than ever he was singularly confounded by
all that he had seen and dreamt and began to
doubt whether his mind was not affected and
whether all that was passing in his thoughts
might not be mere feverish fantasy in his present
state mind he did not feel disposed to
return immediately to the doctor's and undergo
the crossquestioning the household he
made a scanty breakfast therefore on the remains
 his last night's provisions and then
wandered out into the fields to meditate on all
that had befallen him lost in thought he rambled
about gradually approaching the town until
the morning was far advanced when he was
roused by a hurry and bustle around him he
found himself near the water's edge in a throng
 people hurrying to a pier where there was a
vessel ready to make sail he was unconsciously
carried along by the impulse the crowd and
adolph heyliger 
found that it was a sloop on the point sailing
up the hudson to albany there was much
leavetaking and kissing old women and
children and great activity in carrying on board
baskets bread and cakes and provisions all
kinds notwithstanding the mighty joints 
meat that dangled over the stern for a voyage
to albany was an expedition great moment
in those days the commander the sloop
was hurrying about and giving a world orders
which were not very strictly attended to 
one man being busy in lighting his pipe and another
in sharpening his snickersee
the appearance the commander suddenly
caught dolph's attention he was short and swarthy
with cried black hair blind one eye
and lame one leg the very commander that
he had seen in his dream surprized and aroused
he considered the scene more attentively and
recalled still further traces his dream the
appearance the vessel the river and a
a variety other objects accorded with the imperfect
images vaguely rising to recollection
 adolph heyliger
as he stood musing on these circumstances
the captain suddenly called to him in dutch
step on board young man or you'll be left
behind he was startled by the summons
he saw that the sloop was cast loose and was
actually moving from the pier it seemed as if he
was actuated by some irresistible impulse he
sprung upon the deck and the next moment the
sloop was hurried off by the wind and tide
dolph's thoughts and feelings were all in tumult
and confusion he had been strongly
worked upon by the events that had recently
befallen him and could not but think that there
was some connexion between his present situation
and his last night's dream he felt as if he
was under supernatural influence and he tried
to assure himself with an old and favourite maxim
 his that one way or other all would turnout
for the best for a moment the indignation
 the doctor at his departure without leave
passed across his mind but that was a matter 
little moment then he thought the distress 
his mother at his strange disappearance and the
adolph heyliger 
idea gave him a sudden pang he would have
intreated to he put on shore but he knew with
such wind and tide the entreaty would have been
in vain then the inspiring love novelty and
adventure nine rushing in full tide through his
bosom he felt himself launched strangely and
suddenly on the world and under full way to explore
the regions wonder that lay up this mighty
river and beyond those blue mountains that had
bounded his horizon since childhood while he
was lost in this whirl thought the sails strained
to the freeze the shores seemed to hurry away
behind him and before he perfectly recovered
his selfpossession the sloop was ploughing her
way past spiking devil and yonkers and the
tallest chimney the manhattoes had faded
from his sight
i have said that a voyage up the hudson in
those days was an undertaking some moment
 indeed it was as much thought as a
voyage to europe is at present the sloops
were often many days on the way the cautious
navigators taking in sail when it blew fresh and
vol 
 adolph heyligek
coming to anchor at night and stopping to send
the boat ashore for milk for tea without which
it w r as impossible for the worthy old lady passengers
to subsist and then there were the
much talked perils the tappaan zee and
the highlands in short a prudent dutch burgher
would talk such a voyage for months and
even years before hand and never undertook
it without putting his affairs in order making
his will and having prayers said for him in the
low dutch churches
in the course such a voyage therefore
dolph was satisfied he would have time enough
to reflect and to make up his mind what he
should do when he arrived at albany the captain
with his blind eye and lame leg would it is
true bring his strange dream to mind and perplex
him sadly for a few moments but late his
life had been made up so much dreams arid
realities his nights and days had been so jumbled
together that he seemed to be moving continually
in a delusion there is always however
a kind vagabond consolation in a man's
adolph heyliger 
having nothing in this world to lose with this
dolph comforted his heart and determined
to make the most the present enjoyment
in the second day their voyage they came
to the highlands it was the latter part a
calm sultry day that they floated gently with
the tide between these stern mountains there
was that perfect quiet which prevails over nature
in the languor summer heat the turning
 a plank or the accidental falling an
oar on deck was echoed from the mountain side
and reverberated along the shores and if by
chance the captain gave a shout command
there were airy tongues that mocked it from
every cliff
dolph gazed about him in mute delight and
wonder at these scenes nature's magnificence
to the left the dunderberg heaved its woody
precipices height over height forest over forest
away into the deep summer sky to the right
strutted forth the bold promontory anthony's
nose with a solitary eagle wheeling about it 
while beyond mountain succeeded to mountain
 adolph heyliger
until they seemed to lock their arms together
and confine this mighty river in their embraces
there was a feeling quiet luxury in gazing
at the broad green bosoms here and there scooped
out among the precipices or at woodlands
high in air nodding over the edge some beetling
bluff and all transparent in the yellow
sunshine
in the midst his admiration dolph remarked
a pile bright snowy clouds peering above
the western heights it was succeeded by
another and another each seemingly pushing
onwards its predecessor and towering with dazzling
brilliancy in the deep blue atmosphere
and now muttering peals thunder were faintly
heard rolling behind the mountains the river
hitherto still and glassy reflecting pictures 
the sky and land now showed a dark ripple
at a distance as the breeze came creeping up it
the fish hawks wheeled and screamed and
sought their nests on the high dry trees the
crows flew clamorously to the crevices the
adolph heyliger 
rocks and all nature seemed conscious the approaching
thunder gust
the clouds now rolled in volumes over the
mountain tops their summits still bright and
snowy but the lower parts an inky blackness
the rain began to patter down in broad
and scattered drops the wind freshened and
curled up the waves at length it seemed as if
the bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain
tops and complete torrents rain came
rattling down the lightning leaped from cloud
to cloud and streamed quivering against the
rocks splitting and rending the stoutest forest
trees the thunder burst in tremendous explosions
 the peals were echoed from mountain to
mountain they crashed upon dunderberg and
then rolled up the long defile the highlands
each headland making a new echo until old
bull hill seemed to bellow back the storm
for a time the scudding rack and mist and
the sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from
the sight there was a fearful gloom illumined
still more fearfully by the streams lightning
 adolph heyliger
which glittered among the rain drops never
had dolph beheld such an absolute warring 
the elements it seemed as if the storm was
tearing and rending its way through this mountain
defile and had brought all the artillery 
heaven into action
the vessel was hurried on by the increasing
wind until she came to where the river makes
a sudden bend the only one in the whole course
 its majestic career just as they turned the
point a violent flaw wind came sweeping down
a mountain gully bending the forest before it
and in a moment lashing up the river into white
froth and foam the captain saw the danger
and cried out to lower the sail before the order
could be obeyed the flaw struck the sloop and
threw her on her beam ends every thing now
was fright and confusion the flapping the
sails the whistling and rushing the wind 
the bawling the captain and crew the shrieking
 the passengers all mingled with the rollthis
must have been the bend at west point
adolph heyliger 
ing and bellowing the thunder in the midst
 the uproar the sloop righted at the same
time the mainsail shifted the boom came sweeping
the quarterdeck and dolph who was gazing
unguardedly at the clouds found himself ina
moment floundering in the river
for once in his life one his idle accomplishments
was use to him the many truant
hours which he had devoted to sporting in the
hudson had made him an expert swimmer 
yet with all his strength and skill he found
great difficulty in reaching the shore his disappearance
from the deck had not been noticed
by the crew who were all occupied with their
own danger the sloop was driven along with
inconceivable rapidity she had hard work to
weather a long promontory on the eastern shore
round which the river turned and which completely
shut her from dolph's view
it was on a point the western shore that
he landed and scrambling up the rocks he
threw himself faint and exhausted at the foot
 a tree by degrees the thunder gust passed
 adolph heyliger
over the clouds rolled away to the east
where they lay piled in feathery masses tinted
with the last rosy rays the sun the distant
play the lightning might be still seen about
their dark bases and now and then might be
heard the faint muttering the thunder
dolph rose and sought about to see if any path
led from the shore but all was savage and
trackless the rocks were piled upon each
other great trunks trees lay shattered about
as they had been blown down by the strong
winds which draw through these mountains or
had fallen through age the rocks too were
overhung with wild vines and briars which
completely matted themselves together and opposed
a barrier to all ingress every movement
that he made shook down a shower from the
dripping foliage he attempted to scale one 
these almost perpendicular heights he was
strong and agile but he found it an herculean
undertaking often he was supported merely
by crumbling projections the rock and sometimes
he clung to roots and branches trees
adolph heyliger 
and hung almost suspended in the air the
wood pigeon came cleaving his whistling flight
by him and the eagle screamed from the brow
 the impending cliff as he was thus clambering
he was on the point seizing hold 
a shrub to aid his ascent when something rustled
swiftly among the leaves and he saw a snake
quivering along like lightning almost from under
his hand it coiled itself up immediately
in an attitude defiance with flattened head
distended jaws and quickly vibrating tongue
that played like a little flame about its mouth
dolph's heart turned faint within him and he
had well nigh let go his hold and tumbled
down the precipice the serpent stood on the
defensive but for an instant it was an instinctive
movement defence and finding there
was no attack it glided away into a cleft the
rock dolph's eye followed it with fearful intensity
and he saw at a glance that he was in
the vicinity a nest adders that lay knotted
and writhing and hissing in the chasm
he hastened with all speed to escape from so
vol 
 adolph heyliger
frightful a neighbourhood his imagination
was full this new horror he saw an adder
in every curling vine and heard the tail a rattle
snake in every dry leaf that rustled
at length he succeeded in scrambling to the
summit a precipice but it was covered by a
dense forest wherever he could gain a lookout
between the trees he saw that the coast rose
into heights and cliffs one rising beyond another
until huge mountains overtopped the whole
there were no signs cultivation nor any
smoke curling from among the trees to indicate
a human residence every thing was wild and
solitary as he was standing on the edge a
precipice that overlooked a deep ravine fringed
with trees his feet detached a great fragment 
rock it fell crashing its way through the treetops
down into the chasm a loud whoop or
rather a yell issued from the bottom the glen 
the moment after there was the report a gun
and a ball came whistling over his head cutting
the twigs and leaves and burying itself deep in
the bark a chestnut tree
adolph heyliger 
dolph did not wait for a second shot but made
a precipitate retreat fearing every moment to
hear the enemy in pursuit he succeeded however
in returning unmolested to the shore and
determined to penetrate no farther into a country
so beset with savage perils
he sat himself down dripping disconsolately
on a wet stone what was to be done where
was he to shelter himself the hour repose
was approaching the birds were seeking their
nests the bat began to flit about in the twilight 
and the night hawk soaring high in heaven seemed
to be calling out the stars night gradually
closed in and wrapped every thing in gloom and
though it was the latter part summer yet the
breeze stealing along the river and among these
dripping forests was chilly and penetrating
especially to a halfdrowned man
as he sat drooping and despondent in this comfortless
condition he perceived a light gleaming
through the trees near the shore where the
winding the river made a deep bay it
cheered him with the hopes that here might be
 adolph heyliger
some human habitation where he might get
something to appease the clamorous cravings 
his stomach and what was equally necessary in
his shipwrecked condition a comfortable shelter
for the night it was with extreme difficulty
that he made his way towards the light along
ledges rocks down which he was in danger
 sliding into the river and over great trunks
 fallen trees some which had been blown
down in the late storm and lay so thickly together
that he had to struggle through their
branches at length he came to the brow a
rock that overhung a small dell from whence
the light proceeded it was from a fire at the
foot a great tree that stood in the midst a
grassy interval or plat among the rocks the
fire cast up a red glare among the gray crags and
impending trees leaving chasms deep gloom
that looked like entrances to caverns a small
brook rippled close by betrayed by the quivering
reflection the frame there were two
figures moving about the fire and others squatted
before it as they were between him and
adolph heyliger 
the light they were in complete shadow but one
 them happening to move round to the opposite
side dolph was startled at perceiving by the
full glare falling on painted features and glittering
on silver ornaments that he was an indian
he now looked more narrowly and saw guns
leaning against a tree and a dead body lying on
the ground
dolph now began to doubt whether he was
not in a worse condition than before here was
the very foe that had fired at him from the glen
he endeavoured to retreat quietly not caring to
intrust himself to these half human beings in so
savage and lonely a place it was too late the
indian with that eagle quickness eye so remarkable
in his race perceived something stirring
among the bushes on the rock he seized
one the guns that leaned against the tree a
moment more and dolph might have had his
passion for adventure cured by a bullet he
hallooed loudly in the indian salutation friendship
the whole party sprang upon their feet 
the salutation was returned and the straggler
was invited to join them at the fire
 adolph heyliger
on approaching he found to his consolation
that the party was composed white men as
well as indians one who was evidently the
principal personage or commander was seated
on a trunk a tree before the fire he was a
large stout man somewhat advanced in life
but hale and hearty his face was bronzed almost
to the colour an indian's with strong
but rather jovial features an aquiline nose and
a mouth shaped like a mastiff's his face was
half thrown in shade by a broad hat with a
buck's tail in it his iron gray hair hung short
in his neck he wore a hunting frock with
indian leggings and mockasons and a tomahawk
in the broad wampum belt round his waist
as dolph caught a distinct view his person
and features he was struck with something that
reminded him the old man the haunted
house the man before him however was different
in his dress and age he was more cheery
too in his aspect and it was hard to define where
the vague resemblance lay but a resemblance
there certainly was dolph felt some degree 
adolph heyliger 
awe in approaching him but was assured by
the frank hearty welcome with which he was
received as he cast his eyes about too he
was still farther encouraged by perceiving that
the dead body which had caused him some alarm
was that a deer and his satisfaction was
complete in discovering by the savoury steams
which issued from a kettle suspended by a
hooked stick over the fire that there was a part
cooking for the evening's repast he now found
that he had fallen in with a rambling hunting
party such as often took place in those days
among the settlers along the river the hunter is
always hospitable and nothing makes men more
social and unceremonious than meeting in the
wilderness the commander the party
poured him out a dram cheering liquor which
he gave him with a merry leer to warm his
heart and ordered one his followers to fetch
some garments from a pinnace which was
moored in a cove close by while those in
which our hero was dripping might be dried
before the fire
 adolph heyliger
dolph found as he had suspected that the
shot from the glen which had come so near
giving him his quietus when on the precipice
was from the party before him he had nearly
crushed one them by the fragment rock
which he had detached and the jovial old
hunter in the broad hat and bucktail had fired
at the place where he saw the bushes move
supposing it to be some wild animal he
laughed heartily at the blunder it being what
is considered an exceeding good joke among
hunters but faith my lad said he if i
had but caught a glimpse you to take sight
at you would have followed the rock antony
vander heyden is seldom known to miss his
aim these last words were at once a clue
to dolph's curiosity and a few questions let
him completely into the character the man
before him and his band woodland rangers
the commander in the broad hat and
hunting frock was no less a personage than the
heer antony vander heyden albany 
whom dolph had many a time heard he was
adolph heyliger 
in fact the hero many a story being a man 
singular humours and whimsical habits that
were matters wonder to his quiet dutch neighbours
as he was a man property having
had a father before him from whom he inherited
large tracts wild land and whole barrels full
 wampum he could indulge his humours
without control instead staying quietly at
home eating and drinking at regular meal times
amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the
bench before the door and then turning into a
comfortable bed at night he delighted in all
kinds rough wild expeditions he was
never so happy as when on a hunting party in
the wilderness sleeping under trees or bark
sheds or cruising down the river or on some
woodland lake fishing and fowling and living
the lord knows how
he was a great friend to indians and to an
indian mode life which he considered true
natural liberty and manly enjoyment when at
home he had always several indian hangerson
who loitered about his house sleeping like
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
hounds in the sunshine or preparing hunting and
fishing tackle for some new expedition or shooting
at marks with bows and arrows over these
vagrant beings heer antony had as perfect command
as a huntsman over his pack though they
were great nuisances to the regular people his
neighbourhood as he was a rich man no one
ventured to thwart his humours indeed he had
a hearty joyous manner about him that made him
universally popular he would troll a dutch
song as he tramped along the street hail everyone
half a mile off and when he entered a house
he would slap the good man familiarly on his
back shake him by the hand till he roared and
kiss his wife and daughters before his face in
short there was no pride nor ill humour about
heer antony
beside his indian hangerson he had three
or four humble friends among the white men
who looked up to him as a patron and had the
run his kitchen and the favour being taken
with jim occasionally on his expeditions it
was with a medley such retainers that he was
adolph heyliger 
at present on a cruize along the shores the
hudson in a pinnace which he kept for his own
recreation there were two white men with
him dressed partly in the indian style with
mockasons and hunting shirts the rest his
crew consisted four favourite indians they
had been prowling about the river without any
definite object until they had found themselves
in the highlands where they had passed two or
three days hunting the deer which still lingered
among those mountains
it is a lucky circumstance young man
said antony vander heyden that you happened
to be knocked overboard today as tomorrow
morning we start early on our return
homewards and you might then have looked
in vain for a meal among these mountains
u but come lads stir about stir about let's
see what prog we have for supper the kettle
has boiled long enough my stomach cries cupboard
 and i'll warrant our guest is in no mood
to dally with his trencher
there was a bustle now in the little encamped
adolph heyliger
merit one took off the kettle and turned apart 
the contents into a huge wooden bowl another
prepared a flat rock for a table while a third
brought various utensils from the pinnace which
was moored close by and heer antony himself
brought a flask or two precious liquor from
his own private locker knowing his boon companions
too well to trust any them with the
key a rude but hearty repast was soon spread 
consisting smoking venison and cold bacon
with indian corn and round brown loaves 
good household bread never had dolph made
a more delicious repast and when he had washed
it down by two or three draughts from the
heer antony's flask and felt the jolly liquor sending
its warmth through his veins and glowing
round his heart he would not have changed his
situation no not with the governor the
province
the heer antony too grew chirping and
joyous he told half a dozen fat stories at which
his white followers laughed immoderately
though the indians as usual maintained an invincible
gravity this is your true life my
bolfh heyliger 
boy would he say slapping dolph on the
shoulder a man is never a man till he can
defy wind and weather range in the woods
sleep under a tree and live on bass wood leaves 
and then he would sit with his hat on one side
swaying a short squab dutch bottle in his hand
and sing a stave or two a dutch drinking
song to which his myrmidons would join in
chorus
with all his joviality however he mingled
discretion though he pushed the bottle unreservedly
to dolph yet he always took care to
help his followers himself and was particular in
only granting a certain allowance to the indians
heer antony knew the kind beings he had to
deal with
the repast was now at an the indians
had made their supper in silence from the contents
 the kettle and having drank their allowance
and smoked their pipes they wrapped
themselves in their blankets stretched themselves
on the ground with their feet to the fire and
soon fell asleep the others remained chatting
 adolph heyliger
before the fire which the gloom the forest and
the dampness the air from the late storm rendered
extremely comfortable and cheering
the conversation gradually moderated from
the hilarity supper time and turned upon
hunting adventures and exploits and perils in the
wilderness many which were so strange and
improbable that i will not venture to repeat
them lest the veracity heer antony and his
comrades be brought into question there were
many legendary tales told also about the river
and the settlements on its borders and as heer
antony sat in a twisted root a fallen tree that
served him for a kind arm chair and told these
wild stories with the fire gleaming on his strongly
marked face dolph was again repeatedly
struck with something in his looks that reminded
him the nightly visiter to the haunted house
the circumstance dolph's falling overboard
led to the relation anecdotes mishaps that
had befallen voyagers on this great river many
 which were attributed to supernatural causes
on dolph's staring at this suggestion antony
adolph heyliger 
vander heyden assured him that it was very
currently believed among the settlers along the
river that these highlands were under the dominion
 supernatural and mischievous beings 
which seemed particularly to vent their spleen
upon the dutch skippers some he said believed
them to be the evil spirits conjured up by
the indian wizards in the early times the
province to revenge themselves on the strangers
who had dispossessed them their country the
greater part however accounted for them by
the legend the storm ship which haunted
pointnopoint finding dolph to be utterly
ignorant this tradition heer antony undertook
to tell it in the very words in which it had
been written out by mynheer selon an early
poet the newnetherlands giving therefore
a stir to the fire he adjusted himself comfortably
in his root a tree and throwing back his
head and closing his eyes for a few moments to
summon up his recollection he related the follow t 
ing legend
 adolph heyliger
the storm ship
in the golden age the province the
new netherlands when it was under the sway
 outer van tiller otherwise called walter
the doubter the people the manhattoes
were alarmed one sultry afternoon just about
the time the summer solstice by a tremendous
storm thunder and lightning the rain descended
in such torrents as absolutely to spatter
up and smoke along the ground it seemed as
if the thunder rattled and rolled over the very
roofs the houses the lightning was seen
to play about the church st nicholas and
to strive three times in vain to strike its weather
cock garret van home's new chimney
was split almost from top to bottom and doffue
mildeberger was struck speechless from his baldfaced
mare just as as he was riding into town
in a word it was one those unparalleled
storms that only happen once within the meadolph
heyliger 
more that venerable personage known in all
towns by the appellation the oldest inhabitant

great was the terror the good old women
 the manhattoes they gathered their children
together and took refuge in the cellars after
having hung a shoe on the iron point every
bed post lest they should attract the lightning
at length the storm abated the thunder sunk
into a growl and the setting sun breaking from
under the fringed borders the clouds made
the broad bosom the bay to gleam like a sea
 molten gold
the word was given from the fort that a ship
was standing up the bay it passed from mouth
to mouth and street to street and soon put the
little capital in a bustle the arrival a ship
in those early times the settlement was an
event vast importance to the inhabitants it
brought them news from the old world from the
land their birth from which they were so completely
severed to the yearly ship too they
looked for their supply luxuries finery 
vol 
adolph heyliger
comforts and almost necessaries the good
vrouw could not have her new cap nor new
gown until the arrival the ship the artist
waited for it for his tools the burgomaster for
his pipe and his supply hollands the schoolboy
for his top and marbles and the lordly
landholder for the bricks with which he was to
build his new mansion thus every one rich
and poor great and small looked out for the arrival
 the ship it was the great yearly
event the town new amsterdam and
from one the year to the other the ship
the ship the ship was the continual topic
 conversation
the news from the fort therefore brought all
the populace down to the battery to behold the
wishedfor sight it was not exactly the time
when she had been expected to arrive and the
circumstance was a matter some speculation
many were the groups collected about the battery
here and there might be seen a burgomaster 
slow and pompous gravity giving his opinion
with great confidence to a crowd old women
adolph heyllger 
and idle boys at another place was a knot 
old weather beaten fellows who had been seamen
or fishermen in their times and were great
authorities on such occasions these gave different
opinions and caused great disputes among
their several adherents but the man most
looked up to and followed and watched by the
crowd was hans van pelt an old dutch sea captain
retired from service the nautical oracle 
the place he reconnoitred the ship through
an ancient telescope covered with tarry canvas
hummed a dutch tune to himself and said no
things hum however from hans van pek
had always more weight with the public thana
speech from another man
in the mean time the ship became more distinct
to the naked eye she was a stout round
dutch built vessel with high bow and poop and
bearing dutch colours the evening sun gilded
her bellying canvas as she came riding over
the long waving billows the sentinel who had
given notice her approach declared that he
first got sight her when she was in the centre
 adolph heyliger
 the bay and that she broke suddenly upon
his sight just as if she had come out the bosom
 the black thunder cloud the bystanders
looked at hans van pelt to see what he
would say to this report hans van pelt screwed
his mouth closer together and said nothing 
upon which some shook their heads and others
shrugged their shoulders
the ship was now repeatedly hailed but made
no reply and passing by the fort stood on up the
hudson a gun was brought to bear on her
and with some difficulty loaded and fired by
hans van pelt the garrison not being expert in
artillery the shot seemed absolutely to pass
through the ship and to skip along the water
on the other side but no notice was taken it
what was strange she had all her sails set and
sailed right against wind and tide which were
both down the river
upon this hans van pelt who was likewise
harbour master ordered his boat and set off to
board her but after rowing for two or three hours
he returned without success sometimes he
adolph heyliger 
would get within one or two hundred yards 
her and then in a twinkling she would be half
a mile off some said it w r as because his oarsmen
who were rather pursy and short winded
stopped every now and then to take breath and
spit on their hands but this it is probable was a
mere scandal h e got near enough however to
see the crew who were all dressed in the dutch
style the officers in doublets and high hats and
feathers not a word was spoken by any one
on board they stood as motionless as so many
statues and the ship seemed as ifleft to her own
government thus she kept on away up the
river lessening and lessening in the evening sunshine
until she faded from sight like a little
white cloud melting away in a summer sky
the appearance this ship threw the governor
into one the deepest doubts that ever beset
him in the whole course his administration
fears were entertained for the security the
infant settlements on the river lest this might
be an enemy's ship in disguise sent to take
possession the governor called together his
counsel repeatedly to assist him with their conadolph
heyliger
lectures he sat in his chair state built 
timber from the sacred forest the hague and
smoked his long jasmin pipe and listened to
all that his counsellors had to say on a subject
about which they knew nothing but in spite 
all the conjecturing the sagest and oldest heads
the governor still continued to doubt
messengers were despatched to different places
on the river but they returned without any
tidings the ship had made no port day after
dny and week after week elapsed but she never
returned down the hudson as however the
council seemed solicitous for intelligence they
soon had it in abundance the captains the
sloops seldom arrived without bringing some report
 having seen the strange ship at different
parts the river sometimes near the pallisadoes
 sometimes off croton point and sometimes
in the highlands but she was never reported
as having been seen above the highlands
the crews the sloops it is true generally differed
among themselves in their accounts 
these apparitions but that may have arisen
adolph heyliger 
from the uncertain situations in which they saw
her sometimes it was by the flashes a thunder
storm lighting up a pitchy night and giving
glimpses her careering across tappaan zee or
the wide waste haverstraw bay at one
moment she would appear close upon them as if
likely to run them down and would throw
them into great bustle and alarm when the next
flash would show her far off always sailing
against the wind sometimes in quiet moonlight
nights she would be seen under some high
bluff the highlands all in deep shadow excepting
her topsails glittering in the moonbeams
by the time however that the voyagers
would reach the place there would be no ship
to be seen and when they had passed on for
some distance and looked back behold there
she was again with her topsails in the moonshine
 her appearance was always just after
or just before or just in the midst unruly
weather and she was known by all the skippers
and voyagers the hudson by the name the
storm ship
 adolph heyligeu
these reports perplexed the governor and his
council more than ever and it would be endless
to repeat the conjectures and opinions that
were uttered on the subject some quoted
cases in point ships seen off the coast 
newengland navigated by witches and goblins
old hans van pelt who had been more
than once to the dutch colony at the cape 
good hope insisted that this must be the flying
dutchman which had so long haunted table
bay but being unable to make port had
now sought another harbour others suggested
that if it really was a supernatural apparition
as there was every natural reason to believe
it might be hendrick hudson and his crew 
the half moon who it was well known had
once run aground in the upper part the river
in seeking a northwest passage to china this
opinion had very little weight with the governor 
but it passed current out doors indeed it
had already been reported that hendrick hudson
and his crew haunted the kaatskill mountain
 and it appeared very reasonable to 
heyliger 
pose that his ship might infest the river where
the enterprise was baffled or that it might bear
the shadowy crew to their periodical revels in
the mountain
other events occurred to occupy the thoughts
and doubts the sage outer and his council 
and the storm ship ceased to be a subject 
deliberation at the board it continued however
to be a matter popular belief and marvellous
anecdote throughout the whole time 
the dutch goverment and particularly just before
the capture newamsterdam and the
subjugation the province by the english
squadron about that time the storm ship
was repeatedly seen in the tappaan zee about
weehawk and even down as far as hoboken
and her appearance was supposed to be ominous
 the approaching squall in public affairs
and the downfall dutch domination
since that time we have no authentic accounts
 her though it is said she still haunts
the highlands and cruises about pointnopoint
people who live along the river insist that they
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
sometimes see her in summer moonlight and
that in a deep still midnight they have heard
the chant her crew as if heaving the lead 
but sights and sounds are so deceptive along
the mountainous shores and about the wide
bays and long reaches this great river that
i confess i have very strong doubts upon the
subject
it is certain nevertheless that strange things
have been seen in these highlands in storms
which are considered as connected with the old
story the ship the captains the river
craft talk a little bulbousbottomed dutch
goblin in trunk hose and su garloaf d hat with
a speaking trumpet in his hand which they say
keeps about the dunderberg mountain they
declare that they have heard him in stormy
weather in the midst the turmoil giving orders
in low dutch for the piping up a fresh gust 
wind or the rattling off another thunder clap
that sometimes he has been seen surrounded by
a crew little imps in broad breeches and short
doublets tumbling head over heels in the rack
adolph meyliger
and mist and playing a thousand gambols in
the air or buzzing like a swarm flies about
antony's nose and that at such time the
hurryscurry the storm was always greatest
one time a sloop in passing by dunderberg
was overtaken by a thunderous that came
scouring down from the mountain and seemed
to burst just over the vessel though tight and
well ballasted yet she laboured dreadfully and
rocked until the water came over the gunwale
all the crew were amazed when it was discovered
that there was a little white sugarloaf hat on
the mast head w which was known at once for
the hat the heer the dunderberg nobody
however dared to climb to the mast head
and get rid this terrible hat the sloop continued
labouring and rocking as if she would
have rolled her mast overboard she seemed
in continual danger either upsetting or running
on shore in this way she drove quite
through the highlands until she had passed
pollopeps island where it is said the jurisdiction
 the dunderberg potentate ceases no
 adolph heyliger
sooner had she passed this bourne than the little
hat all at once spun up into the air like a top 
whirled up all the clouds into a vortex and
hurried them back to the summit the under
 while the sloop righted herself and sailed
on as quietly as if in a millpond nothing
saved her from utter wreck but the fortunate
circumstance having a horse shoe nailed
against the mast a wise precaution against evil
spirits which has since been adopted by all the
dutch captains that navigate this haunted river
there is another story told this foul weather
urchin by skipper daniel ouslesticker 
fishkill who was never known to tell a lie
he declared that in a severe squall he saw him
seated astride his bowsprit riding the sloop
ashore full butt against antony's nose
and that he was exorcised by dominie van
gibson esopus who happened to be onboard
and who sung the hymn st nicholas 
whereupon the goblin threw himself up in the
air like a ball and went off in a whirlwind
carrying away with him the nightcap the
adolph heyliger 
dominie's wife which was discovered the next

sunday morning hanging on the weathercock
 esopus church steeple at least forty miles
off after several events this kind had taken
place the regular skippers the river for a
long time did not venture to pass the under
without lowering their peak out homage
to the heer the mountain and it was
observed that all such as paid this tribute respect
were suffered to pass unmolested
such said antony vander heyden area
few the stories written down by selon the
poet concerning this storm ship which he affirms
to have brought this colony mischievous
imps into the province from some old ghostrid
den country europe i could give you a
host more if necessary for all the accidents
that so often befall the river craft in the highlands
are said to be tricks played off by these
 adolph heyliger
imps the dunderberg but i see that you are
nodding so let us turn in for the night
the moon had now just raised her silver
horns above the round back old bull hill 
and lit up the gray rocks and shagged forests 
and glittered on the waving bosom the river
the night dew was falling and the late gloomy
mountains began to soften and put on a gray
aerial tint in the dewy light the hunters stirred
the fire and threw on fresh fuel to qualify
the damp the night air they then prepared
a bed branches and dry leaves under a
ledge rocks for dolph while antony wander
heyden wrapping himself up in a huge coat
made skins stretched himself before the fire
it was some time however before dolph
could close his eyes he lay contemplating the
strange scene before him the wild w r gods and
rocks around the fire throwing fitful gleams on
the faces the sleeping savages and the heer
antony too who so singularly yet vaguely reminded
him the nightly visitant to the haunted
house now and then he heard the cry 
adolph heyliger 
some animal from the forest or the hooting 
the owl or the notes the whippoorwill which
seemed to abound among these solitudes or the
splash a sturgeon leaping out the river
and falling back full length on its placid surface
he contrasted all this with his accustomed nest
in the garret room the doctor's mansion 
where the only sounds he heard at night were
the church clock telling the hour the drowsy
voice the watchman drawling out that all was
well the deep snoring the doctor's clubbed
nose from below stairs or the cautious labours
 some carpenter rat gnawing in the wainscot
his thoughts then wandered to his poor old
mother what would she think his mysterious
disappearance what anxiety and distress
would she not suffer this was the thought that
would continually intrude itself to mar his present
enjoyment it brought with it a feeling 
pain and compunction and he fell asleep with
the tears yet standing in his eyes
were this a mere tale fancy here would
be a fine opportunity for weaving in strange 
adolph heyliger
ventures among these wild mountains and roving
hunters and after involving my hero ina
variety perils and unheardof difficulties
rescuing him from them all by some miraculous
contrivance but as this is absolutely a true
story i must content myself with simple facts
and keep to probabilities
at an early hour the next day therefore after
a hearty morning's meal the encampment
broke up and our adventurers embarked in the
pinnace antony vander heyden there being
no wind for the sails the indians rowed her
gently along keeping time to a kind chant
 one the white men the day was serene
and beautiful the river without a wave and
as the vessel cleft the glassy water it left a long
undulating track behind the crows who had
scented the hunters banquet were already
gathering and hovering in the air just where a
column thin blue smoke rising from among
the trees showed the place their last night's
quarters as they coasted along the bases 
the mountains the heer antony pointed out to
adolph heyliger 
dolph a bald eagle the sovereign these regions
who sat perched on a dry tree that projected
over the river and with eye turned upwards
seemed to be drinking in the splendour
 the morning sun their approach disturbed
the monarch's meditations he first spread one
wing and then the other balanced himself fora
moment and then quitting his perch with
dignified composure wheeled slowly over their
heads dolph snatched up a gun and sent a
whistling ball after him that cut some the
feathers from his wing the report the gun
leaped sharply from rock to rock and awakened
a thousand echoes but the monarch the
air sailed calmly on ascending higher and higher
and wheeling widely as he ascended soaring
up the green bosom the woody mountain
until he disappeared over the brow a beetling
precipice dolph felt in a manner rebuked by
this proud tranquillity and almost reproached
himself for having so wantonly insulted this
majestic bird heer antony told him laughing
to remember that he was not yet out the tervol
n 
 adolph heyligelt
histories the lord the dunderberg and an old
indian shook his head and observed that there
was bad luck in killing an eagle the hunter on
the contrary should always leave horn a portion
 his spoils
nothing however occurred to molest them
on their voyage they passed pleasantly through
these magnificent and lonely scenes until they
came to where pollopel's island lies like a floating
bower at the extremity the highlands
here they landed until the heat the day should
abate or a breeze spring up that might supersede
the labour the oar some prepared the midday
meal while others reposed under the shade
 the trees in luxurious summer indolence 
looking drowsily forth upon the beauty the
scene on the one side were the highlands
vast and cragged feathered to the top with forests
and throwing their shadows on the glassy
water that dimpled at their feet on the other
side was a wide expanse the river like a
broad lake with long sunny reaches and green
headlands and the distant line shawungunk
adolph heyliger 
mountains waving along a clear horizon or chequered
by a fleecy cloud
but i forbear to dwell on the particulars 
their cruize along the river this vagrant amphibious
life careering across silver sheets 
water coasting wild woodland shores banquetting
on shady promontories with the spreading
tree overhead the river curling its light foam
to one's feet and distant mountain and rock and
tree and snowy cloud and deep blue sky all
mingling in summer beauty before one all this
though never cloying in the enjoyment would
be but tedious in narration
when encamped by the water side some 
the party would go into the woods and hunt 
others would fish sometimes they would amuse
themselves by shooting at a mark by leaping by
running by wrestling and dolph gained great
favour in the eyes antony vander hey den
by his skill and adroitness in all these exercises
which the heer considered as the highest 
manly accomplishments
 adolph heyligek
thus did they coast jollily on choosing only
the pleasant hours for voyaging sometimes in
the cool morning dawn sometimes in the sober
evening twilight and sometimes when the
moonshine spangled the crisp curling waves
that whispered along the sides their little bark
never had dolph felt so completely in his element
 never had he met with any thing so completely
to his taste as this wild haphazard life
he was the very man to second antony vander
heyden in his rambling humours and gained
continually on his affections the heart the
old bushwhacker yearned towards the young
man who seemed thus growing up in his own
likeness and as they approached the their
voyage he could not help inquiring a little into
his history dolph frankly told him his course
 life his severe medical studies his little proficiency
and his very dubious prospects the
heer vas shocked to find that such amazing
talents and accomplishments were to be cramped
and buried under a doctor's wig he had a sovereign
contempt for the healing art having never
adolph heyliger 
had any other physician than the butcher he
bore a mortal grudge to all kinds study also
ever since he had been flogged about an unintelligible
 when he was a boy but to think
that a young fellow like dolph such wonderful
abilities who could shoot fish run jump
ride and wrestle should be obliged to roll pills
and administer juleps for a living twas monstrous
 he told dolph never to despair but to
throw physic to the dogs for a young fellow
 his prodigious talents could never fail to make
his way as you seem to have no acquaintance
in albany said heer antony you shall go
home with me and remain under my roof until
you can look about you and in the mean time y
we can take an occasional bout at shooting and
fishing for it is a pity such talents should be
idle
dolph who was at the mercy chance was
not hard to be persuaded indeed on turning
over matters in his mind which he did very sagely
and deliberately he could not but think that antony
vander heyden was somehow or other 
 adolph heyligek
connected with the story the haunted house 
that the misadventure in the highlands which
had thrown them so strangely together was
somehow or other to work out something
good in short there is nothing so convenient as
this somehow or other way accommodating
one's self to circumstances it is the mainstay
 a heedless actor and tardy reasoner like
dolph heyliger and he who can in this loose
easy way link foregone evil to anticipated good
possesses a secret happiness almost equal to
the philosopher's stone
on their arrival at albany the sight dolph's
companion seemed to cause universal satisfaction
many were the greetings at the river side
and the salutations in the streets the dogs
bounded before him the boys whooped as he
passed every body seemed to know antony
vander heyden dolph followed on in silence
admiring the neatness this worthy burgh for
in those days albany was in all its glory inhabited
almost exclusively by the descendants 
the original dutch settlers it had not as yet
adolph heyliger 
been discovered and colonized by the restless
people newengland every thing was quiet
and orderly every thing was conducted calmly
and leisurely no hurry no bustle no struggling
and scrambling for existence the grass
grew about the unpaved streets and relieved the
eye by its refreshing verdure tall sycamores
or pendent willows shaded the houses with caterpillars
swinging in long silken strings from
their branches or moths fluttering about like
coxcombs in joy at their gay transformation
the houses were built in the old dutch style
with the gable ends towards the street the
thrifty housewife was seated on a bench before
her door in a close crimped cap bright flowered
gown and white apron busily employed in knitting
the husband smoked his pipe on the opposite
bench and the little pet negro girl seated
on the step at her mistress feet was industriously
plying her needle the swallows sported
about the eaves or skimmed along the streets
and brought back some rich booty for their clamorous
young and the little housekeeping wren
 adolph heyliger
flew in and out a lilliputian house or an old
hat nailed against the wall the cows were
coming home lowing through the streets to be
milked at their owners doors and if perchance
there were any loiterers some negro urchin with
a long goad was gently urging them homewards
as dolph's companion passed on he received
a tranquil nod from the burghers and a friendly
word from their wives all calling him familiarly
by the name anton j for it was the custom
in this strong hold the patriarchs where they
had all grown up together from childhood to
call every one by the christian name the
heer did not pause to have his usual jokes with
them for he was impatient to reach his home
at length they arrived at his mansion it was
 some magnitude in the dutch style with
large iron figures on the gables that gave the
date its erection and showed that it had been
built in the earliest times the settlement
the news heer antony's arrival had preceded
him and the whole household was on
the look out a crew negroes large and
dolfh heyliger 
small had collected in front the house to receive
him the old whiteheaded ones who
had grown gray in his service grinned for joy
and made many awkward bows and grimaces 
and the little ones capered about his knees but
the most happy being in the household was a
little plump blooming lass his only child and
the darling his heart she came bounding
out the house but the sight a strange
young man with her father called up for a moment
all the bashfulness a homebred damsel
dolph gazed at her with wonder and delight
never had he seen as he thought any thing so
comely in the shape woman she was dressed
in the good old dutch taste with long stays
and full short petticoats so admirably adapted to
show and set off the female form her hair
turned up under a small round cap displayed
the fairness her forehead she had fine blue
laughing eyes a trim slender waist and soft
swell but in a word she was a little dutch
divinity and dolph who never stopped half
vol 
 adolph heyliger
way in a new impulse fell desperately in love
with her
dolph was now ushered into the house with
a hearty welcome in the interior was a mingled
display heer antony's taste and habits and
the opulence his predecessors the chambers
were furnished with good old carved mahogany
the beaufets and cupboards glittered with embossed
silver and painted china over the parlour
fireplace was as usual the family coat 
arms painted and framed above which was a
long duck fowling piece flanked by an indian
pouch and a powderhorn the room was decorated
with many indian articles such as pipes
 peace tomahawks scalping knives hunting
pouches and belts wampum and there were
various kinds fishing tackle and two or three
fowling pieces in the corners the household
affairs seemed to be conducted in some measure
after the master's humours corrected perhaps
by a little quiet management the daughter's
there was a great degree patriarchal simplicity
and good humoured indulgence the neadolph
heyliger 
goes came into the room without being called
merely to look at their master and hear his
adventures they would stand listening at the
door until he had finished a story and then go
off on a broad grin to repeat it in the kitchen
a couple pet negro children were playing
about the floor with the dogs and sharing with
them their bread and butter all the domestics
looked hearty and happy and when the table
was set for the evening repast the variety and
abundance good household luxuries bore testimony
to the open handed liberality the heer
and the notable housewifery his daughter
in the evening there dropped in several the
worthies the place the van rensselaer
and the gansevoorts and the rosebooms and
others antony vander heyden's intimates
to hear an account his expedition for he was
the sindbad albany and his exploits and adventures
were favourite topics conversation
among the inhabitants while these sat gossiping
together about the door the hall and
telling long twilight stories dolph was cosily
 adolph heyliger
seated entertaining the daughter on a window
bench he had already got on intimate terms
for those were not times false reserve and
idle ceremony and besides there is something
wonderfully propitious to a lover's suit in th
delightful dusk a long summer evening it
gives courage to the most timid tongue and
hides the blushes the bashful the stars
alone twinkled brightly and now and then a
firefly streamed his transient light before the
window or wandering into the room flew
gleaming about the ceiling
what dolph whispered in her ear that long
summer evening it is impossible to say his
words were so low and indistinct that they have
never reached the ear the historian it is
probable however that they were to the purpose
for he had a natural talent at pleasing the
sex and was never long in company with a petticoat
without paying proper court to it in
the mean time the visitors one by one departed
antony vander heyden who had fairly talked
himself silent sat nodding alone in his chair by
adolph heyliger 
the door when he was suddenly aroused by the
hearty salute with which dolph heyliger had
unguardedly rounded off one his periods and
which echoed through the still chamber like the
report a pistol the heer started up rubbed
his eyes called for lights and observed that it
was high time to go to bed on parting for the
night he squeezed dolph heartily by the hand 
looked waggishly in his face shook his head
knowingly ah dolph dolph said he
chuckling i see you're a sly dogjust like i
was at your age 
the chamber in which our hero was lodged
was spacious and panelled with oak it was
furnished with clothes presses and mighty chests
 drawers well waxed and glittering with brass
ornaments these contained ample stock 
family linen for the dutch housewives had always
a laudable pride in showing off their household
treasures to strangers
dolph's mind however was too full to take
particular note the objects around him yet
he could not help continually comparing the free
 adolph heyligek
openhearted cheeriness this establishment
with the starveling sordid joyless housekeeping
at doctor knypperhausen's still there was
something that marred the enjoyment the idea
that he must take leave his hearty host and
pretty hostess and cast himself once more adrift
upon the world to linger here would be folly
he should only get deeper in love and for a
poor varlet like himself to aspire to the daughter
 the great heer vander heyden it was
madness to think such a thing the very
kindness that the girl had shown towards him
prompted him on reflection to hasten his departure
 it would be a poor return for the frank
hospitality his host to entangle his daughter's
heart in an injudicious attachment in a word
dolph was like many other young reasoners 
exceeding good hearts and giddy heads who
think after they act and act differently from what
they think who make excellent determinations
over night and forget to keep them the next
morning
adolph heyliger 
this is a fine conclusion truly my voyage
said he as he almost buried himself in a
sumptuous feather bed and drew the fresh white
sheets up to his chin here am i instead 
finding a bag money to carry home launched
in a strange place with scarcely a stiver in my
pocket and what is worse have jumped ashore
up to my very ears in love into the bargain
however added he after some pause stretching
himself and turning in bed i'm in good
quarters for the present at least so i'll e'en
enjoy the present moment and let the next take
care itself i dare say all will work out
some how or other for the best
as he said these words he reached out his hand
to extinguish the candle when he was suddenly
struck with astonishment and dismay for he
thought he beheld the spectre the haunted
house staring at him from a dusky part the
chamber a second look reassured him as he
perceived that what he had taken for the spectre
was in fact nothing but a flemish portrait that
hung in a shadowy corner just behind a clothes
 adolph heyliger
press it was however the precise representation
 his nightly visiter the same cloak and
belted jerkin the same grizzled beard and fixed
eye the same broad slouched hat with a feather
hanging over one side dolph now called to
mind the resemblance he had frequently remarked
between his host and the old man the haunted
house and was fully convinced that they were
in some way connected and that some especial
destiny had governed his voyage he lay gazing
on the portrait with almost as much awe as he
had gazed on the ghostly original until the
shrill house clock warned him the lateness 
the hour he put out the light but remained
for a long time turning over these curious circumstances
and coincidences in his mind until
he fell asleep his dreams partook the nature
 his waking thoughts he fancied that he
still lay gazing on the picture until by degrees
it became animated that the figure descended
from the wall and walked out the room
that he followed it and found himself by the
well to which the old man pointed smiled on
him and disappeared
rolph heyliger 
in the morning when dolph waked he found
his host standing by his bed side who gave him
a hearty morning's salutation and asked him how
he had slept dolph answered cheerily and took
the occasion to inquire about the portrait that
hung against the wall ah said heer antony
 that's a portrait old killian vanderspie
gel once a burgomaster amsterdam who on
some popular troubles abandoned holland and
came over to the province during the government
 peter stuyvesant he was my ancestor
by the mother's side and an old miserly curmudgeon
he was when the english took
possession new amsterdam in he retired
into the country he fell into a melancholy
apprehending that his wealth would betaken
from him and that he would come to
beggary he turned all his property into cash
and used to hide it away he was for a year
or two concealed in various places fancying
himself sought after by the english to strip him
 his wealth and finally was found dead in
his bed one morning without any one being
vol h 
 adolph heylgek
able to discover where he had concealed the
greater part his money
when his host had left the room dolph remained
for some time lost in thought his
whole mind was occupied by what he had
heard vanderspiegel was his mother's family
name and he recollected to have heard her
speak this very killian vanderspiegel as one
 her ancestors he had heard her say too
that her father was killian's rightful heir only
that the old man died without leaving any thing
to be inherited it now appeared that heer
antony was likewise a descendant and perhaps
an heir also this poor old rich man 
and that thus the heyligers and the vander
hey dens were remotely connected what
thought he if after all this is the interpretation
 my dream j that this is the way i am to
make my fortune by this voyage to albany
and that i am to find the old man's hidden
wealth in the bottom that well but
what an odd roundabout mode communicating
the matter why the vengeance could not
adolph heyliger 
the old goblin have told me about the well at
once without sending me all the way to albany
to hear a story that was to send me all
the way back again 
these thoughts passed through his mind ashe
was dressing he descended the stairs full
 perplexity when the bright face marie
vander heyden suddenly beamed in smiles
upon him and seemed to give him a clue to the
whole mystery after all thought he the
old goblin is in the right if am to get his
wealth he means that i shall marry his pretty
descendant thus both branches the family
will be again united and the property go on in
the proper channel
no sooner did this idea enter his head than it
carried conviction with it he was now all impatience
to hurry back and secure the treasure 
which he did not doubt lay at the bottom 
the well and which he feared every moment
might be discovered by some other person
who knows thought he but this nightwalking
old fellow the haunted house may
 adolph heyliger
be in the habit haunting every visiter and may
give a hint to some shrewder fellow than myself
who will take a shorter cut to the well than by
the way albany he wished a thousand
times that the babbling old ghost was laid in the
red sea and his rambling portrait with him
he was in a perfect fever to depart two or
three days elapsed before any opportunity presented
for returning down the river they were
ages to dolph notwithstanding that he was
basking in the smiles the pretty marie and
daily getting more and more enamoured at
length the very sloop from which he had been
knocked overboard prepared to make sail dolph
made an awkward apology to his host for his
sudden departure antony vaiider heyden was
sorely astonished he had concerted half a
dozen excursions into the wilderness and his
indians were actually preparing for a grand expedition
to one the lakes he took dolph
aside and exerted his eloquence to get him to
give up all thoughts business and to remain
with him but in vain and he at length gave
adolph heyliger 
up the attempt observing that it was a thousand
pities so fine a young man should throw
himself away heer antony however gave
him a hearty shake by the hand at parting with
a favourite fowling piece and an invitation to
come to his house whenever he revisited albany
the pretty little marie said nothing but as he
gave her a farewell kiss her dimpled cheek
turned pale and a tear stood in her eye
dolph sprang lightly on board the vessel
they hoisted sail the wind was fair they
soon lost sight albany and its green hills
and embowered islands they were wafted
gaily past the kaatskill mountains whose fairy
heights were bright and cloudless they passed
prosperously through the highlands without
any molestation from the dunderberg goblin and
his crew they swept on across haverstraw
bay and by croton point and through the
tappaan zee and under the pallisadoes until
on the afternoon the third day they saw the
promontory hoboken hanging like a cloud in
 adolph heyliger
the air and shortly after the roofs the manbattles
rising out the water
dolph's first care was to repair to his mother's
house for he was continually goaded by the
idea the uneasiness she must experience on
his account on his way thither he endeavoured
to arrange some mode accounting for his
absence but felt sadly at a loss for with all his
heedlessness he was naturally frank and sincere
and had never deceived her he had conned
over something that he thought would do when
on entering the street in which her house was
situated he was thunderstruck on beholding ita
heap ruins there had been a great fire
which had destroyed several large houses and
the humble dwelling poor dame heyliger had
been involved in the conflagration the walls
were not so completely destroyed but that dolph
could perceive some traces the scene humble
quiet the scene his childhood the fireplace
with a few the tiles yet remained
though shattered to pieces the wreck the
good old dame's elbow chair and her dutch
adolph heyliger 
family bible reduced almost to a cinder lay
among the rubbish for a moment dolph's
head reeled he was stunned as with a blow 
but the next was a moment excruciating
agony for the idea rushed to his mind that she
had perished in the flames he was relieved
from the worst his fears by one the neighbours
who informed him that his mother was
yet alive but that overcome with fright and
affliction she lay ill at the house old peter
che groodt where she had taken refuge
dolph hastened thither with the penitent
feeling the prodigal son he recalled all
her tenderness her unwearied attention to his
comfort her indulgence his errors her
fond blindness to his faults and then he reflected
on his own idleness and want consideration
 only let her live said dolph
mentally and clasping his hands and i'll
show myself indeed a son 
he found old peter de groodt coming out
 the house peter started back on seeing
him and was for a moment doubtful whether
 adolph heyliger
it was not a ghost that stood before him then
shaking his head he pointed to the door ah
young man young man you're in a hopeful
way truly go in go in and see your poor
mother more sick on your account than her
own
it required some preparation however before
dolph's return could be made known to his
mother and even then the news almost overcame
her when he was admitted to see her
he sunk down beside her bed the poor woman
threw her arms round his neck my boy
my boy art thou still alive for a time she
seemed to have forgotten all her losses and
troubles in her joy at his return at length
recollecting herself ah my poor dolph 
said she thy mother can help thee no longer 
she can no longer help herself what will
become thee my poor son 
mother said dolph don't talk in that
way i've been too long a charge upon you
it's now my part to take care you in your old
days but come be good heart i'm here
adolph heyliger 
again sound and hearty something will yet
turn up things will all olph heyliger
was filled with broad golden pieces a coinage
which he had never seen before it was evident
he had lit on the place where old killian
vanderspiegel had concealed his treasure
fearful being seen by some straggler he
cautiously retired and buried his pot money
in a secret place he now spread terrible stones
about the haunted house and deterred
every one from approaching it while he made
frequent visits to it in stormy days when no one
was stirring in the neighbouring fields though
to tell the truth he did not care to venture therein
the dark for once in his life he was diligent
and industrious and followed up his new
trade angling with such perseverance and
success that in a little while he had hooked up
wealth enough to make him in those moderate
days a rich burgher for life
it would be tedious to detail minutely the
rest his story to tell how he gradually
managed to bring his property into use without
exciting surprise and inquiry how he satisfied
all scruples with regard to retaining the proadolph
heyliger 
party and at the same time gratified his own
feelings by marrying the pretty marie vander
hey den and how he and heer antony had
many a merry and roving expedition together
i must not omit to say however that dolph
took his mother home to live with him and cherished
her in her old days the good dame too
had the satisfaction no longer hearing her son
made the theme censure on the contrary he
grew daily in public esteem every body spoke
well him and his wines and the loveliest
burgomaster was never known to decline his invitation
to dinner dolph often related at his
own table the wicked pranks which had once
been the abhorrence the town but they were
now considered excellent jokes and the gravest
dignitary was ready to die with laughing at them
no one was more struck with dolph's increasing
merit than his old master the doctor and
so forgiving was dolph in his temper that he
absolutely employed the doctor as his family
physician only taking care that his prescriptions
should always be thrown out the 
adolph heylioer
dow his mother had often her junto old
cronies to take a snug cup tea with her in her
comfortable little parlour and peter de groodt
as he sat by the fire side with one her grandchildren
on his knee would many a time congratulate
her upon her son's turning out so great
a man upon which the good old soul would
wag her head with exultation and exclaim ah
neighbour neighbour did i not say that dolph
would one day or other hold up his head with
the best them 
thus did dolph heyliger go on cheerily
and prosperously growing merrier as he grew
older and wiser and completely falsifying the
old proverb about money got over the devil's
back for he made good use his wealth and
became a distinguished citizen and a valuable
member the community he was a great
promoter public institutions such as beefsteak
societies and catch clubs he presided
at all public dinners and was the first that introduced
turtle from the west indies he improved
the breed race horses and game cocks 
adolph heyliger 
he was a great patron modest merit insomuch
that any one who could sing a good song
or tell a good story was sure to find a place at
his table and his benevolence became so well
known that every now and then a bantling was
laid at his door which he never failed to take
into the house and cherish as his own
he was a member too the corporation made
several laws for the protection game and oysters
and bequeathed to the board a large silver
punch bowl made out the identical porringer
before mentioned and which is in the possession
 the corporation to this very day
finally he died at a florid and jolly old age
 an apoplexy at a corporation feast and was
buried with great honours in the yard the little
dutch church in garden street where his
tombstone may still be seen with an epitaph in
dutch verse by his friend mynheer justus benson
an ancient and excellent poet the manbattles

the foregoing tale rests on better authority
than most tales the kind as i have it at second
 adolph heyliger
hand from the lips dolph hejliger himself
he never related it until towards the latter part
 his life and then in great confidence for he
was very discreet to a few particular cronies at
his own table over an extra bowl punch 
and strange as the hobgoblin parts the story
may seem there never was a single doubt expressed
on the subject by any his guests it
may not be amiss before concluding to observe
that in addition to his other accomplishments
dolph heyliger was noted for being the ablest
drawer the long bow in the whole province
the wedding
no more no more much honor aye betide
the lofty bridegroom and the lovely bride
that their succeeding days and years may say
each day appears like to a marriage day
braithttaite
the fair julia having recovered from the
effects her fall the day for the wedding was
at length appointed as it drew near there rose
several doubts and conversations between lady
lilly craft master simon and the parson on the
subject marrying in the month may 
against which i find there is an ancient prejudice
as being an unfortunate month for matrimony
from the discussions that took place
on these occasions i picked up much valuable
information relative to weddings such as that
if there were two celebrated in the same church
tol n 
 the wedding
on the same day the first would be happy the
second otherwise if in going to church they
should meet the funeral a female the bride
would die first if a male the bridegroom
if the new married couple were to dance together
on their wedding day the wife would
thenceforth rule the roast with many more curious
facts the same kind which made me
ponder more than ever upon the perils which
surround this happy state and how little men
know the awful risks they run in venturing upon
it i abstain however from enlarging on this
topic as i have no wish to promote the increase
 bachelors
the squire however though he gave due
weight to all these ancient saws yet had a host
 poetical authorities in favour this loving
month which i suppose were conclusive with
the young couple as i found they were perfectly
willing to marry in may and abide the consequences

the wedding has accordingly taken place at
the village church in presence a numerous
the wedding 
company relations and friends and many 
the tenantry the squire must needs have
something the old ceremonies observed on the
occasion so at the gate the churchyard
several little girls the village dressed in white
were in readiness with baskets flowers which
they strewed before the bride and the butler
bore before her the bride cup a great embossed
silver bowl one the family reliques from the
days the hard drinkers this was filled with
rich wine and decorated with a branch rosemary
tied with gay ribbands according to ancient
custom
happy is the bride that the sun shines on
says the old proverb and it was as sunny and
auspicious a morning as heart could wish the
bride looked uncommonly beautiful but in
fact what woman does not look interesting on her
wedding day there is something extremely
touching in the appearance a young and timid
bride in her robes virgin white led up trembling
to the altar when thus i behold a lovely
girl in the tenderness her years forsaking her
 the wedding
father's house and the home her childhood
and giving herself up with implicit confiding to
the man her choice in the good old language
 the ceremony for better for worse for
richer for poorer in sickness and in health to
love honour and obey till death us do part
it brings to my mind the beautiful self devotion
 ruth whither thou goes i will go and
where thou longest i will lodge thy people shall
be my people and thy god my god
the fair julia was supported on the trying
occasion by lady lillycraft whose heart was
overflowing with its wonted sympathy in all
matters love and matrimony as the bride
approached the altar her face would be one moment
covered with blushes and the next deadly
pale and she seemed almost ready to shrink from
sight among her female companions i do not
know what it is that makes every one serious
and as it were awe struck at a marriage ceremony
 which is generally considered as an occasion
 festivity and rejoicing as the ceremony
was performing i observed many a rosy
the wedding 
face among the country girls turn pale and i
did not see a smile throughout the church the
young ladies from the hall were almost as much
frightened as if it had been their own case and
stole many a look sympathy at their trembling
companion a tear stood in the eye the sensitive
lady lillycraft and as to phoebe wilkins
who was present the soft hearted baggage absolutely
wept and sobbed aloud but it is hard to
tell half the time what these fond foolish creatures
are crying about
the captain too though naturally gay and
unconcerned was much agitated on the occasion
and in attempting to put the ring upon the
bride's finger dropped it on the floor which i am
since told is a very lucky omen even master
simon had lost his usual vivacity and had assumed
a most whimsically solemn face which
he is apt to do on all occasions ceremony
he had much whispering with the parson and
parish clerk for he is always a busy personage
in the scene and he echoed the clerk's amen
with a solemnity and devotion that edified the
whole assemblage
 the wedding
the moment however that the ceremony
was over the transition was magical the
bride cup was passed round according to ancient
usage for the company to drink to a
happy union every one's feelings seemed to
break forth from restraint master simon had a
world bachelor pleasantries to utter and
as to the gallant general he bowed and cooed
about the dulcet lady lillycraft like a mighty
cock pigeon about his dame
the villagers gathered in the churchyard to
cheer the happy couple as they left the church
and the musical tailor had marshalled his band
and set up a hideous discord as the blushing
and smiling bride passed through a lane honest
peasantry to her carriage the children
shouted and threw up their hats the bells rang
a merry peal that threatened to bring down the
battlements the old tower and set all the
crows and rooks flying and cawing about the
air and there was a continual popping off 
rusty firelock from every part the neighbourhood

the wedding 
the prodigal son distinguished himself on
the occasion but had nearly done mischief as
the horses the bride's carriage took fright
from the discharge a row old gun barrels
which he had mounted as a park artillery in
front the school house to give the captain a
military salute as he passed
the day passed off with great rustic rejoin
kings tables were spread under the trees in
the park where all the peasantry the neighbourhood
were regaled with roast beef and
plum pudding and oceans ale ready money
jack presided at one the tables and became
so full good cheer as to unbend from
his usual gravity sing a song out all tune
and give two or three shouts laughter that
almost electrified his neighbours like so many
peals thunder slingsbyby the schoolmaster
and the apothecary vied with each
other in making speeches over their liquor and
there were occasional glees and musical performances
by the village band that must have
 the wedding
frightened every fawn and dryad from the
park
old christy even was warmed into a flow on
the occasion he appeared newly equipped
from top to toe with bright leather breeches
and a great wedding favour flaunting in his
jockey cap the old man drank health and
happiness to the young couple at least a dozen
times and ended by dancing a hornpipe on
one the tables to the great astonishment 
the whole world
equal gayety reigned within doors where a
large party friends were entertained everyone
laughed at his own pleasantry without attending
to that his neighbour's the bride
cup was carried about according to ancient form
and loads bride cake distributed the young
ladies were all busy in passing morsels cake
through the wedding ring to dream on and i
myself assisted a fine little boarding school girl
in putting up a quantity for her companions
which i have no doubt will set all the little
heads in the school gadding for a week to come
the wedding 
in the evening we were entertained by a display
 fireworks got up by the schoolmaster
and apothecary with the assistance the prodigal
son whom the squire talks making his
gamekeeper by way reward for his extraordinary
services the village also was generally
illuminated excepting the house the radical
who has not shown his face during the rejoin
kings
one wedding makes many says an old proverb
and i should not be surprised if it holds
good in the present instance i have seen several
flirtations among the young people that have
been brought together on this occasion master
simon however has told me in great confidence
that he thinks the old general's case is
desperate with lady lillycraft she having determined
that he is quite destitute sentiment
it is with some concern therefore that i have
seen him throwing away tender glances upon
her at the w r adding dinner during the changing
 the dishes
i am told moreover that young jack tibi
 
 the wedding
bets was so touched by the wedding ceremony
at which he was present and captivated by the
sensibility poor phoebe wilkins that he had
a reconciliation with her that very day after dinner
in one the groves the park and danced
with her at the village in the evening to the
complete confusion old dame tibbets
domestic politics
what is more lady lillycraft who with her
usual benevolence in all concerns the heart
had lately taken an interest in this love affair
on hearing the reconciliation the lovers
undertook the critical task breaking the matter
to ready money jack she thought there
was no time like the present and attacked the
sturdy old yeoman that very evening in the park
while his heart was yet lifted up with the squire's
good cheer jack was a little surprised at being
drawn aside by her ladyship but was not to be
flurried by such anhonour he was still more
surprised by the nature her communication 
and this first intelligence an affair that had
been passing under his eye he listened howthe
wedding 
ever with his usual gravity as her ladyship represented
the advantages the match the good
qualities the girl and the distress which all
parties had lately suffered at length his eye began
to kindle and his hand to play with the
head his cudgel lady lillycraft saw that
something in the narrative had gone wrong
and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating
the soft hearted phoebe's merit and
fidelity and her great unhappiness when old
ready money suddenly interrupted her by
exclaiming that if jack did not marry the
wench he'd break every bone in his body 
the match therefore is considered a settled
thing dame tibbets and the housekeeper have
made friends and drank tea together and phoebe
has again recovered her good looks and good
spirits and is caroling from morning till night
like a lark
but the most whimsical caprice cupid is
one that i should be almost afraid to mention
did i not know that i was writing for readers
well experienced in the waywardness this
 the wedding
most mischievous deity the morning after
the wedding therefore while lady lillycraft
was making preparations for her departure an
audience was requested by her immaculate handmaid
mrs hannah who with much primming
 the mouth and many maidenly hesitations
requested leave to stay behind and that lady
lillycraft would supply her place with some
other servant her ladyship was thunderstruck 
what hannah going to quit her that had lived
with her so long 
why one could not help it one must settle
in life some time or other
the good lady was still lost in amazement 
at length the secret was gasped from the dry
lips the maiden gentlewoman she had been
some time thinking changing her condition
and at length had given her word last evening
to mr christy the huntsman 
how or when or where this singular courtship
had been carried on i have not been able to
learn or how she has been able with the vinegar
 her disposition to soften the stony heart
the wedding 
 old nimrod so however it is and it has
astonished every one with all her ladyship's
love match making this last fume hymen's
torch has been too much for her she
has endeavoured to reason with mrs hannah
but all in vain her mind was made up and she
grew tart on the least contradiction lady lily
applied to the squire for his interference 
she did not know what she should do without
mrs hannah she had been used to have her
about her so long a time
the squire on the contrary rejoiced in the
match as relieving the good lady from a kind 
toilette tyrant under whose sway she had suffered
for years instead thwarting the affair
therefore he has given it his full countenance
and declares that he will set up the young
couple in one the best cottages on his estate
the approbation the squire has been followed
by that the whole household they all
declare that if ever matches are really made in
heaven this must have been for that old
christy and mrs hannah were as cordially
 the wedding
formed to be linked together as ever were 
box and vinegar cruet
is soon as this matter was arranged lady
lillyiaft took her leave the family at the
hall taking with her the captain and his blushing
bride who are to pass the honeymoon with
her master simon accompanied them on
horseback and indeed means to ride on a head
to make preparations the general who was
fishing in vain for an invitation to her seat
handed her ladyship into her carriage with a
heavy sigh upon which his bosom friend master
simon who was just mounting his horse
gave me a knowing wink made an abominably
wry face and leaning from his saddle whispered
loudly in my ear it wont do then putting
spurs to his horse away he cantered off
the general stood for some time waving his
hat after the carriage as it rolled down the
avenue until he was seized with a fit sneezing
from exposing his head to the cool breeze
the company have now almost all taken
their departure i have determined to do the
the wedding 
same tomorrow morning and i hope my reader
may not think that i have already lingered too
long at the ball i have been tempted to do so
however because i thought i had lit upon one
 the retired places where there are yet some
traces to be met with old english character
a little while hence and all these will have
passed away
ready money jack will sleep with his fathers
the good squire and all his peculiarities
will be buried in the parish church the old
hall will be modernized into a fashionable
country seat or pera venture a manufactory
the park will be cut up into kitchen gardens
a daily coach will run through the village and
it will become like all other commonplace villages
thronged with coachmen postboys tipplers
and politicians and christmas mayday
and all their hearty merrymakings will be
forgotten

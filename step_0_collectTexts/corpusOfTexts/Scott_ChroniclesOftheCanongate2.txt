we must now leave the lower parties in ons
historical drama to attend to the incidents
which took place among those a higher rank
and greater importance
we pass from the hut an armourer to the
councilroom a monarch and resume our
story just when the tumult beneath being settled
the angry chieftains were summoned to
the royal presence they entered displeased
with and lowering upon each other each so exclusively
filled with his own fancied injuries as
to be equally unwilling and unable to attend to
reason or argument albany alone calm and
crafty seemed prepared to use their dissatisfaction
for his own purposes and turn each incident
as it should occur to the furtherance his
own indirect ends
the king's irresolution although it amounted
even to timidity did not prevent his assuming
the exterior appearance dignity becoming
his situation it was only when hard
pressed as in the preceding scene that he lost
his apparent composure in general he might
be driven from his purpose but seldom from
his dignity manner he received albany
douglas march and the prior those illassorted
members his motley council with a
mixture courtesy and dignity which reminded
each haughty peer that he stood in the presence
 his sovereign and compelled him todo
the beseeming reverence
hang received their salutations the king
motioned them to be seated and they were
obeying his commands when rothsay entered
he walked gracefully up to his father and
kneeling at his footstool requested his blessing
robert with a look in which fondness and sorrow
were ill disguised made an attempt to assume
a look reproof as he laid his hand on
the youth's head and said with a sigh god
bless thee my thoughtless boy and make thee a
wiser man in thy future years 
amen my dearest father i said rothsay
in a tone feeling such as his happier moments
often evinced he then kissed the royal hand
with the reverence a son and a subject and
instead taking a place at the council board
remained standing behind the king's chair in
such a position that he might when he chose
whisper into his father's ear
the king then made a sign to the prior 
st dominic to take his place at the table on
which there were writing materials which 
all the subjects present albany excepted the
churchman was alone able to use the king
then opened the purpose their meeting by
saying with much dignity
our business my lords respected these
iiuhiippy dissensions in the highlands which we
learn by our latest messengers are about to occasion
the waste and destruction the country
even within a few miles this our own court
but near as this trouble is our ill fate and the
instigation wicked men have raised up one
yet nearer by throwing strife and contention
among the citizens perth and those attendants
who follow your lordships and others our
knights and nobles i must first therefore
apply to yourselves my lords to know why our
court is disturbed by such unseemly contending
and by what means they ought to be repressed
 brother albany do you tell us first
your sentiments on this matter
sir our royal sovereign and brother said
uic duke being in attendance on your person
when the fray began i am not acquainted
with its origin
 and for me said the prince i heard no
worse warcry than a minstrel wench's ballad
and saw no more dangerous bolts flying than
hazel nuts
and i said the earl march could onl v
perceive that the stout citizens perth had iu
chase some knaves who had assumed the bloody
heart on their shoulders they ran too fast to
be actually the men the earl douglas
douglas understood the sneer but only replied
to it by one those withering looks with
which he was accustomed to intimate his mortal
resentment he spoke however with haughty
composure
my liege he said must course know
it is douglas who must answer to this heavy
charge for when was there strife or bloodshed
in scotland but there were foul tongues to asperse
a douglas or a douglas's man as having
given cause to them we have here goodly
witnesses i speak not my lord albany
who has only said that he was as well becomes
him by your grace's side and i say nothing
 my lord rothsay who as befits his rank
years and understanding was cracking nuts
with a strolling musician he smiles here
he may say his pleasure i shall not forget a
tie which he seems to have forgotten but here
is my lord march who saw my followers
flying before the clowns perth i can tell
that earl that the followers the bloody heart
advance or retreat when their chieftain commands
and the good scotland requires
and i can answer exclaimed the equally
proud earl march his blood rushing into
his face when the king interrupted him
 peace angry lords said the king and
remember in whose presence you stand and
you my lord douglas tell us if you can
the cause this mutiny and why your followers
whose general good services we are most
willing to acknowledge were thus active in
private brawl 
i obey my lord said douglas slightly
stooping a head that seldom bent i was
passing from my lodgings in the carthusian
convent through the high street perth
with a few my ordinary retinue when i beheld
some the baser sort crowding around
the cross against which there were nailed this
placard and that which accompanies it
he took from a pocket in the bosom his
buffcoat a human hand and a piece parchment
the king was shocked and agitated
read he said good father prior and
let that ghastly spectacle be removed
the prior read a placard to the following
purpose 
inasmuch as the house a citizen 
perth was assaulted last night being st valentine's
eve by a sort disorderly nightwalkers
belonging to some company the
strangers now resident in the fair city and
whereas this hand was struck from one the
lawless glimmers in the fray that ensued the
provost and magistrates have directed that it
should be nailed to the cross in scorn and
contempt those by whom such brawl was
occasioned and if any one knightly degree
shall say that this our act is wrongfully done
i patrick charteris kinfauns knight will
justify this cartel in knightly weapons within
the barrack or if any one meaner birth
shall deny what is here said he shall be met
with by a citizen the fair city perth according
to his degree and so god and st
john protect the fail city 
you will not wonder my lord resumed
douglas that when my almoner had read tome
the contents so insolent a scroll i caused
one my squires to pluck down a trophy so disgraceful
to the chivalry and nobility scotland
whereupon it seems some these saucy burghers
took license to hoot and insult the hindmost
 my train who wheeled their horses on them
and would soon have settled the feud but for
my positive command that they should follow
me in as much peace as the rascally vulgar
would permit and thus they arrived here in
the guise flying men when with my command
to repel force by force they might have
set fire to the four corners this wretched
borough and stifled the insolent churls like
foxcubs in a burning brake furze
there was a silence when douglas had done
speaking until the duke rothsay answered
addressing his father 
since the earl douglas possesses the
power burning the town where your grace
holds your court so soon as the provost and
he differ about a night riot oi the terms a
cartel am sure we ought all to be thankful
that he has not the will to do so
 the duke rothsay said douglas who
seemed resolved to maintain command his
temper may have reason to thank heaven ina
more serious tone than he now uses that the
douglas is as true as he is powerful this is a
time when the subjects in all countries rise
against the law we have heard the insurgents
 the jacquerie in france and jack
straw and hob miller and parson ball
among the southron and we may be sure there
is fuel enough to catch such a flame were it
spreading to our frontiers when i see peasants
challenging noblemen and nailing the
hands the gentry to their city cross i will
not say i fear mutiny for that would be false
but i foresee and will stand well prepared
for it
and why does my lord douglas say answered
the earl march that this cartel
has been done by churls i see sir patrick
charteris name there and he i ween is no
ehurps blood the douglas himself since he
takes the matter so warmly might lift sir
patrick's gauntlet without soiling his honour

my lord march replied douglas
should speak but what he understands i
do no injustice to the descendant the red
rover when i say he is too slight to be weighed
with the douglas the heir thomas
randolph might have a better claim to be answered

and by ray honour it shall not miss for
want my asking the grace said the earl 
march pulling his glove off
stay my lord said the king do us not
so gross an injury as to bring your feud to
mortal defiance here but rather offer your ungloved
hand in kindness to the noble earl and
embrace in token your mutual fealty to the
crown scotland
not so my liege answered march your
majesty may command me to return my gauntlet
for that and all the armour it belongs to are
at your command while i continue to hold my
earldom the crown scotland but when i
clasp douglas it must be with a mailed baud
farewell my liege my counsels here avail not
and those others are so favourably received
that perhaps farther stay were unwholesome for
my safety may god keep your highness from
open enemies and treacherous friends i am
for my castle dunbar from whence i think
you will soon hear news farewell to you
my lords albany and douglas you are
playing a high game look you play it fairly 
farewell poor thoughtless prince who art
sporting like a fawn within spring a tiger 
farewell all george dunbar sees the evil
he cannot remedy adieu all
the king would have spoken but the accents
died on his tongue as he received from
albany a look cautioning him to forbear the
earl march left the apartment receiving
the mute salutations the members the
council whom he had severally addressed excepting
from douglas alone who returned to
his farewell speech a glance contemptuous
defiance
the recreant goes to betray us to the
southron he said his pride rests on his
possessing that seaworn hold which can admit
the english into lothian nay look not
alarmed my liege i will hold good what i say
nevertheless it is yet time speak bat the
word my liege say but arrest him and
march shall not yet cross the earn on his traitorous
journey
nay gallant earl said albany who wished
rather that the two powerful lords should
counterbalance each other than that one should
obtain a decisive superiority that were too
hasty counsel the earl march came hither
on the king's warrant safeconduct and it
may not consist with my royal brother's honour
to break it yet if your lordship can bring
any detailed proof 
here they were interrupted by a flourish 
trumpets
 his grace albany is unwontedly scrupulous
today said douglas but it skills
not wasting words the time is past these are
march's trumpets and i warrant me he rides
at flight speed so soon as he passes the south
port we shall hear him in time and if it
be as i have conjectured he shall be met with
though all england backed his treachery
nay let us hope better the noble earl
 march said the king no way displeased
that the quarrel betwixt march and douglas
had seemed to obliterate the traces the disagreement
betwixt rothsay and his fatherinlaw
 he hath a fiery but not a sullen temper
in some things he has been i will not say
wronged but disappointed and something is
to be allowed to the resentment high blood
armed with great power but thank heaven all
 us who remain are one sentiment and 
one house so that at least our councils cannot
now be thwarted with disunion father prior
i pray you take your writing materials for you
must as usual be our clerk council and
now to business my lords and our first object
 consideration must be this highland
cumber
between the clan chateau and the clan
quhele or kay said the prior which as
our last advices from our brethren at ducked
inform us is ready to break out into a more formidable
warfare than has yet taken place between
these sons belial who speak noli

thing else than utterly destroying one another
their forces are assembling on each
side and not a man claiming in the tenth degree
 kindred but must repair to the brateach
 his tribe or stand to the punishment
 fire and sword the fiery cross hath fled like
a meteor in every direction and awakened
strange and unknown tribes beyond the distant
murray firth may heaven and st dominic be
our protection but if your lordships cannot
find remedy for evil it will spread broad and
wide and the patrimony the church must
in every direction be exposed to the fury 
these amalekite with whom there is as little
devotion to heaven as there is pity or love to
their neighbours may our lady be our guard 
we hear some them are yet utter heathens
and worship mahound and termagant
 my lords and kinsmen said robert ye 
have heard the urgency this case and may
standard literally cloth the lowland language still
retains the word irate which however is only applicable to a
child's pinafore or a coarse towel to such mean offices nine
words descend
desire to know my sentiments before you deliver
what your own wisdom shall suggest and in
sooth no better remedy occurs to me than to
send two commissioners with full power from
us to settle such debates as be among them 
and at the same time to charge them as they
shall be answerable to the law to lay down their
arms and forbear all practices violence against
each other
i approve your grace's proposal said
rothsay and i trust the good prior will not
refuse the venerable station envoy upon this
peacemaking errand and his reverend brother
the abbot the carthusian convent must
contend for an honour which will certainly add
two most eminent recruits to the large army 
martyrs since the highlanders little regard the
distinction betwixt clerk and layman in the
ambassadors whom you send to them
my royal lord rothsay said the prior
if i am destined to the blessed crown mart
jadom i shall be doubtless directed to the path
y which i am tn attain it meantime if you
vot it r
speak in jest may heaven pardon you and give
you light to perceive that it were better buckle
on your arms to guard the possessions the
church so perilously endangered than to employ
your wit in taunting her ministers and
servants
i taunt no one father prior said the
youth yawning nor have i much objection
to taking arms excepting that they are a somewhat
cumbrous garb and in february a furred
mantle is more suiting the weather than a
steel corslet and it irks me the more to put
on cold harness in this nipping weather that
would but the church send a detachment 
their saints and they have some highland
ones well known in this district and doubtless
used to the climate they might fight their
own battles like merry st george england
but i know not how it is we hear their
miracles when they are propitiated and their
vengeance if any one trespasses on their patrimonies
and these are urged as reasons for extending
their lands by large largesses and yet
if there come down but a band twenty highlanders
bell and candle make no speed
and the belted baron must be fain to maintain
the church in possession the lands which he
has given to her as much as if he himself still
enjoyed the fruits them
son robert said his father jou give
an undue license to your tongue
nay sir i am mute replied the prince
i had no purpose to disturb your highness
or displease the father prior who with so
many miracles at his disposal will not face as
it seems a handful highland catherine
we know said the prior with suppressed
indignation from what source these vile
doctrines are derived which we hear with horror
from the tongue your highness when
princes converse with heretics their minds and
manners are alike corrupted they show themselves
in the streets as the companions masters
and harlots and in the council as the scorners
 the church and holy things
peace good father said the king
 rothsav shall make amends for what he has
idly spoken alas let us take counsel in friendly
fashion rather than resemble a mutinous
crew mariners in a sinking vessel when
each is more intent on quarrelling with his
neighbours than in assisting the exertions 
the forlorn master for the safety the ship 
my lord douglas your house has been seldom
to lack when the crown scotland desired
either wise counsel or manly achievement 
i trust you will help us in this strait 
i can only wonder that the strait should
exist my lord answered the haughty douglas
 when i was intrusted with the lieutenancy
 the kingdom there were some 
these wild clans came down from the grampian
i troubled not the council about the
matter but made the sheriff lord ruthven
get to horse with the forces the carse the
hays the lindsay the oxides and other
gentlemen by st bride when it was steel
coat to frieze mantle the thieves knew what
lances were good for and whether swords had
edges or no there were some three hundred
 their best bonnets besides that their chief
donald cognac left on the moor thorn
and in rochinroy wood j and as many were
gibbeted at ploughman stairs which has still
the name from the hangman work that was don
there this is the way men deal with thieves
in my country and if gentler methods will succeed
better with these parish knaves do not
blame douglas for speaking his mind you
smile my lord rothsay may i ask how i
have a seconc time become your jest before i
have replied to the first which you passed on
me 
nay be not wrathful my good lord 
douglas answered the prince i did but
smile to think how your princely retinue would
dwindle if every thief were dealt with as the
poor highlanders at ploughman stairs
the king again interfered to prevent the earl
from giving an angry reply your lordship
said he to douglas advises wisely that we
should trust to arms when these men come out
against our subjects on the fair and level plain 
 some authorities place this skirmish so late as 
but the difficulty is to put a stop to their disorders
while they continue to lurk within their
mountains i need not tell you that the clan
ciiattan and the clan kay are great confederacies
consisting each various tribes who arc
banded together each to support their own separate
league and who late have had dissensions
which have drawn blood wherever they
have met whether individually or in bands
the whole country is torn to pieces by their
restless feuds
i cannot see the evil this said the
douglas the ruffians will destroy each other
and the deer the highlands will increase as
the men diminish we shall gain as hunters
the exercise we lose as warriors
rather say that the wolves will increase as
the men diminish replied the king
i am content said douglas better
wild wolves than wild highlanders let there
be strong forces maintained along the highland
frontier to separate the quiet from the disturbed
country confine the fire civil war within
the highlands let it spend its uncontrolled
fury and it will be soon burnt out for want 
fuel the survivors will be humbled and will
be more obedient to a whisper your grace's
pleasure than their fathers or the knaves that
now exist have been to your strictest commands

this is wise but ungodly counsel said the
prior shaking his head i cannot take it upon
my conscience to recommend it it is wisdom
but it is the wisdom achitophel crafty at
once and cruel
my heart tells me so said robert laying
his hand on his breast my heart tells me
that it will be asked me at the awful day
robert stewart where are the subjects i have
given thee it tells me that i must account for
them all saxon and gael lowland highland
and border man that i will not be required to
answer for those alone who have wealth and
knowledge but for those also who were robbers
because they were poor and rebels because they
were ignorant
you highness speaks like a christian
king said the prior but you bear the
sword his well as the sceptre and this present
evil is a kind which the sword must cure
 hark ye my lords said the prince
looking up as if a gay thought had suddenly
struck him suppose we teach these savage
mountaineers a strain chivalry it were no
hard matter to bring these two great commanders
the captain the clan chateau and
the chief the no less doughty race the
clan quhele to defy each other to mortal combat
they might fight here in perth we
would lend them horse and armour thus their
fend would be stanched by the death one or
probably both the villains for i think both
avould break their necks in the first charge
my father's godly desire saving blood would
be attained and we should have the pleasure
 seeing such a combat between two salvage
knights for the first time in their lives wearing
breeches and mounted on horses as has
not been heard since the days king 

shame upon yon son robert said the
kiig do you make the distress your butime
country and the perplexity our councils
a subject for buffoonery 
 if you will pardon me royal brother said
albany i think that though my princely
nephew hath started this thought in a jocular
manner there may be something wrought out
 it which might greatly remedy this pressing
evil
good brother replied the king it is
unkind to expose rothsay's folly by pressing
further his illtimed jest we know the highland
clans have not our customs chivalry
nor the habit or mode doing battle which these
require
true royal brother answered albany 
yet i speak not in scorn but in serious earnest
true the mountaineers have not our forms and
mode doing battle in the lists but they have
those which are as effectual to the destruction 
human life and so that the mortal game is played
and the stake won and lost what signifies it
whether these gael fight with sword and lance
as becomes belted knights or with sandbags
like the restless churls england or butcher

each other with knives and skeans in their own
barbarous fashion their habits like our own
refer all disputed rights and claims to the decision
 battle they are as vain too as they
are fierce and the idea that these two clans
would be admitted to combat in presence your
grace and your court will readily induce
them to refer their difference to the fate battle
even were such rough arbitrement less familiar
to their customs and that in any such
numbers as shall be thought most convenient
we must take care that they approach not the
court save in such a fashion and number that
they shall not be able to surprise us and that
point being provided against the more that shall
be admitted to combat upon either side the
greater will be the slaughter among their bravest
and most stirring men and the more the
chance the highlands being quiet for sometime
to come
this were a bloody policy brother said
the king and again i say that i cannot bring
my conscience to countenance the slaughter 
these rude men that are so little better than so
many benighted heathens
 and are their lives more precious asked
albany than those nobles and gentlemen
who by your grace's license are so frequently
admitted to fight in barrack either for the satisfying
 disputes at law or simply to acquire
honour 
the king thus hard pressed had little to say
against a custom so engrafted upon the laws 
the realm and the usages chivalry as the trial
by combat and he only replied god knows
i have never granted such license as you urge
we with unless with the greatest repugnance 
and that i never saw men have strife together
to the effusion blood but i could have wished
to appease it with the shedding my
own
but my gracious lord said the prior it
seems that if we follow not some such policy as
this my lord albany we must have recourse
to that the douglas and at the risk
 the dubious event battle and with the
certainty losing many excellent subjects do
by means the lowland swords that which
these wild mountaineers will otherwise perform
with their owu hand what says my lord 
douglas to the policy his grace albany 
douglas said the haughty lord never
counselled that to be done by policy which
might be attained by open force he remains
by his opinion and is willing to march at the
head his own followers with those the
barons perthshire and the carse and either
bring these highlanders to reason or subjection
or leave the body a douglas among their savage
wildernesses
it is nobly said my lord douglas said
albany and well might the king rely upon
thy undaunted heart and the courage thy
resolute followers but see you not how soon
you may be called elsewhere where your presence
and services are altogether indispensable
to scotland and her monarch marked you
not the gloomy tone in which the fiery earl 
march limited his allegiance and faith to our
sovereign here present to that space for which
he was to remain king robert's vassal and
did not you yourself suspect that he was plotting
a transference his allegiance to england
 other chiefs subordinate power and
inferior fame may do battle with the highlanders
 but if march admit the perches and
their englishmen into our frontiers who will
drive them back if the douglas be elsewhere 
my sword answered douglas is equally
at the service his majesty on the frontier
or in the deepest recesses the highlands
i have seen the backs the proud percy and
george dunbar ere now and i may see them
again and if it is the king's pleasure i should
take measures against this probable conjunction
 stranger and traitor i admit that rather than
trust to an inferior or feebler hand the important
task settling the highlands i would be disposed
to give my opinion in favour the policy
 my lord albany and suffer those savages
to carve each other's limbs without giving
barons and knights the trouble hunting
them down
my lord douglas said the prince
who seemed determined to omit no opportunity
to gall his haughty fatherinlaw does not
choose to leave to us lowlanders even the poor
crumbs honour which might be gathered at
the expense the highland kerne while he
with his border chivalry reaps the full harvest
 victory over the english but percy hath
seen men's backs as well as douglas and i
have known as great wonders as that he who
goes forth to seek such wool should come back
shorn
a phrase said douglas well becoming
a prince who speaks honour with a wandering
harlot's scrip in his bonnet by way favour

excuse it my lord said rothsay men
who have fetched unwittingly become careless
in the choice those whom they love par
amours the chained dog must snatch at the
nearest bone
rothsay my unhappy son exclaimed the
king art thou mad or wouldst thou draw
down on thee the full storm a king and father's
displeasure 
 i am dumb returned the prince at your
grace's command
 well then my lord albany said the
king since such is your advice and since
scottish blood must flow how i pray you are
we to prevail on these fierce men to refer their
quarrel to such a combat as you propose 
that my liege said albany 
your words seem to aim at some one in this
presence father prior said the douglas if
at me they do me foul wrong i am well aware
that the abbot aberbrothick hath made
some illadvised complaints that i suffered not
his beeves to become too many for his pastures
or his stock grain to burst the girls
 the monastery while my followers lacked
beef and their horses corn but bethink you
the pastures and cornfields which produced that
plenty were bestowed by my ancestors on the
house aberbrothick surely not with the purpose
that their descendant should starve in the
midst it and neither will he by st bride 
but for heresy and false doctrine he added
striking his large hand heavily on the counciltable
 who is it that dare tax the douglas i
would not have poor men burned for silly
thoughts but my hand and sword are ever ready
to maintain the christian faith
my lord i doubt it not said the prior so
hath il ever been with your most noble house
m
fot the ablots complaints they may pass to
a second day but what we now desire is a
commission to some noble lord state joined
to others holy church to support by strength
 hand if necessary the inquiries which the
reverend official the bounds and other grave
prelates my unworthy self being one are about
to make into the cause the new doctrines
which are now deluding the simple and depraving
the pure and precious faith approved
by the holy father and his reverend predecessors

 let the earl douglas have a royal commission
to this effect said albany and let
there be no exception whatever from his jurisdiction
saving the royal person for my own
part although conscious that i have neither in
act nor thought received or encouraged a doctrine
which holy church hath not sanctioned
yet i should blush to claim an immunity under
the blood royal scotland lest i should seem
to be seeking refuge against a crime so horrible

i will have nought to do with it said
douglas to march against the english and
the southron traitor march is task enough forme
moreover i am a true scotsman and
will not give way to aught that may put the
church scotland's head farther into the roman
yoke or make the barons coronet stoop to
the mitre and cowl do thou therefore most
noble duke albany place your own name
in the commission and i pray your grace so
to mitigate the zeal the men holy church
who may be associated with you that there be
no over zealous dealings for the smell a
faggot on the tay would bring back the douglas
from the walls york
the duke hastened to give the earl assurance
that the commission should be exercised with
lenity and moderation
ff without a question said king robert
the commission must be ample and did it
consist with the dignity our crown we would
not ourselves decline its jurisdiction but we
trust that while the thunders the church
are directed against the vile authors these
detestable heresies there shall bs measures 
mildness and compassion taken with the unfortunate
victims their delusions riajnoci m
such is ever the course holy church
my lord said the prior st dominic's
 why then let the commission be expedited
with due care in name our brother
albany and such others as shall be deemed convenient
said the king and now once again
let us break up our council and rothsay como
thou with me and lend me thine arm i have
matter for thy private earciooasb ad ybtndm
ho la exclaimed the prince in the tone
in which he would have addressed a managed
horse
om trim iins
wod utuimoq slt
yo more fear than danger i fancy answered
the prince but how can i tell the men who
made this nocturnal disturbance 
there was a follower thine own there
continued the king a man belhal whom
i will have brought to condign punishment
i have no follower to my knowledge capable
 deserving your highnesses displeasure
answered the prince
 i will have no evasions boy where wert
thou on st valentine's eve n x
it is to be hoped that i was serving the
good saint as a man mould might answered
the young man carelessly
 will my royal nephew tell us how his master
 the horse was employed upon that holy
eve said the duke albania 
speak robert i command thee to speak
said the king as ai bodes o
ramorny was employed in my service i
think that answer may satisfy my uncle
 but it will not satisfy wie said the angry
father god knows i never coveted man's
blood but that ramorny's head i will have if
law can give it he has been the encourager
and partaker all thy numerous vices and follies
i will take care he shall be so no more 
call maclouis with a guard 
 do not injure an innocent man interposed
the prince desirous at every sacrifice to preserve
his favourite from the menaced danger 
i pledge my word that ramorny was employed
in business mine therefore could not
be engaged in this brawl
ff false equivocator that thou art said the
king presenting to the prince a ring behold
the signet ramorny lost in the infamous affray
 it fell into the hands a follower the
douglas and was given by the earl to my brother
speak not for ramorny for he dies and
go thou from my presence and repent the flava

nitrous councils which could make thee stand
before me with a falsehood in thy mouth oh
shame robin shame as a son thou hast lied
to thy father as a knight to the head thy
order
the prince stood before his father mute 
and selfconvicted he then gave
way to the honourable feelings which at bottom
he really possessed and threw himself at his
father's feet
the false knight he said deserves degradation
the disloyal subject death but oh 
let the son crave from the father pardon for the
servant who did not lead him into guilt but who
reluctantly plunged himself into it at his command
 let me bear the weight my own folly
but spare those who have been my tools
rather than my accomplices remember ramorn
was preferred to my service by my sainted
mother
name her not robin i charge thee said
the king she is happy that she never saw
the child her love stand before her doubly
dishonoured by guilt and by falsehood
 am indeed unworthy to name ber said
the prince and yet my dear father in her
name i must petition for ramorny's life
 if i might offer my counsel said the duke
 albany who saw that a reconciliation would
soon take place betwixt the father and son i
would advise that ramorny be dismissed from
the prince's household and society with such
further penalty as his imprudence may seem to
merit the public will be contented with his
disgrace and the matter will be easily accommodated
or stifled so that his highness do not
attempt to screen his servant
wilt thou for my sake robin said the
king with a faltering voice and the tear in
his eye dismiss this dangerous man for my
sake who could not refuse thee the heart out
 my bosom 
it shall be done my father done instantly
the prince replied and seizing the pen he
wrote a hasty dismissal ramorny from his
service and put it into albany's hands i
would i could fulfil all your wishes as easily
my royal father he added throwing himself at
n
the king's feet who raised him up and fondly
folded him in his arms
albany scowled but was silent and it was
not till after the space a minute or two that
he said this matter being so happily accommodated
let me ask if your majesty is pleased
to attend the evensong service in the chapel
r
ij
surely said the king have i not
thanks to pay to god who has restored union
to my family you will go with us brother 
so please your grace to give me leave 
absence no said the duke i must concert
with the douglas and others the manner in
which we may bring these highland vultures
to our lure r r r 
albany retired to think over his ambitious
projects while the father and son attended divine
service to thank god for their happy reconciliation

chapter 
a former chapter opened in the royal confessional
 we are now to introduce our readers
to a situation somewhat similar though the
scene and persons were very different instead
 a gothic and darkened apartment in a monastery
one the most beautiful prospects in
scotland lay extended beneath the hill kinsoul
and at the foot a rock which commanded
the view in every direction sat the
fair maid perth listening in an attitude 
devout attention to the instructions a carthusian
monk in his white gown and scapular
who concluded his discourse with prayer
in which his proselyte devoutly joined
when they had finished their devotions the
priest sat for some time with his eyes fixed on
the glorious prospect which even the early
and chilly season could not conceal the beauties
and it was some time ere he addressed his
attentive companion
when i behold he said at length this
rich and varied land with its castles churches
convents stately palaces and fertile fields these
extensive woods and that noble river i know
not my daughter whether most to admire the
bounty god or the ingratitude man he
hath given us the beauty and fertility the
earth and we have made the scene his bounty
a charnelhouse and a battlefield he hath
given us power over the elements and skill to
erect houses for comfort and defence and we
have converted them into dens for robbers and
ruffians
yet surely my father there is room for
comfort replied catharine even in the very
prospect we look upon yonder four goodly
convents with their churches and their towers
which tell the citizens with brazen voice that
they should think on their religious duties 
their inhabitants who have separated themselves
from the world its pursuits and its pleasures
to dedicate themselves to the service 
heaven all bear witness that if scotland bea
bloody and a sinful land she is yet alive and
sensible to the claims which religion demands
 the human race
verily daughter what you say seems truth 
and yet nearly viewed too much the comfort
you describe will be found delusive it is true
there was a period in the christian world when
good men maintaining themselves by the work
 their hands assembled together not that
they might live easily or sleep softly but that
they might strengthen each other in the christian
faith and qualify themselves to be teachers
 the word to the people doubtless there
are still such to be found in the holy edifices on
which we now look but it is to be feared
that the love many has waxed cold our
churchmen have become wealthy as well by
the gifts pious persons as by the bribes
which wicked men have given in their ignorance
imagining that they can purchase that
pardon for endowments to the church which
heaven has only offered to sincere penitents
and thus as the church waxeth rich her doc i
trines have unhappily become dim and obscure
as a light is less seen if placed in a lamp 
chased gold than beheld through a screen 
glass god knows if i see these things and
mark them it is from no wish singularity or
desire to make myself a teacher in israel but
because the fire burns in my bosom and will
not permit me to be silent i obey the rules 
my order and withdraw not myself from its
austerities be they essential to our salvation
or be they mere formalities adopted to supply
the want real penitence and sincere devotion
i have promised nay vowed to observe them 
and they shall be respected by me the more
that otherwise i might be charged with regarding
my bodily ease when heaven is my witness
how lightly i value what i may be called on to
volet d
act or suffer if the purity the church could
be restored or the discipline the priesthood
replaced in its primitive simplicity
but my father said catharine even
for these opinions men term you a lollard and
a wickliffe and say it is your desire to destroy
churches and cloisters and restore the
religion heathenism
even so my daughter am i driven to seek
refuge in hills and rocks and must be presently
contented to take my flight amongst the
rude highlanders who are thus far in a more
gracious state than those i leave behind me
that theirs are crimes ignorance not 
presumption i will not omit to take such
means safety and escape from their cruelty
as heaven may open to me for while such appear
i shall account it a sign that i have still
a service to accomplish but when it is my
master's pleasure he knows how willingly
clement blair will lay down a vilified life upon
earth in humble hope a blessed exchange
hereafter but wherefore dost thou look northward
so anxiously my child thy young eyes
are quicker than mine dost thou see any one
coming 
i look father for the highland youth conachar
who will be thy guide to the hills where
his father can afford thee a safe if a rude retreat
this he has often promised when we
spoke you and your lessons i fear he is
now in company where he will soon forget
them
 the youth hath sparkles grace in him
said father clement although those his
race are usually too much devoted to their own
fierce and savage customs to endure with patience
either the restraints religion or those
 the social law thou hast never told me
daughter how contrary to all the usages either
 the burgh or the mountains this youth
came to reside in thy father's house 
all i know touching that matter said
catharine is that his father is a man consequence
among those hill men and that he desired
as a favour my father who hath had
wwivrsry 

dealings with them in the way his merchandise
to keep this youth for a certain time and
that two days since they parted as he was to
return home to his own mountains
and why has my daughter demanded the
priest maintained such a correspondence with
this highland youth that she should know how
to send for him when she desired to use his
services in my behalf surely this is much
influence for a maiden to possess over such
a wild colt as this youthful mountaineer
catharine blushed and answered with hesitation
 if i have had any influence with concha
heaven be my witness i have only exerted
it to enforce upon his fiery temper compliance
with the rules civil life it is true i have
long expected that you my father would be
obliged to take to flight and i therefore had
agreed with him that he should meet me at this
place as soon as he should receive a message
from me with a token which i yesterday dispatched
the messenger was a lightfooted
boy his own clan whom he used sometimes
to send on errands into the highlands
and am i then to understand daughter
that this youth so fair to the eye was nothing
more dear to you than as you desired to enlighten
his mind and reform his manners 
it is so my father and no otherwise answered
catharine and perhaps i did not do
well to hold intimacy with him even for his
instruction and improvement but my discourse
never led farther
then have i been mistaken my daughter 
for i thought i had seen in thee late some
change purpose and some wishful regards
looking back to this world which you were
at one time resolved to take leave
catharine hung down her head and blushed
more deeply than ever as she said yourself
father were used to remonstrate against
my taking the veil
nor do i now approve it my child said
the priest marriage is an honourable state
appointed by heaven as the regular means 
continuing the race man and i read not in the
scriptures what human inventions have since
affirmed concerning the superior excellence 
a state celibacy but i am jealous thee
my child as a father is his only daughter lest
thou shouldst throw thyself away upon someone
unworthy thee thy parent i know less
nice in thy behalf than i am countenances the
addresses that fierce and riotous reveller
whom they call henry the wynd he is
rich it may be but a haunter idle and debauched
company a common prizefighter
who has shed human blood like water can
such a one be a fit mate for catharine glover
 and yet report says they are soon to be
united
the fair maid perth's complexion changed
from red to pale and from pale to red as she
hastily replied i think not him though
it is true some courtesies have passed betwixt
us late both as he is my father's friend and
as being according to the custom the time
my valentine
your valentine my child said father
clement and can your modesty and prudence
have trifled so much with the delicacy 
your sex as to place yourself in such a relation
to such a man as this artificer think you
that this valentine a godly saint and christian
bishop as he is said to have been ever countenanced
a silly and unseemly custom more likely
to have originated in the heathen worship 
flora or venus when mortals gave the names
 deities to their passions and studied to excite
instead restraining them 
father said catharine in a tone more
displeasure than she had ever before assumed
to the carthusian i know not upon what
ground you tax me thus severely for complying
with a general practice authorized by universal
custom and sanctioned by my father's authority
i cannot feel it kind that you put such
misconstruction upon me
forgive me daughter answered the priest
mildly if i have given you offence but this
henry smith is a forward licentious man to
whom you cannot allow any uncommon degree
 intimacy and encouragement without exposing
yourself to worse misconstruction unless
indeed it be your purpose to wed him and
that very shortly
 say no more it my father said catharine
 you give me more pain than you would
desire to do and i may be provoked to answer
otherwise than as becomes me perhaps i have
already had cause enough to make me repent my
compliance with an idle custom at any rate
believe that henry smith is nothing to me and
that even the idle intercourse arising from st
valentine's day is utterly broken off
 i am rejoiced to hear it my daughter replied
the carthusian and must now prove
you on another subject which renders me most
anxious on your behalf you cannot yourself be
ignorant it although i could wish it were not
necessary to speak a thing so dangerous even
before these surrounding rocks cliffs and
stones but it must be said catharine you
have a lover in the highest rank scotland's
sons honour 
i know it father answered catharine
composedly i would it were not so
so would i also said the priest did i
see in my daughter only the child folly
which most young women are at her age especially
if possessed the fatal gift beauty
but as thy charms to speak the language an
idle world have attached to thee a lover such
high rank so i know that thy virtue and wisdom
will maintain the influence over the prince's
mind which thy beauty hath acquired
father replied catharine the prince is
a licentious gallant whose notice me tends
only to my disgrace and ruin can you who
seemed but now afraid that i acted imprudently
in entering into an ordinary exchange courtesies
with one my own rank speak with patience
 the sort correspondence which the
heir scotland dares to fix upon me know
that it is but two nights since he with a party
 his debauched followers would have carried
me by force from my father's house had i not
been rescued by that same rash spirited henry
smith who if he be too hasty in venturing on
danger on slight occasion is always ready to
venture his life in behalf innocence or in resistance
 oppression it is well my part to do
him that justice
 i should know something that matter
said the monk since it was my voice that sent
him to your assistance i had seen the party as
i passed your door and was hastening to the
civil power in order to raise assistance when i
perceived a man's figure coming slowly towards
me apprehensive it might he one the ambuscade
i stepped behind the buttresses the
chapel st john and seeing from a nearer
view that it was henry smith i guessed
which way he was bound and raised my voice
in an exhortation which made him double his
speed
i am beholden to you father said catharine
 but all this and the duke rothsay's
own language to me only show that the prince
is a profligate young man who will scruple no
extremities which may promise to gratify an idle
passion at whatever expense to its object his
emissary ramorny has even had the insolence
to tell me that my father shall suffer for it if i
dare to prefer being the wife an honest man
to becoming the loose paramour a married
prince so t see no other remedy than to take
the veil or run the risk my own ruin and
my poor father's were there no other reason
the terror these threats from a man so notoriously
capable keeping his word ought as
much to prevent my becoming the bride any
worthy man as it should prohibit me from unlatching
his door to admit murderers oh
good father what a lot is mine and how
fatal am i likely to prove to my affectionate parent
and to any one with whom i might ally
my unhappy fortunes 
be yet good cheer my daughter said
the monk there is comfort for thee even in
this extremity apparent distress ramorny is
a villain and abuses the ear his patron the
prince is unhappily a dissipated and idle youth 
but unless my grey hairs have been strangely
imposed on his character is beginning to alter
he hath been awakened to ramorny's baseness
and deeply regrets having followed his evil
advice i believe nay i am well convinced
that his passion for you has assumed a nobler
and purer character and that the lessons he has
heard from me on the corruptions the church
and the times will if enforced from your
lips sink deeply into his heart and perhaps
produce fruits for the world to wonder as
well as rejoice at old prophecies have said
that rome shall fall by the speech a woman

these are dreams father said catharine
 the visions one whose thoughts are
too much on better things to admit his thinking
justly upon the ordinary affairs earth
when we have looked long at the sun everything
else can only be seen indistinctly
thou art over hasty my daughter said
clement and thou shalt be convinced it
the prospects which i am to open to thee were
unfit to be exposed to one a less firm sense
 virtue or a more ambitious temper perhaps
it is not fit that even to you i should
display them but my confidence is strong in thy
wisdom and thy principles know then that
there is much chance that the church rome
will dissolve the union which she has herself
formed and release the duke rothsay from
his marriage with marjory douglas
here he paused
and if the church hath power and will todo
this replied the maiden what influence
can the divorce the duke from his wife produce
on the fortunes catharine glover 
she looked at the priest anxiously as she
spoke and he had some apparent difficulty in
framing his reply for he looked on the ground
while he answered her
what did beauty do for catharine logic 
unless our fathers told us falsely it raised her
to share the throne david bruce
did she live happy or die regretted good
father asked catharine in the same calm
and steady tone
she formed her alliance from temporal
and perhaps criminal ambition replied father
clement and she found her reward in vanity
and vexation spirit but had she wedded
with the purpose that the believing wife should
convert the unbelieving or confirm the doubting
husband what then had been her reward
love and honour upon earth and an
inheritance in heaven with queen margaret
and those heroines who have been the nursing
mothers the church
hitherto catharine had sat upon a stone beside
the priest's feet and looked up to him as
she spoke or listened but now as if animated
by calm yet settled feelings disapprobation
she rose up and extending her hand towards
the monk as she spoke addressed him with
a countenance and voice which might have become
a cherub pitying and even as much as
possible sparing the feelings the mortal
whose errors he is commissioned to rebuke
and is it even so she said and canso
much the wishes hopes and prejudices 
this vile world affect him who may be called
tomorrow to lay down his life for opposing the
corruptions a wicked age and backsliding
priesthood can it be the severely virtuous
father clement who advises his child to aim
at or even to think the possession a
throne and a bed which cannot become vacant
but by an act crying injustice to the present
possessor can it be the wise reformer the
s
church who wishes to rest a scheme in itself so
unjust upon a foundation so precarious since
when is it good father that the principal
libertine has altered his morals so much to be
likely to court in honourable fashion the daughter
 a perth artizan two days must have
wrought this change for only that space has
passed since he was breaking into my father's
house at midnight with worse mischief in his
mind than that a common robber and think
you that if rothsay's heart could dictate so
mean a match he could achieve such a purpose
without endangering both his succession and
his life assailed by the douglas and march at
the same time for what they must receive as
an act injury and insult to both their houses 
oh father clement where was your principle
where your prudence when they suffered you
to be bewildered by so strange a dream and
placed the meanest your disciples in the
right thus to reproach you 
the old man's eyes filled with tears as catharine
visibly and painfully affected by what
she had said was at length silent

by the mouths babes and sucklings
he said hath he rebuked those who would
seem wise in their generation i thank heaven
that hath taught me better thoughts than
my own vanity suggested through the medium
 so kind a monitress yes catharine i must
not hereafter wonder or exclaim when i see
those whom i have hitherto judged too harshly
struggling for temporal power and holding
all the while the language religious zeal i
thank thee daughter for thy salutary admonition
and i thank heaven that sent it by thy
lips rather than those a sterner reprover
catharine had raised her head to reply and
bid the old man whose humiliation gave her
pain be comforted when her eyes were arrested
by an object close at hand among the crags
and cliffs which surrounded this place seclusion
there were two which stood in such close
contiguity that they seemed to have been portions
 the same rock which rended by lightning
or by an earthquake now exhibited a
chasm about four feet in breadth betwixt

the masses stone into this chasm an oak
tree had thrust itself in one the fantastic
frolics which vegetation often exhibits in such
situations the tree stunted and illfed had
sent its roots along the face the rock in all
directions to seek for supplies and they lay
like military lines communication contorted
twisted and knotted like the immense
snakes the indian archipelago as catharine's
look fell upon the curious complication
 knotty branches and twisted roots she was
suddenly sensible that two large eyes were visible
among them fixed and glaring at her like
those a wild animal in ambush she started
and without speaking pointed out the object
to her companion and looking herself with
more strict attention could at length trace out
the bushy red hair and shaggy beard which
had hitherto been concealed by the drooping
branches and contorted roots the tree
when he saw himself discovered the highlander
for such he proved stepped forth from
his lurkingplace and stalking forward disvol
 e
m
played a colossal person clothed in a purple red
and greenchecked plaid under which he wore
a jacket bull's hide his bow and arrows were
at his back his head was bare and a large quantity
 tangled locks like the gibbs the irish
served to cover the head and supplied all the
purposes a bonnet his belt bore a sword
and dagger and he had in his hand a danish
poleaxe more recently called a lochaber axe
through the same rude portal advanced one
by one four men more similar size and
dressed and armed in the same manner
catharine was too much accustomed to the
appearance the inhabitants the mountains
so near to perth to permit herself to be alarmed
as another lowland maiden might have been
on the same occasion she saw with tolerable
composure these gigantic forms arrange themselves
in a semicircle around and in front the
monk and herself all bending upon them in
silence their large fixed eyes expressing as far
as she could judge a wild admiration her
beauty she inclined her head to them and uttered
imperfectly the usual words a highland
salutation the elder and leader the party
returned the greeting and then again remained
silent and motionless the monk told his beads 
and even catharine began to have strange fears
for her personal safety and anxiety to know whether
they were to consider themselves at personal
freedom she resolved to make the experiment
and moved forward as if to descend the
hill but when she attempted to pass the line 
highlanders they extended their poleaxes betwixt
each other so as effectually to occupy each
opening through which she could have passed
somewhat disconcerted yet not dismayed
for she could not conceive that any evil was intended
she sat down upon one the scattered
fragments rock and bade the monk standing
by her side be good courage
if i fear said father clement it is not
for myself for whether i be brained with the
axes these wild men like an ox when worn
out by labour he is condemned to the slaughter
or whether i am bound with their bowstrings
and delivered over to lliose who will take my
life with more cruel ceremony it can but little
concern me if they suffer thee dearest daughter
to escape uninjured
we have neither us replied the maiden
 perth any cause for apprehending evil 
and here comes conachar to assure us it
yet as she spoke she almost doubted her own
eyes so altered were the manner and attire 
the handsome stately and almost splendidly
dressed youth who springing like a roebuck
from a cliff considerable height lighted justin
front her his dress was the same tartan
worn by those who had first made their appearance
but closed at the throat and elbows with
a necklace and armlets gold the hauberk
which he wore over his person was steel
but so clearly burnished that it shone like silver
his arms were profusely ornamented and
his bonnet besides the eagle's feather marking
the quality chief was ornamented with a
chain gold wrapt several times around it
and secured by a large clasp adorned with
pearls his brooch by which the tartan mantle
or plaid as it is now called was secured on the
shoulder was also gold large and curiously
carved he bore no weapon in his hand excepting
a small sapling stick with a hooked
head his whole appearance and gait which
used formerly to denote a sullen feeling conscious
degradation was now bold forward and
haughty and he stood before catharine with
smiling confidence as if fully conscious his
improved appearance and waiting till she should
recognise him
conachar said catharine desirous to
break this state suspense are these your
father's men 
no fair catharine answered the young
man conachar is no more unless in regard
to the wrongs he has sustained and the vengeance
which they demand i am ian machin
maclan son to the chief the clan quhele
i have mounted my feathers as you see when i
changed my name and for these men they
are not my father's followers but mine you
see only one half them collected they forma
band consisting my foster father and eight
sons who are my bodyguard and the children
 my belt who breathe but to do my will
but conachar he added in a softer tone 
voice lives again so soon as catharine desires
to see him and while he is the young chief 
the clan quhele to all others he is to her as
humble and obedient as when he was simon
glover's apprentice see here is the stick i
had from you when we nutted together in the
sunny braes enoch when autumn was
young in the year that is gone i would not
part with it catharine for the truncheon my
tribe
while euclid thus spoke catharine began
to doubt in her own mind whether she had acted
prudently in requesting the assistance a bold
young man elated doubtless by his sudden
elevation from a state servitude to one which
she was aware gave him extensive authority
over a very lawless body adherents
 you do not fear me fair catharine said
the young chief taking her hand i suffered
my people to appear before me for a few minutes
that i miffht see how you could cnduie their
presence iiud methiiikti you regarded them as
if you were born to be a chieftain's wife
i have no reason to fear wrong from highlanders
said catharine firmly especially as
 thought conachar was with them conachar
has drunk our cup and eaten our bread 
and my father has often had traffic with highlanders
and never was there wrong or quarrel
betwixt him and them
no replied hector for such is the saxon
equivalent for eachin what never when
he took the part the gow chron the 
smith against eachin maclan 
say nothing to excuse it and believe it will
be your own fault if i ever again allude to it
but you had some command to lay upon me 
speak and you shall be obeyed
catharine hastened to reply for there was
something in the young chief's manner and
language which made her desire to shorten
the interview
eachin she said since conachar is no
hunger your name you ought to be sensible
that in claiming as i honestly might a service
from my equal i little thought that was addressing
a person such superior power and
consequence you as well as i have been obliged
to the religious instruction this goodman
he is now in great danger wicked men
have accused him with false charges and he is
desirous to remain in safety and concealment
till the storm shall pass away
aha the good clerk clement ay the
worthy clerk did much for me and more than
my rugged temper was capable to profit by i
will be glad to see any one in the town 
perth persecute one who hath taken hold 
maclan's mantle 
it may not be safe to trust too much to
that said catharine i nothing doubt the
power your tribe but when the black douglas
takes up a feud he is not to be scared by
the shaking a highland plaid
the highlander disguised his displeasure at
this speech with a forced laugh
the sparrow he said that is next the
eye seems larger than the eagle that is perched
on bcngoilc you fear the douglasseses most because
they sit next to you but be it as you
will you will not believe how wide our hills
and vales and forests extend beyond the dusky
barrier yonder mountains and you think
all the world lies on the banks the tay
but this good clerk shall see hills that could
hide him were all the douglasseses on his quest 
ay and he shall see men enough also to make
them glad to get once more southward the
grampian and wherefore should you not
go with the good man i will send a party to
bring him in safety from perth and we will setup
the old trade beyond loch tay only no more
cutting out gloves for me i will find your
father in hides but i will not cut them save
when they are on the createes backs
my father will come one day and see your
housekeeping conachar i mean hector 
but times must be quieter for there is feud between
the town'speople and the followers 
the noblemen and there is speech war about
to break out in the highlands
yes by our lady catharine and were it
not for that same higlihmd war you should
not thus put off your highland visit my pretty
mistress but the race the hills are no
longer to be divided into two nations they
will fight like men for the supremacy and he
who gets it will deal with the king scotland
as an equal not as a superior pray that the
victory may fall to maclan my pious st catharine
for thou shalt pray for one who loves thee
dearly
i will pray for the right said catharine 
 or rather i will pray that there be peace on
all sides farewell kind and excellent father
clement believe i shall never forget thy lessons
 remember me in thy prayers but how
wilt thou be able to sustain a journey so toilsome

they shall carry him if need be said
hector if we go far without finding a horse
for him but you catharine it is far from
hence to perth let me attend you thither as
i was wont
if you were as you were wont i would
not refuse your escort but gold brooches
and bracelets are perilous company when the
lauderdale and annandale lancers are riding
as throng upon the highway as the leaves at
hollowness and there is no safe meeting betwixt
highland tartans and steel jackets
she hazarded this remark as she somewhat
suspected that in casting his slough young
eachin had not entirely surmounted the habits
which he had acquired in his humbler state and
that though he might use bold words he would
not be rash enough to brave the odds numbers
to which a descent into the vicinity 
the city would be likely to expose him it appeared
that she judged correctly for after a
farewell in which she compounded for the immunity
 her lips by permitting him to kiss
her hand she returned towards perth and
could obtain at times when she looked back an
occasional glance the highlanders as winding
through the most concealed and impracticable
paths they bent their way towards the
north
she felt in paint relieved from her immediate
anxiety bb the distance increased betwixt her
and these men whose actions were only directed
by the will their chief and whose chief
was a giddy and impetuous boy she apprehended
no insult on her return to perth from
the soldiery any party whom she might meet 
for the rules chivalry were in those days a
surer protection to a maiden decent appearance
than an escort armed men whose cognizance
might not be acknowledged as friendly
by any other party whom they might chance
to encounter but more remote dangers pressed
on her apprehension the pursuit the
licentious prince was rendered formidable by
threats which his unprincipled counsellor ramorn
had not shunned to utter against her
father if she persevered in her coyness these
menaces in such an age and from such a character
were deep grounds for alarm nor could
she consider the pretensions to her favour which
conachar had scarce repressed during his state
 servitude and seemed now to avow boldly
as less fraught with evil since there had been repeated
incursions the highlanders into the
very town perth and citizens had on more
occasions than one been made prisoners and
carried off from their own houses or had fallen
by the claymore in the very streets their city
she feared too her father's importunity on
behalf the smith whose conduct on st
valentine's day unworthy reports had reached
her and whose suit had he stood clear in
her good opinion she dared not listen to while
ramorny's threats revenge upon her father
rung on her ear she thought on these various
dangers with the deepest apprehension and an
earnest desire to escape from them and herself
by taking refuge in the cloister but saw no
possibility obtaining her father's consent to
the only course from which she expected peace
and protection
in the course these reflections we cannot
discover that she very distinctly regretted
that her perils attended her because she was
the fair maid pei'ih this was one point
which marked that she was not yet altogether
an angel and perhaps it was another that
in despite henry smith's real or supposed
delinquencies a sigh escaped from her bosom
when she thought upon st valentine's
dawn
chapter iii
we have shown the secrets the confessional
 those the sick chamber are not hidden
from us in a darkened apartment where
salves and medicines showed that the leech had
been busy in his craft a tall thin form lay on a
bed arrayed in a nightgown belted around him
with pain on his brow and a thousand stormypassions
agitating his bosom everything in
the apartment indicated a man opulence and
 expense henbane d wining the apothecary
who seemed to have the care the patient
stole with a crafty and catlike step from
one corner the room to another busying
himself with mixing medicines and preparing
dressings the sick man groined once or twice
on which the leech advancing to his bedside
asked whether these sounds were a token 
the pain his body or the distress his
mind
 both thou poisoning varlet said sir
john ramorny and being encumbered
with thy accursed company
if that is all i can relieve your knighthood
 one these ills by presently removing
myself elsewhere thanks to the feuds this
boisterous time had i twenty hands instead 
these two poor servants my art displaying
his skinny palms there is enough employment
for them well requited employment too
where thanks and crowns contend which shall
best pay my services while you sir john
wreak upon your chirurgeon the anger you ought
only to bear against the author your wound
 villain it is beneath me to reply to thee
said the patient but every word thy malignant
tongue is a dirk inflicting wounds which
set all the medicines arabia at defiance
sir john i understand you not but if you
give way to these tempestuous fits rage it is
impossible but fever and inflammation must bethe
result
why then dost thou speak in a sense to
chafe my blood why dost thou name the supposition
 thy worthless self having more
hands than nature gave thee while i a knight
and gentleman am mutilated like a cripple 
sir john replied the chirurgeon i am
no divine nor a mainly obstinate believer in
some things which divines tell us yet i may
remind you that you have been kindly dealt
with for if the blow which has done you this
injury had lighted on your neck as it was
aimed it would have swept your head from
your shoulders instead amputating a less considerable
member
i wish it had d wining i wish it had
lighted as it was addressed i should not then
have seen a policy which had spun a web so
fine as mine burst through by the brute force 
a drunken churl i should not have been reserved
to see horses which i must not mount 
lists which i must no longer enter splendours
vol y
which i cannot hope to share or battles which
i must not take part in i should not with a
manes passions for power and for strife be set to
keep place among the women despised by them
too as a miserable impotent cripple unable to
aim at obtaining the favour the sex
supposing all this to be so i will yet pray
 your knighthood to remark replied dining
still busying himself with arranging the
dressings the wounds that your eyes which
you must have lost with your head may being
spared to you present as rich a prospect 
pleasure as either ambition or victory in the
lists or in the field or the love woman itself
could have proposed to you
my sense is too dull to catch thy meaning
koch replied ramorny what is this precious
spectacle reserved to me in such a shipwreck 
the dearest that mankind knows replied
dwining and then in the accent a lover who
utters the name his beloved mistress and
expresses his passion for her in the very tone 
his voice he added the word revenge 
the patient had raised himself on his couch
to listen with some anxiety for the solution 
the physician's enigma he laid himself down
again as he heard it explained and after a short
pause asked in what christian college learned
you this morality good master d wining 
in no christian college answered his
physician for though it is privately received
in most it is openly and manfully adopted in
none but i have studied among the sages 
granada where the fierysouled moor lifts high
his deadly dagger as it drops with his enemy's
blood and avows the doctrine which the pallid
christian practises though cowardlike he dare
not name it
thou art then a more highsouled villain
than i deemed thee said ramorny
let that pass answered d wining the
waters that are the stillest are also the deepest 
and the foe is most to be dreaded who never
threatens till he strikes you knights and menatarms
go straight to your purpose with sword
in hand we who are clerks win our access
with a noiseless step and an indirect approach
but attain our object not less surely
and i said the knight who have trod
to my revenge with a mailed foot which made
all echo around it must now use such a slipper
as thine ha v
he who lacks strengths said the wily medicine
 must attain his purpose by skill
and tell me sincerely medicine wherefore
thou wouldst read me these devils lessons
why wouldst thou thrust me faster or further
on to my vengeance than i may seem to thee
ready to go my own accord i am old in the
ways the world man and i know that such
as thou do not drop words in vain or thrust
themselves upon the dangerous confidence 
men like me sae with the prospect advancing
some purpose their own what interest
hast thouin the roach whether peaceful or bloody
which i may pursue on these occurrence 
in plain dealing sir knight though it is
 what i seldom use answered the leech my
road to revenge is the same with yours
with mine man said ramorny with a
tone scornful surprise i thought it had
been high beyond thy reach thou aim at the
same revenge with ramorny 
 ay truly replied divining for the
smithy churl under whose blow you have suffered
has often done me despite and injury
he has thwarted me in council and despised
me in action his brutal and unhesitating
bluntness is a living reproach to the subtlety 
my natural disposition i fear him and i hate
him
 and you hope to find an active coadjutor
in me said ramorny in the same supercilious
tone as before but know the artizan fellow
is too low in degree to be to me either
the object hatred or fear yet he shall not
escape we hate not the reptile that has stung
us though we might shake it off the wound
and tread upon it i know the ruffian old asa
stout manatarmsj and a pretender as i have
heard to the favour the scornful puppet
whose beauties forsooth spurred us to our wise
and hopeful attempt fiends that direct this
nether world by what malice have you decided
that the hand which has couched a lance against
the bosom a prince should be struck off like
a saphne by the blow a churl and during
the turmoil a midnight riot well medicine
thus far our courses hold together and i
bid thee well believe that i will crush for thee
this reptile mechanic but do not thou think
to escape me when that part my revenge is
done which will be most easily and speedily accomplished

not it may be altogether so easily accomplished
said the apothecary for if your
knighthood will credit me there will be found
small ease or security in dealing with him he is
the strongest boldest and most skilful swordsman
in perth and all the country around it
fear nothing he shall be met with had he
the strength sampson but then mark me 
hope not thou to escape my vengeance unless
thou become my passive agent in the scene
which is to follow mark me i say once more
i have studied at no moorish college and lack
some thy unbounded appetite for revenge
but yet i will have my share vengeance 
listen to me medicine while i shall thus far
unfold myself but beware treachery for
powerful as ihy fiend is thou hast taken lessons
from a meaner devil than mine hearken
the master whom i have served through vice
and virtue with too much zeal for my own
character perhaps but with unshaken fidelity
to him the very man to soothe whose frantic
folly i have incurred this irreparable loss is
at the prayer his doating father about to
sacrifice me by turning me out his favour
and leaving me at the mercy the hypocritical
relative with whom he seeks a precarious reconciliation
at my expense if he perseveres in
this most ungrateful purpose thy fiercest moors
were their complexion swarthy as the smoke 
hell shall blush to see their revenge outdone 
but i will give him one more chance for honour
and safety before my wrath shall descend on
him in unrelenting and unmitigated fury 
there then thus far thou hast my confidence 
close hands on our bargain close hands did
i say where is the hand that should be the
pledge and representative ramorny's plighted
word is it nailed on the public pillory or
flung as offal to the houseless dogs who arc
even now snarling over it lay thy finger on
s
the mutilated stump then and swear to be a
faithful actor in my revenge as i shall be iii
yours how now sir leech look you pale 
you who say to death stand back or advance
can you tremble to think him or to hear him
named i have not mentioned your fee for one
who loves revenge for itself requires no deeper
bribe yet if broad lands and large sums 
gold can increase thy zeal in a brave cause
believe me these shall not be lacking
they tell for something in my humble
wishes said dwining the poor man in this
bustling world is thrust down like a dwarf in a
crowd and so trodden under foot the rich and
powerful rise like giants above the press and
are at ease while all is turmoil around them
then shalt thou arise above the press medicine
as high as gold can raise thee this
purse is weighty yet it is but an earnest 
thy guerdon
and this smith my noble benefactor 
said tle leech as he pouched the gratuity 
 this henry the wynd or whatever is his
name would not the news that he hath paid
the penalty his action assuage the pain 
thy knighthood's wound better than the barra
 mecca with which i have salved it 
he is beneath the thoughts ramorny 
and i have no more resentment against him
than i have illwill at the senseless weapon which
he swayed but it is just thy hate should be
vented upon him where is he chiefly to be met
with
that also i have considered said dining
 to make the attempt by day in his
own house were too open and dangerous for
he hath five servants who work with him at
the stithy four them strong knaves and all
loving to their master by night were scarce less
desperate for he hath his doors strongly fastened
with bolt oak and bar iron and ere
the fastenings his house could be forced the
neighbourhood would rise to his rescue especially
as they are still alarmed by the practice
on st valentine's even
o ay true medicine said ramorny
for deceit is thy nature even with me thou
knowest my hand and signet as thou saddest
when my hand was found cast out on the street
like the disgusting refuse a shambles wliy
having such knowledge dentist thou with these
jolterheaded citizens to consult that patrick
charteris whose spurs should be hacked off
from his heels for the communion which he
holds with paltry burghers and whom thou
brought st here with the fools to do dishonour
to the lifeless hand which had it held its
wonted place he was not worthy to have touched
in peace or faced in war 
my noble patron as soon as i had reason
to know you had been the sufferer i urged them
with all my powers persuasion to desist from
prosecuting the feud but the swaggering smith
and one or two other hot heads cried out for
vengeance your knighthood must know this
fellow calls himself bachelor to the fair maiden
 perth and stands upon his honour to follow
up her father's quarrel but i have forestalled
his market in that quarter and that is something
in earnest revenge
how mean you by that sir leech said
the patient
your knighthood shall conceive said the
modicinor that this smith doth not live
m
within compass but is an outlier and a galliard
i met him myself on st valentine's
day shortly after the affray between the townsfolk
and the followers douglas yes i met
him sneaking through the lanes and bypassages
with a common minstrel wench with her
messan and her viol on his one arm and her
buxom self hanging upon the other what thinks
your honour is not this a trim squire to cross
a prince's love with the fairest girl in perth
strike off the hand a knight and baron and
become gentlemanusher to a strolling gleewoman
all in the course the same fourandtwenty
hours 
marry i think the better him that he
is so much a gentleman's humour clown
though he be said ramorny i would he
had been a precisian instead a galliard and
i should have had better heart to aid thy revenge
 and such revenge revenge on a smith
in the quarrel a pitiful manufacturer rotten
cheveron and yet it shall be taken in full
thou hast commenced it i warrant me by
thine own manoeuvres
in a small degree only said the apothecary
 i took care that two or three the
most notorious gossips in curfew street who
liked not to hear catharine called the fair
maid perth should be possessed this story
 her faithful valentine they opened on the
scent so keenly that rather than doubt had
fallen on the tale they would have vouched for
it as if their own eyes had seen it the lover
came to her father's within an hour after and
your worship may think what a reception he had
from the angry glover for the damsel herself
would not be looked upon and thus your honour
sees i had a foretaste revenge but i
trust to receive the full draught from the hands
 your lordship with whom i am in a brotherly
league which 
brotherly said the knight contemptuously
 but be it so the priests say we are all
 one common earth i cannot tell there
seems to me some difference but the better
mould shall keep faith with the baser and
thou shalt have thy revenge call thou my
page hither
a young man made his appearance from
the anteroom upon the physician's summons
 eviot said the knight does southron
wait and is he sober
he is as sober as sleep can make him after
a deep drink answered the page
 then fetch him hither and do thou shut
the door
a heavy step presently approached the apartment
and a man entered whose deficiency 
height seemed made up in breadth shoulders
and strength arm
there is a man thou must deal upon bonthrone
said the knight
the man smoothed his rugged features and
grinned a smile satisfaction
that medicine will show thee the party
take such advantage time place and circumstance
as will ensure the result and mind
you come not by the worst for the man is the
fighting smith the wynd
it will be a tough job growled the assassin
 for if i miss my blow i may esteem
myself but a dead man all perth rings with
the smith's skill and strength
take two assistants with thee said the
knight
not i said bonthron if you double
anything let it be the reward
account it doubled said his master but
see thy work be thoroughly executed
trust me for that sir knight seldom
have i failed
use this sage man's directions said the
wounded man pointing to the physician and
hark thee await his coming forth and drink
not till the business be done
i will not answered the dark satellite my
own life depends on my blow being steady and
sure i know whom i have to deal with
vanish then till he summons you and
have axe and dagger in readiness
bonthron nodded and withdrew
 will your knighthood venture to intrust
such an act to a single hand said the medicine
when the assassin had left the room may
i pray you to remember that yonder party did
two nights since baffle six armed men 
question me not sir mcdicincr a manlike
bonthron who knows time and place is
worth a score confused revellers call eviot
thou shalt first exert thy powers healing
and do not doubt that thou shalt in the farther
work be aided by one who will match thee in
the art sudden and unexpected destruction
the page eviot again appeared at the medicine's
summons and at his master's sign assisted
the chirurgeon in removing the dressings
from sir john ramorny's wounded arm
dwining viewed the naked stump with a species
 professional satisfaction enhanced no
doubt by the malignant pleasure which his evil
disposition took in the pain and distress his
fellowcreatures the knight just turned his
eye on the ghastly spectacle and uttered under
the pressure bodily pain or mental agony a
groan which he would fain have repressed
you groan sir said the leech in his soft
insinuating tone voice but with a sneer 
enjoyment mixed with scorn curling upon his
lip which his habitual dissimulation could not
altogether disguise you groan but be comforted
this henry smith knows his business
it
 bis sword is as true to its aim as his hammer
to the anvil had a common swordsman struck
this fatal blow be bad harmed the bone and
damaged the muscles so that even my art might
not have been able to repair them but henry
smith's cut is clean and as sure as that with
which my own scalpel could have made the
amputation in a few days you will be able
with care and attention to the ordinances medicine
to stir abroad
but my hand the loss my hand 
it may be kept secret for a time said
the medicine i have possessed two or three
tattling fools in deep confidence that the baud
which was found was that your knighthood's
groom black quentin and your knighthood
knows that he is parted for fife in such sort
as to make it generally believed
 i know well enough said ramorny that
the rumour may stifle the truth for a short time
but what avails this brief delay 
it may be concealed till your knighthood
retires for a time from the court and then when
new accidents have darkened the recollection
f the pr
iiy we have much that is superfluous about us
man can see with one eye hear with one ear
touch with one hand smell with one nostril 
and why we should have two each unless
to supply an accidental loss or injury i for
one am at a loss to conceive
sir john ramorny turned from the prince
with a low groan
 nay sir john said the duke i am
quite serious you know the truth touching the
legend steelhand carnegie better than i
since he was your own neighbour in his time
that curious engine could only be made in rome 
but i will wager an hundred marks with you
that let the perth armourer have the use it
for a pattern henry the wynd will execute
as complete an imitation as all the smiths in
rome could accomplish with all the cardinals
to bid a blessing on the work
i could venture to accept your wager my
lord answered ramorny bitterly but there
is no time for foolery you have dismissed me
from your service at command your uncle 
at command my father answered the
prince
 
 upon whom your uncle's commands arc
imperative replied ramorny i am a disgraced
man thrown aside as i may now flints
away my right hand glove as a thing useless
yet my head might help you though my hail
he gone is your grace disposed to listen tome
for one word serious import for i am
much exhausted and feel my force sinking under
me
speak your pleasure said the prince 
 thy loss binds me to hear thee thy bloody
stump is a sceptre to control me speak then
but be merciful in thy strength privilege
i will be brief for mine own sake as well
as thine indeed i have but little to say douglas
places himself immediately at the head his
vassals he will assemble in the name king
robert thirty thousand borderers whom he
will shortly after lead into the interior to demand
that the duke roth say receive or either
restore his daughter to the rank and privileges
 his duchess king robert will yield
to any conditions which may secure peace 
what will the duke do
 the duke rothsay loves peace said
the prince haughtily but he never feared
war ere he takes back yonder proud peat to
his table and his bed at the command her
father douglas must be king scotland
 be it so but even this is the less pressing
peril especially as it threatens open violence
for the douglas works not in secret
 what is there which presses and keeps us
awake at this late hour i am a weary man
thou a wounded one and the very tapers are
blinking as if tired our conference
tell me then who is it that rules this
kingdom scotland said ramorny
robert third the name said the prince
raising his bonnet as he spoke and long
may he sway the sceptre 
true and amen answered ramorny 
but who sways king robert and dictates
almost every measure which the good king
pursues
my lord albany you would say replied
the prince yes it is true my father
is guided almost entirely bv tir counsels lii

brother uor can we blame him in our consciences
sir john ramorny for little help hath
he had from his son
let us help him now my lord said ramorn
 i am possessor a dreadful secret
albany hath been trafficking with me to join
him in taking your grace's life he offers full
pardon for the past high favour for the future
how man my life i trust though thou
dost only mean my kingdom it were impious 
he is my father's brother they sat on the knees
 the same father lay in the bosom the
same mother out on thee man what follies
they make thy sickbed believe 
believe indeed said ramorny it is
new to me to be termed credulous but the
man through whom albany communicated his
temptations is one whom all will believe so
soon as he hints at mischief even the medicaments
which are prepared by his hands have a
relish poison
tush such a slave would slander a saint
replied the prince thou art duped for once
ramon shrewd as thou art mv uncle albany
is ambitious aud would secure for himself
and for his house a larger portion power and
wealth than he ought in reason to desire but
to suppose he would dethrone or slay his brother's
son fie ramorny put me not to quote
the old saw that evil doers are evil readers 
it is your suspicion not your knowledge which
speaks
your grace is fatally deluded i will put
it to an issue the duke albany is generally
hated for his greed and covetousness your
highness is it may be more beloved than 
ramorny stopped the prince calmly filled
ap the blank more beloved than i am honoured
it is so i would have it ramorny
at least said ramorny you are more
beloved than you are feared and that is no safe
condition for a prince but give me your honour
and knightly word that you will not resent
what good service i shall do in your behalf
and lend me your signet to engage friends
in your name and the duke albany shall
not assume authority in this court till the
wasted band which ojicc terminated this stump
shall be again united lo the body aud acting in
obedience to the dictates my mind
you would not venture to dip your hands
in royal blood said the prince sternly
fie my lord at no rate blood need not
be shed life may nay will be extinguished 
itself for want trimming it with fresh oil
or screening it from a breath wind the quivering
light will die in the socket to suffer a
man to die is not to kill him
true i had forgot that policy well then
suppose my uncle albany does not continue to
live i think that must be the phrase who
then rules the court scotland 
robert the third with consent advice
and authority the most mighty robert duke
 rothsay lieutenant the kingdom and aller
ego in whose favour indeed the good
king wearied with the fatigues and troubles 
sovereignty will i guess be well disposed to
abdicate so long live our brave young monarch
king robert the fourth 
 ille viaiu fortis
angles ludehit in hostis 
and our father and predecessor said
rothsay will he continue to live to pray for
us as our beadsman by whose favour he holds
the privilege laying his grey hairs in the grave
as soon and no earlier than the course nature
permits or must he also encounter some
 those negligence in consequence which
men cease to continue to live and exchange the
limits a prison or a convent resembling
one for the dark and tranquil cell where the
priests say that the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest 
you speak in jest my lord replied ramorn
 to harm the good old king were
equally unnatural and impolitic
 why shrink from that man when thy whole
scheme answered the prince in stern displeasure
 is one lesson unnatural guilt mixed
with shortsighted ambition if the king 
scotland can scarcely make head against his
nobles even now when he can hold up before
them an unsullied and honourable banner who
would follow a prince that is blackened with the
death an uncle and the imprisonment a

father why man tby policy were enough to
revolt a heathen divan to say nought the council
 a christian nation thou wert my tutor
ramorny and perhaps i might justly upbraid
thy lessons and example for some the follies
which men chide in me perhaps if it had
not been for thee i had not been standing at
midnight in this fool's guise looking at his
dress to hear an ambitious profligate propose
to me the murder an imcle the dethroning
 the best fathers since it is my fault as
well as thine that has sunk me so deep in the
gulf infamy it were unjust that thou alone
shouldst die for it but dare not to renew this
theme to me on peril thy life i will proclaim
thee to my father to albany to scotland
 throughout its length and breadth as
many market crosses as are in the land shall
have morsels the traitor's carcass who dare
counsel such horrors to the heir scotland 
well hope i indeed that the fever thy wound
and the intoxicating influence the cordials
which act on thy infirm brain have this night operated
on thee rather than any fixed purpose
 suotb my lord said ramon it i
have said anything which could so greatly exasperate
your highness it must have been by
excess zeal mingled with imbecility understanding
surely i all men am least
likely to propose ambitious projects with a prospect
 advantage to myself alas my only
future views must be to exchange lance and
saddle for the breviary and the confessional
the convent minores must receive the maimed
and impoverished knight ramorny who
will there have ample leisure to meditate upon
the text put not thy faith in princes 
it is a goodly purpose said the prince 
and we will not be lacking to promote it
our separation i thought would have been but
for a time it must now be perpetual certainly
after such talk as we have held it were
sleet that we should live asunder but the
convent minores or whatever other house receives
thee shall be richly endowed and highly
favoured by us and now sir john ramorn
sleep sleep and forget this 
conversation in which the fever disease
and wine lias rather i trust held colloquy
than your own proper thoughts light to the
door eviot
a call from eviot summoned the attendants
 the prince who had been sleeping on the
staircase and hall exhausted by the revels 
the evening
js there none amongst you sober said
the duke rothsay disgusted by the appearance
 his attendants
not a man not a man answered the followers
with a drunken shout we are none 
us traitors to the emperor merrymakers
and are all you turned into brutes
then said the prince
 in obedience and imitation your grace
answered one fellow or if we are a little
behind you one pull at the pitcher will 
 peace beast said the duke rothsay
are there none you sober i say 
yes my noble liege was the answer 
here is one false brother watkins the englishman

come liithor then watkins and aid mc

with a torch give me a cloak too and another
bonnet and take away this trumpery throwing
down his coronet feathers i would i
could throw off all my follies as easily english
wat attend me alone and the rest you
 your revelry and doff your mumming habits
the holytide is expended and the fast
has begun
our monarch has abdicated sooner than
usual this night said one the revel rout 
but as the prince gave no encouragement such
as happened for the time to want the virtue 
sobriety endeavoured to assume it as well as
they could and the whole the late rioters began
to adopt the appearance a set decent
persons who having been surprised into intoxication
endeavour to disguise their condition
by assuming a double portion formality 
behaviour in the interim the prince having
made a hasty reform in his dress was lighted
to the door by the only sober man the company
but in his progress thither had wellnigh
stumbled over the sleeping bulk the brute
bonthrou
 how now is that vile beast in our way
once more he said in anger and disgust
here some you toss this caitiff into the
horsetrough that for once in his life he maybe
washed clean
while the train executed his commands availing
themselves a fountain which was in the
outer court and while bonthron underwent a
discipline which he was incapable resisting
otherwise than by some inarticulate groans and
snorts like those a dying boar the prince
proceeded on his way to his apartments in a
mansion called the constable's lodgings from
the house being the property the earls errol
on the way to divert his thoughts from
more un pleasing matters the prince asked his
companion how he came to be sober when the
rest the party had been so much overcome
with liquor
so please your honour's grace replied
english wat i confess it was very familiar in
me to be sober when it was your grace's pleasure
that your train should be mad drunk butin
respect they were all scotchmen but myself
i thought it argued no policy iu getting
drunken in their company seeing that they
only endure me even when we are all sober
and if the wine were uppermost i might tell
them a piece my mind and be paid with as
many stabs as there are scenes in the good company

so it is your purpose never to join any 
the revels our household 
under favour yes unless it be your grace's
pleasure that the residue your train should
remain one day sober to admit will watkins
to get drunk without terror his life
such occasion may arrives where dost
thou serve watkins 
in the stable so please you
let our chamberlain bring thee into the
household as a yeoman the nightwatch i
like thy favour and it is something to have one
sober fellow in the house although he is only
such through the fear death attend therefore
near our person and thou shalt find sobriety
a thriving virtue
meantime a load care and fear added to
the distress sir john ramornys sickchamber
his reflections disordered as they were
by the opiate fell into great confusion when
the prince in whose presence he had suppressed
its effect by strong resistance had left the
apartment his consciousness which he had
possessed perfectly during the interview began
to be very much disturbed he felt a general
sense that he had incurred a great danger
that he had rendered the prince his enemy
and that he had betrayed to him a secret which
might affect his own life in this state mind
and body it was not strange that he should
either dream or else that his diseased organs
should become subject to that species phantasmagoria
which is excited by the use opium
he thought that the shade queen arabella
stood by his bedside and demanded the
youth whoih she had placed under his charge
simple virtuous gay and innocent
thou hast rendered him reckless dissolute
and vicious said the shade pallid majesty
yet i thank thee john ramorny ungrateful
to me false to thy word and treacherous to
u
my hopes thy hate shall counteract the evil
which thy friendship has done to him and
well do i hope that now thou art no longer his
counsellor a bitter penance on earth may purchase
my illfated child pardon and acceptance
in a better world
ramorny stretched out his arms after his benefactress
and endeavoured to express contrition
and excuse but the countenance the
apparition became darker and sterner till it was
no longer that the late queen but presented
the gloomy and haughty countenance the
black douglas then the timid and sorrowful
face king robert who seemed to mourn over
the approaching dissolution his royal house 
and then a group fantastic features partly
hideous partly ludicrous which moped and
chattered and twisted themselves into unnatural
and extravagant forms as if ridiculing his
endeavour to obtain an exact idea their lineaments

chapter vl
the morning ash wednesday arose pale
and bleak as usual at this season in scotland
where the worst and most inclement weather
often occurs in the early spring months it
was a severe day frost and the citizens hai
to sleep away the consequences the preceding
holiday's debauchery the sun had therefore
risen for an hour above the horizon before there
was any general appearance life among the
inhabitants perth so that it was some time
after daybreak when an early citizen going to
mass saw the body the luckless oliver proudfate
lying on his face across the kennel in the
manner in which he had fallen under the blow
as our readers will easily imagine antony
vol ir m
bonthron the boy the belt that is the executioner
 the pleasure john ramorny
this early citizen was allan griffin so termed
because he was master the griffin inn 
and the alarm which he raised soon brought together
first straggling neighbours and by and
by a concourse citizens at first from the
circumstance the wellknown buffcoat and
the crimson feather in the headpiece the noise
arose that it was the stout smith that lay there
slain this false rumour continued for sometime
 for the host the griffin who himself
had been a magistrate would not permit the
body to be touched or stirred till bailie craigdallied
arrived so that the face was not seen
 this concerns the fair city my friends
he said and if it is the stout smith the
wynd who lies here the man lives not in perth
who will not risk land and life to avenge him
look you the villains have struck him down
behind his back for there is not a man within
ten scotch miles perth gentle or semple
highland or lowland that would have met him
face to face with such evil purpose oh brave
men perth the flower your manhood has
been cut down and that by a base and treacherous
hand 
a wild cry fury arose from the people who
were fast assembling
we will take him on our shoulders said
a strong butcher we will carry him to the
king's presence at the dominican convent
 ay ay answered a blacksmith neither
bolt nor bar shall keep us from the king neither
monk nor mass shall break our purpose a better
armourer never laid hammer on anvil 
 to the dominicans to the dominicans 
shouted the assembled people
bethink you burghers said another citizen
 our king is a good king and loves us
like his children it is the douglas and the duke
 albany that will not let good king robert
hear the distresses his people
are we to be slain in our own streets for
the king's softness heart said the butcher
the bruce did otherwise if the king will
not keep us we will keep ourselves ring the
bells backward every bell them that is
made metal cry and spare not st johnston's
hunt is up 
ay cried another citizen and let us to
the holds albany and the douglas and burn
them to the ground let the fires tell far and
near that perth knew how to avenge her stout
henry gow he has fought a score times
for the fair city's right let us show we can
fight once to avenge his wrong hallo ho 
brave citizens st johnstoun's hunt is up 
this cry the wellknown rallying word
amongst the inhabitants perth and seldom
heard but on occasions general uproar was
echoed from voice to voice and one or two
neighbouring steeples which the enraged citizens
possessed themselves either by consent 
the priests or in spite their opposition began
to ring out the ominous alarm notes in which
as the ordinary succession the chimes were
reversed the bells were said to be rung backward

still as the crowd thickened and the roar
waxed more universal and louder allan griftmi
a burly man with a deep voice and well respected
among high and low kept this station
as he bestrode the corpse and called loudly to
the multitude to keep back and wait the arrival
 the magistrates
we must proceed by order in this matter
my masters we must have our magistrates atour
head they are duly chosen and elected
in our townhall good men and true every one 
we will not be called rioters or idle perturbations
 the king's peace stand you still and
make room for yonder comes bailie craigdal
lie ay and honest simon glover to whom the
fair city is so much bounden alas alas my
kind townsmen his beautiful daughter was a
bride yesternight this morning the fair maid
 perth is a widow before she has been a
wife
this new theme sympathy increased the
rage and sorrow the crowd the more as many
women now mingled with them who echoed
back the alarm cry to the men
ay ay st johnstoun's hunt is up for
the fair maid perth and the brave henry
gow up up every one you spare not for
your skincutting to the stables to the stables
 when the horse is gone the manatarms
is useless cut off the grooms and yeomen
lame maim and stab the horses kill the base
squires and pages let these proud knights
meet us on their feet if they dare 
they dare not they dare not answered
the men their strength is in their horses and
armour and yet the haughty and ungrateful
villains have slain a man whose skill as an armourer
was never matched in indian or venice
to arms to arms brave burghers st johnston's
hunt is up 
amid this clamour the magistrates and superior
class inhabitants with difficulty obtained
room to examine the body having with
them the townclerk to take an official protocol
or as it is still called a precognition the
condition in which it was found to these delays
the multitude submitted with a patience
and order which strongly marked the national
character a people whose resentment has always
been the more deeply dangerous that they
will without relaxing their determination 
vengeance submit with patience to all delays
which are necessary to ensure its attainment
the multitude therefore received their magistrates
with a loud cry in which the thirst 
revenge was announced together with the deferential
welcome to the patrons by whose direction
they expected to obtain it in right and
legal fashion
while these accents welcome still rung
above the crowd who now filled the whole adjacent
streets receiving and circulating a thousand
varying reports the fathers the city
caused the body to be raised and more closely
examined when it was instantly perceived and
the truth publicly announced that not the armourer
 the wynd so highly and according
to the esteemed qualities the time so justly
popular among his fellow citizens but a man
 far less general estimation though not without
his own value in society lay murdered before
them the brisk bonnetmaker oliver
proudfute the resentment the people had
so much turned upon the general opinion that
their frank and brave champion henry gow
was the slaughtered person that the contradiction
 the report served to cool the general
fury although if poor oliver had been recognised
at first there is little doubt that the cry
 vengeance would have been as unanimous as
in the case henry wynd the first circulation
 the unexpected intelligence even excited
a smile among the crowd so near are the
confines the ludicrous to those the terrible
the murderers have without doubt taken
him for henry smith said griffin which
must have been a great comfort to him in the
circumstances
but the arrival other persons on the scene
soon restored its deeply tragic character
j
chapter v ir
who that light rings the b diablo ho 
the town will rise
othello
the wild rumours which flew through the
town speedily followed by the tolling the
alarm bells spread general consternation the
nobles and knights with their followers gathered
in different places rendezvous where a
defence could best be maintained and the alarm
reached the royal residence where the young
prince was one the first to appear to assist
if necessary in the defence the old king
the scene the preceding night ran in his recollection
 and remembering the bloodstained
figure bonthron he conceived though indistinctly
that his act had been connected with
this uproar the subsequent and more interesting
discourse with sir john ramorny had
however been such an impressive nature as
to obliterate all traces what he had indistinctly
heard the bloody act the assassin
excepting a confused recollection that some one
or other had been slain it was chiefly on his
father's account that he had assumed arms with
his household train who clad in bright armour
and bearing lances in their hands made now
a figure very different from that the preceding
night when they appeared as intoxicated
bacchanalian the kind old monarch received
this mark filial attachment with tears gratitude
and proudly presented his son to his
brother albany who entered shortly after wards
he took them each by the hand
now are we three robin stewart he said
as inseparable as the holy trefoil and as
they say the wearer that sacred herb mocks
at magical delusion so we while we are true
to each other may set malice and enmity at defiance

the brother and son kissed the kind hand
which pressed theirs while robert iii expressed
his confidence in their affection the kiss 
the youth was for the time sincere that the
brother was the salute the apostate judas
in the meantime the bell saint john's
church alarmed amongst others the inhabitants
 curfew street in the house simon glover
old dorothy glover as she was called for she
also took name from the trade she practised
under her master's auspices was the first to
catch the sound though somewhat deaf upon
ordinary occasions her ear for bad news was as
sharp as a kite's scent for carrion for dorothy
otherwise an industrious faithful and even
affectionate creature had that strong appetite
for collecting and retailing sinister intelligence
which is often to be marked in the lower
classes little accustomed to be listened to
they love the attention which a tragic tale ensures
to the bearer and enjoy perhaps the temporary
equality to which misfortune reduces
those who are ordinarily accounted their superiors
dorothy had no sooner possessed hcrsel f
 a slight packet the rumours which were
flying abroad than she bounced into her mas
tcrs bedroom who had taken the privilege 
age and the holytide to sleep longer than usual
there he lies honest man said dorothy
half in a screeching and half in a wailing tone
 sympathy there he lies his best friend
slain and he knowing as little about it as the
babe new born that kens not life from death
how now said the glover starting up
out his bed what is the matter old woman
 is my daughter well 
old woman said dorothy who hadng
her fish hooked chose to let him play a little
i am not so old said she flouncing out 
the room as to bide in the place till a man
rises from his naked bed 
and presently she was heard at a distance in
the parlour beneath melodiously singing to the
scrubbing her own broom
 dorothy screechowl devil say but
my daughter is well 
e period already noticed
unrestrained by the considerations doubt
and hesitation which influenced others he repaired
to the parlour and having overheard
the bustling dame shoolbred he took the
privilege intimacy to ascend to the bedroom
and with the slight apology i crave your
pardon good neighbour he opened the door
and entered the apartment where a singular and
unexpected sight awaited him at the sound
 his voice may catharine experienced a revival
much speedier than dame shoolbred's restoratives
had been able to produce and the
paleness her complexion changed into a deep
glow the most lovely red she pushed her
lover from her with both her hands which
until this minute her want consciousness
or her affection awakened by the events the
morning had well nigh abandoned to his caresses
henry smith bashful as we know him
stumbled as he rose up and none the party
were without a share confusion excepting
dame shoolbred who was glad to make some
pretext to turn her back to the others in order
that she might enjoy a laugh at their expense
vol o 
which she felt herself utterly unable to restrain
and in which the glover whose surprise though
great was short duration and a joyful character
sincerely joined
now by good st john he said i thought
i had seen a sight this morning that would cure
me laughter at least till lent was over but
this would make me curl my cheek if i were
dying why here stands honest henry smith
who was lamented as dead and toll'd out for
from every steeple in town alive merry and
as it seems from his ruddy complexion as like
to live as any man in perth and here is my
precious daughter that yesterday would speak
 nothing but the wickedness the wights that
haunt profane sports and protect gleemaidens
ay she who set st valentine and st cupid
both at defiance here she is turned a gleemaiden
herself for what i can see truly i am
glad to see that you my good dame shoolbred
who give way to no disorder have been this
loving party
you do me wrong my dearest father said
catharine as if about to weep i came herewith
far different expectations than you suppose
i only came because because 
because you expected to find a dead lover
said her father and you have found a living
one who can receive the tokens your regard
and return them now were it not a sin i
could find in my heart to thank heaven that
thou hast been surprised at last into owning
thyself a woman simon glover is not worthy
to have an absolute saint for his daughter
nay look not so piteously nor expect condolence
from me only i will try not to look
merry if you will be pleased to stop your tears
or confess them to be tears joy
if i were to die for such a confession said
poor catharine i could not tell what to call
them only believe dear father and let henry
believe that i would never have come hither
unless unless 
unless you had thought that henry coukl
not come to you said her father and now
shake hands in peace and concord and agree as
valentines should yesterday was shrovetide
henry we will hold that thou hast confessed
thy follies hast obtained absolution and art
relieved all the guilt thou stoutest charged
with
nay touching that father simon said the
smith now that you are cool enough to hear
me i can swear on the gospels and i can call
my nurse dame shoolbred to witness 
nay nay said the glover but wherefore
rake up differences which should all be
forgotten 
hark ye simon simon glover this
was now echoed from beneath
true son smith said the glover seriously
 we have other work in hand you and
i must to the council instantly catharine
shall remain here with dame shoolbred who
will take charge her till we return and then
as the town is in misrule we two harry will
carry her home and they will be bold men that
cross us
 nay my dear father said catharine with
a smile now you are taking oliver proudfate's
office that doughty burgher is henry's
broth eratarms
her father's countenance grew dark
you have spoke a stinging word daughter 
but you know not what has happened kiss
him catharine in token forgiveness
not so said catharine i have done
him too much grace already when he has seen
the errant damsel safe home it will be time
enough to claim his reward
meantime said henry i will claim as
your host what you will not allow me on other
terms
he folded the fair maiden in his arms and
was permitted to take the salute which she had
refused to bestow
as they descended the stair together the old
man laid his hand on the smith's shoulder and
said henry my dearest wishes are fulfilled 
but it is the pleasure the saints that it should
be in an hour difficulty and terror
true said the smith but thou knowest
father if our riots be frequent at perth at
least they seldom last long
then opening a door which led from the
house into the smithy here comrade he
cried anton cuthbert dingwell and ringan
 let none you stir from the place till i
return be as true as the weapons i have taught
you to forge a french crown and a scottish
merrymaking for you if you obey my command
i leave a mighty treasure in your charge
watch the doors well let little jannekin scout
up and down the wynd and have your arms
ready if any one approaches the house open
the doors to no man till father glover or return
 it concerns my life and happiness
the strong swarthy giants to whom he spoke
answered death to him who attempts it 
my catharine is now as safe said he to
her father as if twenty men garrisoned a royal
castle in her cause we shall pass most quietly
to the councilhouse by walking through the
garden
he led the way through a little orchard accordingly
where the birds which had been sheltered
and fed during the winter by the goodnatured
artizan early in the season as it was
wire saluting the precarious smiles a february
sun with a few faint and interrupted attempts
at melody
hear these minstrels father said the
smith i laughed at them this morning in
the bitterness my heart because the little
wretches sung with so much winter before
them but now methinks i could bear a blithe
chorus for i have my valentine as they have
theirs and whatever ill may lie before me for
tomorrow i am today the happiest man in
perth city or county burgh or landward
yet i must allay your joy said the old
glover though heaven knows i share it 
poor oliver proudfute the inoffensive fool
that you and i knew so well has been found this
morning dead in the streets
only dead drunk i trust said the smith 
 nay a caudle and a dose matrimonial advice
will bring him to life again
no henry no he is slain slain with a
battleaxe or some such weapon
impossible replied the smith he was
lightfooted enough and would not for all
i
perth have trusted to his hands when he could
extricate himself by his heels
no choice was allowed him the blow was
dealt in the very back his head he who
struck must have been a shorter man than himself
and used a horseman's battleaxe or some
such weapon for a lochaberaxe must have
struck the upper part his head but there
he lies dead brained i may say by a most frightful
wound
this is inconceivable said henry wynd
he was in my house at midnight in a morriver's
habit seemed to have been drinking
though not to excess he told me a tale having
been beset by revellers and being in danger
 but alas you know the man i deemed
it was a swaggering fit as he sometimes took
when he was in liquor and may the merciful
virgin forgive me i let him go without company
in which i did him inhuman wrong holy
st john be my witness i would have gone with
any helpless creature and far more with him
with whom i have so often sat at the same board
and drunken the same cup who the race
 man could have thought harming a creature
 simple and so unoffending excepting by
his idle vaunts 
 henry he wore thy headpiece thy buffcoat
thy target how came he by these 
why he demanded the use them for the
night and i was ill at ease and well pleased
to be rid his company having kept no holiday
and being determined to keep none in respect
 our misunderstanding
it is the opinion bailie craigdallie and
all our sagest councillors that the blow was
intended for yourself and that it becomes you
to prosecute the due vengeance our fellowcitizen
who received the death which was meant
for you
the smith was for some time silent they
had now left the garden and were walking in a
lonely lane by which they meant to approach
the councilhouse the burgh without being
exposed to observation or idle inquiry
you are silent my son yet we two have
much to speak said simon glover bethink
thee that this widowed woman maudlin
if she should see cause to bring a charge against
any one for the wrong done to her and her orphan
children must support it by a champion
according to law and custom for be the murderer
who he may we know enough these
followers the nobles to be assured that the
party suspected will appeal to the combat in
derision perhaps those whom they will call
the cowardly burghers while we are men with
blood in our veins this must not be henry
wynd
i see where you would draw me father
answered henry dejectedly and st john
knows i have heard a summons to battle as
willingly as warhorse ever heard the trumpet
but bethink you father how i have lost
catharine's favour repeatedly and have been
driven well nigh to despair ever regaining
it for being if i may say so even too ready a
man my hands and here are all our quarrels
made up and the hopes that seemed this
morning removed beyond earthly prospect have
become nearer and brighter than ever and
must i with the dear one's kiss forgiveness
on my lips engage in a new scene violence
which you are well aware will give her the
deepest offence 
it is hard for me to advise you henry
said simon but this i must ask you have
you or have you not reason to think that this
poor unfortunate oliver has been mistaken for
you
i fear it too much said henry he was
thought something like me and the poor fool
had studied to ape my gestures and manner 
walking nay the very airs which i have the
trick whistling that he might increase a resemblance
which has cost him dear i have illwillers
enough both in burgh and landward to
owe me a shrewd turn and he i think could
have none such
 well henry i cannot say but my daughter
will be offended she has been much with
father clement and has received notions about
peace and forgiveness which methinks suit ill
with a country where the laws cannot protect
us unless we have spirit to protect ourselves
if you determine for the combat i will do my
best to persuade her to look ou the matter as
the other good womanhood in the burgh will
do and if you resolve to let the matter rest 
the man who has lost his life for yours remaining
unavenged the widow and the orphans
without any reparation for the loss a husband
and father i will then do you the justice to
remember that i at least ought not to think
the worse you for your patience since it was
adopted for love my child but henry we
must in that case remove ourselves from bonny
st johnstoun for here we will be but a disgraced
family
henry groaned deeply and was silent for an
instant then replied i would rather be dead
than dishonoured though i should never see her
again had it been yester evening i would
have met the best blade among these menatarms
as blithely as ever i danced at a maypole
but today when she had first as good as said
henry smith i love thee father glover
it is very hard yet it is all my own fault 
i ought to have allowed him the shelter my
roof lion lie prayed me in his agony fear 
or had i gone with lii i should then have
prevented or shared his fate but i taunted
him ridiculed him loaded him with maledictions
though the saints know they were uttered
in idle peevishness impatience i drove
him out from my doors whom i knew so helpless
to take the fate which was perhaps intended
for me i must avenge him or be dishonoured
for ever see father i have been
called a man hard as the steel i work in does
burnished steel ever drop tears like these 
shame on me that i should shed them 
it is no shame my dearest son said simon 
thou art as kind as brave and i have always
known it there is yet a chance for us no
one may be discovered to whom suspicion attaches
and where none such is found the combat
cannot take place it is a hard thing to
wish that the innocent blood may not be avenged
but if the perpetrator this foul murder
be hidden for the present thou wilt be saved
from the task seeking that vengeance which
heaven doubtless will take at its own proper
time
as they spoke thus they arrived at the point
 the high street where the councilhouse was
situated as they reached the door and made
their way through the multitude who still
thronged the street they found the avenues
guarded by a select party armed burghers
and about fifty spears belonging to the knight
 kinfauns who with his allies the grays
blairs moncrieffs and others had brought to
perth a considerable body horse which
these were a part so soon as the glover and
smith presented themselves they were admitted
to the chamber in which the magistrates
were assembled

chapter viii
the councilroom perth presented a singular
spectacle in a gloomy apartment ill
and inconveniently lighted by two windows
 different form and unequal size were assembled
around a large oaken table a group 
men whom those who occupied the higher
seats were merchants that is guild brethren
or shopkeepers arrayed in decent dresses becoming
their station but most them bearing
like the regent york signs war around
their aged necks gorgets namely and baltricks
which sustained their weapons the
lower places around the table were occupied
by mechanics and artisans the presidents or
deacons as they were termed the working
classes in their ordinary clothes somewhat better
arranged than usual these too wore pieces
 armour various descriptions some had
the black jack or doublet covered with small
plates iron a lozenge shape which secured
through the upper angle hung in rows
above each and which swaying with the motion
 the wearer's person formed a secure defence
to the body others had buffcoats which
as already mentioned could resist the blow 
a sword and even a lance's point unless propelled
with great force at the bottom the
table surrounded as it was with this varied assembly
sat sir louis lundin no military man
but a priest and parson st john's arrayed in
his canonical dress and having his pen and ink
before him he was townclerk the burgh and
like all the priests the period who were called
from that circumstance the pope's knights
received the honourable title dominus contracted
into dom or dan or translated into
sir the title reverence due to the secular
chivalry
on an elevated seat at the head the council
board was placed sir patrick charteris incomplete
armour brightly burnished a singular
contrast to the motley mixture warlike
and peaceful attire exhibited by the burghers
who were only called to arms occasionally
the bearing the provost while it completely
admitted the intimate connexion which mutual
interests had created betwixt himself the burgh
and the magistracy was at the same time calculated
to assert the superiority which in virtue
 gentle blood and chivalrous rank the
opinions the age assigned to him over the
members the assembly in which he presided
two squires stood behind him one them
holding the knight's pennon and another his
shield bearing his armorial distinctions being
a hand holding a dagger or short sword with
the proud motto this is my charter a handsome
page displayed the long sword his master
and another bore his lance all which chivalrous
emblems and appurtenances were the
more scrupulously exhibited that the dignitary
vol p
to whom they belonged was engaged in discharging
the office a burgh magistrate in his own
person the knight kinfauns appeared to affect
something state and stiffness which did
not naturally pertain to his frank and jovial
character
 so you are come at length henry smith
and simon glover said the provost know
that you have kept us waiting for your attendance
should it so chance again while we occupy
this place we will lay such a fine on you
as you will have small pleasure in paying
enough make no excuses they are not asked
now and another time they will not be admitted
know sirs that our reverend clerk hath
taken down in writing and at full length what
i will tell you in brief that you may see what
is to be required you henry smith in particular
our late fellowcitizen oliver proudfate
hath been found dead in the high street
close by the entrance into the wynd it seemeth
he was slain by a heavy blow with a short axe
dealt from behind and at unawares and the act
bv which he fell can only be termed a deed 
foul and forethoiiglit murder so much for the
crime the criminal can only be indicated hy
circumstances it is recorded in the protocol 
the reverend sir louis lundin that divers
wellreputed witnesses saw our deceased citizen
oliver proudfute till a late period accompanying
the entry the morrisdancers whom
he was one as far as the house simon glover
in curfew street where they again played
their pageant it is also manifested that at
this place he separated from the rest the
band after some discourse with simon glover
and made an appointment to meet with the
others his company at the sign the griffin
there to conclude the holiday now simon
i demand you whether this be truly stated
so far as you know and further what was the
purport the defunct oliver proudfute's discourse
with you 
 my lord provost and very worshipful sir
patrick answered simon glover you and
this honourable council shall know that touching
certain reports which had been made ie
conduct henry smith some quarrel lead

arisen between myself and another my family
and the said smith here present now
this our poor fellowcitizen oliver proudfute
having been active in spreading these reports
as indeed his element lay in such gossipred
some words passed betwixt him and me on the
subject and as i think he left me with the
purpose visiting henry smith for he broke
off from the morrisdancers promising as it
seems to meet them as your honour has said
at the sign the griffin in order to conclude
the evening but what he actually did i know
not as i never again saw him in life
it is enough said sir patrick and agrees
with all that we have heard now worthy sirs
we next find our poor fellowcitizen environed
by a set revellers and maskers who had assembled
in the high street by whom he was
shamefully ill treated being compelled to kneel
down in the street and there to quaff huge
quantities liquor against his inclination until
at length he escaped from them by flight this
violence was accomplished with drawn swords
loud shouts and imprecations so as to attract the
attention several persons who alarmed by
the tumult looked out from their windows as
well as one or two passengers who keeping
aloof from the light the torches lest they also
had been maltreated beheld the usage which
our fellowcitizen received in the high street 
the burgh and although these revellers were
disguised and used zads yet their disguises
were well known being a set quaint masking
habits prepared some weeks ago by command
 sir john ramorny master the
horse to his royal highness the duke rothsay
prince royal scotland
a low groan went through the assembly
yes so it is brave burghers continued sir
patrick our inquiries have led us into conclusions
both melancholy and terrible but as
no one can regret the point at which they seem
likely to arrive more than i do so no mau living
can dread its consequences less it is even so
various artisans employed upon the articles
have described the dresses prepared for sir john
jlamornv's mask as beinjr exactly similar to
those oi the men by whom oliver proudtutc was
observed to be maltreated and one mechanic
being whitfield the featherdresser who saw
the revellers when they had our fellowcitizen
within their hands remarked that they wore
the cincture and coronals painted feathers
which he himself had made by the order the
prince's master the horse
after the moment his escape from these
revellers we lose all trace oliver but we
can prove that the maskers went to sir john
ramorny's where they were admitted after
some show delay it is rumoured that thou
henry smith safest our unhappy fellowcitizen
after he had been in the hands these revellers
 what is the truth that matter 
he came to my house in she wynd said
henry about half an hour before midnight 
and i admitted him something unwillingly ashe
had been keeping carnival while i remained
at home and there is ill talk says the proverb
betwixt a full man and a fasting
 and in which plight seemed he when thou
didst admit him said the provost
he seemed answered the smith out 
breath and talked repeatedly having been endangered
by revellers i paid but small regard
for he was ever a timorous chickenspirited
though wellmeaning man and i held that m
was speaking more from fancy than reality but
i shall always account it for foul offence in myself
that i did not give him my company which
he requested and if i live i will found masses
for his soul in expiation my guilt
did he describe those from whom he received
the injury said the provost
revellers in masking habits replied henry
 and did he intimate his fear having todo
with them on his return again demanded
sir patrick
he alluded particularly to his being waylaid
which i treated as visionary having been
able to see no one in the lane
had he then no help from thee any kind
whatsoever said the provost
yes worshipful replied the smith he
exchanged his morris dress for my headpiece
buffcoat and target which i hear were found
iipou his body and have at home his morricc
cap and bells with the jerkin and other things
pertaining he was to return my garb fence
and get back his own masking suit this day had
the saints so permitted
 you saw him not then afterwards 
 never my lord
one word more said the provost have
you any reason to think that the blow which
slew oliver proudfute was meant for another
man 
i have answered the smith but it is
doubtful and may be dangerous to add such a
conjecture which is besides only a supposition
speak it out on your burgher faith and oath
for whom think you was the blow meant 
 if i must speak replied henry i believe
oliver proudfute received the fate which was
designed for myself the rather that in his folly
oliver spoke trying to assume my manner 
walking as well as my dress
 have you feud with any one that you form
such an idea said sir patrick charters
 to my shame and sin be it spoken ha c
loud whli iligliland and lowland english and
scot perth and angus i do not believe poor
oliver had feud with a newhatched chicken 
alas he was the more fully prepared for a sudden
call 
 hark ye smith said the provost answer
me distinctly is there cause feud between
the household sir john ramorny and
yourself
to a certainty my lord there is it is now
generally said that black quentin who went
over tay to fife some days since was the owner
 the hand which was found in couvrefew
street upon the eve st valentine it was i
who struck off that hand with a blow my
broadsword as this black quentin was a
chamberlain sir john and much trusted it
is like there must be feud between me and his
master's dependents
it bears a likely front smith said sir patrick
charteris and now good brothers and
wise magistrates there are two suppositions
each which leads to the same conclusion the
makerswho seized our fellow citizen and misused
liii in a manner which his body retains
some slight marks may have met with their
former prisoner as he returned homewards and
finished their ill usage by taking his life he
himself expressed to henry gow fears that this
would be the case if this be really true one
or more sir john ramorny's attendants
must have been the assassins but i think it
more likely that one or two the revellers may
have remained on the field or returned to it
having changed perhaps their disguise and that
to those men for oliver proudfute in his own
personal appearance would only have been a
subject sport his apparition in the dress and
assuming as he proposed to do the manner
 henry smith was matter deep hatred
and that seeing him alone they had taken as
they thought a certain and safe mode to rid
themselves an enemy so dangerous as all men
know henry wynd is accounted by those that
are his friends the same train reasoning
again rests the guilt with the household sir
john ramorny how think you siis are
we not free to charge the crime upon them 
the magistrates whispered together for several
minutes and then replied by the voice 
bailie craigdallie noble knight and our
worthy provost we agree entirely in what
your wisdom has spoken concerning this dark
and bloody matter nor do we doubt your sagacity
in tracing to the fellowship and the company
 john ramorny that ilk the villainy
which hath been done to our deceased fellowcitizen
whether in his own character and capacity
or as mistaking him for our brave townsman
henry the wynd but sir john in his
own behalf and as the prince's master the
horse maintains an extensive household and
as course the charge will be rebutted by a denial
we would ask how we shall proceed in that
case it is true could we find law for firing
the lodging and putting all within it to the
sword the old proverb short rede good
rede might here apply for a fouler household
 defiers god destroyers men and debauchery
 women are nowhere sheltered than
are in ramorny's band but i doubt that this
summary mode execution would scarce be
burne out by the laws and no tittle evidence
which i have heard will tend to fix the crime
on any single individual or individuals
before the provost could reply the townclerk
arose and stroking his venerable beard
craved permission to speak which was instantly
granted brethren he said as well in
our fathers time as ours hath god on being
rightly appealed to condescended to make manifest
the crimes the guilty and the innocence
 those who may have been rashly accused
let us demand from our sovereign lord king
robert who when the wicked do not interfere
to pervert his good intentions is as just and
clement a prince as our annals can show in
their long line in the name the fair city and
 all the commons in scotland that he give us
after the fashion our ancestors the means 
appealing to heaven for light upon this dark
murder we will demand the proof by hierrights
often granted in the days our sovereign's
ancestors approved by bulls and decretals
and administered by the great emperor
charlemagne in france by king artlinr in
britain and by gregory the great and the
mighty aclriius in this our land scotland
i have heard the bierright sir louis
fjuoth the provost and i know we have it in
our charters the fail city but i am something
illlearned in the ancient laws and would
pray you to inform us more distinctly its nature

 we will demand the king said sir
louis lundin my advice being taken that the
body our murdered fellowcitizen be transported
into the high church st john's and
suitable masses said for the benefit his soul
and for the discovery his foul murder meantime
we shall obtain an order that sir john ramorn
give up a list such his household
as were in perth in the course the night between
fastern's even and this ash wednesday
and become bound to present them on a certain
day and hour to be early named in the high
church st john's there one by one to pass
before the bier our murdered fellow citizen
and in trio form prescribed to call upon god and
his saints to bear witness that he is innocent 
the acting art or part the murder and
credit me as has been indeed proved by numerous
instances that if the murderer shall endeavour
to shroud himself by making such an appeal
the antipathy which subsists between the
dead body and the hand which dealt the fatal
blow that divorced it from the soul will awaken
some imperfect life under the influence which
the veins the dead man will pour forth at the
fatal wounds the blood which has been so long
stagnant in the veins or to speak more certainly
it is the pleasure heaven by some
hidden agency which we cannot comprehend to
leave open this mode discovering the wickedness
 him who has defaced the image his
creator
i have heard this law talked said sir
patrick and it was enforced in the bruce's
time this surely is no unfit period to seek by
such a mystic mode inquiry the truth to
which no ordinary means can give us access
seeing that a general accusation sir john's
household would full surely be met by a general
denial yet i must crave farther sir
louis our reverend townclerk how we shall
prevent the guilty person from escaping in the
interim 
 the burghers will maintain a strict watch
upon the wall drawbridges shall be raised
and portcullises lowered from sunset to sunrise
and strong patrols maintained through the
night this guard the burghers will willingly
maintain to secure against the escape the
murderer their townsman
the rest the councillors acquiesced byword
sign and look in this proposal
again said the provost what if anyone
 the suspected household refuse to submit
to the ordeal bierright 
he may appeal to that combat said
the reverend city scribe with an opponent
 equal rank because the accused person must
have his choice in the appeal to the judgment
 god by what ordeal he will be tried but
if he refuses both he must be held as guilty
and so punished
the sages the council unanimously agreed
with the opinion their provost and townclerk
and resolved in all formality to petition
the king as a matter right that the murder
 their fellowcitizen should be inquired into
according to this ancient form which was held
to manifest the truth and received as matter 
evidence in case murder so late as towards
the the seventeenth century but before
the meeting dissolved bailie craigdallie thought
it meet to inquire who was to be the champion
 maudie or magdalen proudfute and her
two children
 there need be little inquiry about that
said sir patrick charteris we are men and
wear swords which should be broken over the
head any one amongst us who will not draw
it in behalf the widow and orphans our
murdered fellowcitizen and in brave revenge
 his death if sir john ramorny shall personally
resent the inquiry patrick charteris 
kinfauns will do battle with him to the outrance
whilst horse and man may stand or spear
and blade hold together but in case the challenger
be yeomanly degree well wot i that
magdalen proudfute may choose her own champion
among the bravest burghers perth and
shame and dishonour were it to the fair city
for ever could she light upon one who was traitor
and coward enough to say her nay bring
her hither that she may make her election
henry smith heard this with a melancholy
anticipation that the poor woman's choice would
light upon him and that his recent reconciliation
with his mistress would be again dissolved
by his being engaged in a fresh quarrel from
which there lay no honourable means escape
and which in any other circumstances
he would have welcomed as a glorious opportunity
 distinguishing himself both in sight 
the court and the city he was aware that
under the tuition father clement catharine
viewed the ordeal battle rather as an
insult to religion than an appeal to the deity
and did not consider it as reasonable that superior
strength arm or skill weapon
should be resorted to as the proof moral
vol 
guilt or innocence he had therefore much
to fear from her peculiar opinions in this particular
refined as they were beyond those 
the age she lived in
while he thus suffered under these contending
feelings magdalen the widow the slaughtered
man entered the court wrapt in a deep mourning
veil and followed and supported by five or
six women good that is respectability
dressed in the same melancholy attire one 
her attendants held an infant in her arms the
last pledge poor oliver's nuptial affections
another led a little tottering creature two
years or thereabouts which looked with wonder
and fear sometimes on the black dress in
which they had muffled him and sometimes on
the scene around him
the assembly rose to receive the melancholy
group and saluted them with an expression 
the deepest sympathy which magdalen though
the mate poor oliver returned with an air
 dignity which she borrowed perhaps from
the extremity her distress sir patrick charters
then stepped forward and with the courtesy
 a knight to a female and a protector
to an oppressed and injured widow took the poor
woman's hand and explained to her briefly by
what course the city had resolved to follow out
the vengeance due for her husband's slaughter
having with a softness and gentleness which
did not belong to his general manner ascertained
that the unfortunate woman perfectly
understood what was meant he said aloud to the
assembly goodcitizensof perth and freeborn
men guild and craft attend to what is about
to pass foritconcerns your rights and privileges
here stands magdalen proudfute desirous to
follow forth the revenge due for the death 
her husband foully murdered as she sayeth
by sir john ramorny knight that ilk and
which she offers to prove by the evidence 
bierright or by the body a man therefore
i patrick charteris being a belted knight and
freeborn gentleman offer myself to do battle
in her just quarrel whilst man and horse may
endure if any one my degree shall lift my
glove how say you magdalen proudfute
will you accept me for your champion 
the widow answered with difficulty i
can desire none nobler
sir patrick then took her right hand in his
and kissing her forehead for such was the
ceremony said solemnly so may god
and st john prosper me at my need as i will
do my devoir as your champion knightly
truly and manfully go now magdalen and
choose at your will among the burgesses the
fair city present or absent anyone upon whom
you desire to rest your challenge if he against
whom you bring plaint shall prove to be beneath
my degree
all eyes were turned to henry smith whom
the general voice had already pointed out as in
every respect the fittest to act as champion on
the occasion but the widow waited not for the
general prompting their looks as soon as
sir patrick had spoken she crossed the floor to
the place where near the bottom the table
the armourer stood among the men his degree
and took him by the hand 
henry gow or smith she said good
burgher and craftsman my my 
husband she would have said but the word
would not come forth she was obliged to
change the expression
he who is gone loved and prized you overall
men therefore meet it is that thou shouldst
follow out the quarrel his widow and orphans

if there had been a possibility which in that
age there was not henry's rejecting or escaping
from a trust for which all men seemed
to destine him every wish and idea retreat
was cut off when the widow began to address
him and a command from heaven could hardly
have made a stronger impression than did the
appeal the unfortunate magdalen her allusion
to his intimacy with the deceased moved
him to the soul during oliver's life doubtless
there had been a strain absurdity in his
excessive predilection for henry which considering
how very different they were in character
had in it something ludicrous but all this
was now forgotten and henry giving way to
his natural ardour only remembered that oliver
had been his friend and intimate a man
who had loved and honoured him as much as he
was capable entertaining such sentiments for
any one and above all that there was much reason
to suspect that the deceased had fallen victim
to a blow meant for henry himself
it was therefore with an alacrity which the
minute before he could scarce have commanded
and which seemed to express a stern pleasure
that having pressed his lips to the cold
brow the unhappy magdalen the armourer
replied 
i henry the smith dwelling in the wynd
 perth good man and true and freely born
accept the office champion to this widow
magdalen and these orphans and will do battle
in their quarrel to the death with any man
whomsoever my own degree and that so long
as i shall draw breath so help me at my need
god and good st john 
there rose from the audience a half suppressed
cry expressing the interest which the persons
present took in the prosecution the quarrel
and their confidence in the issue
sir patrick charteris then took measures for
repairing to the king's presence and demanding
leave to proceed with inquiry into the murder
 oliver proudfute according to the custom
 bierright and if necessary by combat
he performed this duty after the towncouncil
had dissolved in a private interview between
himself and the king who heard this new
trouble with much vexation and appointed next
morning after mass for sir patrick and the
parties interested to attend his pleasure in
council in the meantime a royal pursuivant
was dispatched to the constable's lodgings to
call over the roll sir john ramorny's attendants
and charge him with his whole retinue
under high penalties to abide within perth
until the king's pleasure should be farther
known
chapter 
in goa'h name see the lists and all things fit 
there let them it god defend the right 
henri part 
in the same councilroom the conventual
palace the dominicans king robert was
seated with his brother albany whose affected
austerity virtue and real art and dissimulation
maintained so high an influence over the
feebleminded monarch it was indeed natural
that one who seldom saw things according to
their real forms and outlines should view them
according to the light in which they were presented
to him by a bold studious man possessing
the claim such near relationship
ever anxious on account his misguided
and unfortunate son the king was now endeavouring
to make albany coincide in opinion
with him in exculpating rothsay from any part
in the death the bonnetmaker the precognition
concerning which had been left by sir
patrick charteris for his majesty's consideration

this is an unhappy matter brother robin
he said a most unhappy occurrence and
goes nigh to put strife and quarrel betwixt the
nobility and the commons here as they have
been at war together in so many distant lands
i see but one cause comfort in the matter 
and that is that sir john ramorny having received
his dismissal from the duke rothsay's
family it cannot be said that he or any his
people who may have done this bloody deed if
it has truly been done by them have been encouraged
or hounded out upon such an errand
by my poor robin i am sure brother you and
i can bear witness how readily upon my entreaties
he agreed to dismiss ramorny from
his service on account that brawl in curfew
street
i remember his doing so said albany
and well do i hope that the connexion betwixt
the prince and ramorny has not been
renewed since he seemed to comply with your
grace's wishes
seemed to comply the connexion renewed
said the king what mean you by
these expressions brother surely when robin
promised to me that if that unhappy matter
 curfew street were but smothered up
and concealed he would part with ramorny
as he was a counsellor thought capable involving
him in similar fooleries and would acquiesce
in our inflicting on him either exile or
such punishment as it should please us to impose
 surely you cannot doubt that he was sincere
in his professions and would keep his
word remember you not that when you advised
that a heavy fine should be levied upon
his estate in fife in lieu banishment the
prince himself seemed to say that exile would
be better for ramorny and even for himself 
i remember it well my royal brother
nor truly could i have suspected ramorny 
having so much influence over the prince after
having been accessary to placing him in a situation
so perilous had it not been for my royal
kinsman's own confession alluded to by your
grace that if suffered to remain at court he
might still continue to direct his conduct i
then regretted i had advised a fine in place 
exile but that time is passed and now new
mischief has occurred fraught with much peril
to your majesty as well as to your royal heir
and to the whole kingdom
what mean you robin said the weakminded
king by the tomb our parents 
by the soul bruce our immortal ancestor 
i entreat thee my dearest brother to take compassion
on me tell me what evil threatens
my son or my kingdom 
the features the king trembling with
anxiety and his eyes brimful tears were
bent upon his brother who seemed to assume
time for consideration ere he replied
my lord the danger lies here your grace
believes that the prince had no accession to this
second aggression upon the citizens perth 
the slaughter this bonnetmaking fellow
about whose death they clamour as a set 
gulls about tlmjir comrade when one the
noisy brood is struck down by a boy's shaft
their lives said the king are dear to
themselves and their friends robin
truly ay my liege and they make them
dear to us too ere we can settle with the knaves
for the least blood witt but as i said your
majesty thinks the prince had no share in this
last slaughter i will not attempt to shake your
belief in that delicate point but will endeavour
to believe along with you what you think is
rule for me robin albany will never think
otherwise than robin broad scotland
thank you thank you said the king taking
his brother's hand i knew i might rely
that your affection would do justice to poor
heedless rothsay who exposes himself to so
much misconstruction that he scarcely deserves
the sentiments you feel for him
albany had such an immovable constancy
 purpose that he was able to return the fraternal
pressure the king's hand while tearing
up by the very roots the hopes the indulgent
fond old man
 but alas the duke continued with a sigh
this burly intractable knight kinfauns
and his brawling herd burghers will not
view the matter as we do they have the boldness
to say that this dead fellow had been misused
by rothsay and his fellows who were in
the street in mask and revel stopping men and
women compelling them to dance or to drink
huge quantities wine with other follies needless
to recount and they say that the whole
party repaired to sir john ramorny's and
broke their way into the house in order to conclude
their revel there thus affording good
reason to judge that the dismissal sir john
from the prince's service was but a feigned
stratagem to deceive the public and hence
they urge that if ill were done that night by
sir john ramorny or his followers much it is
to be thought that the duke rothsay must
have at least been privy to if he did not authorize
it
albany this is dreadful said the king 
would they make a murderer my boy 
would they pretend my son would soil his hands
ill scottish blood without having either provocation
or purpose no no they will not invent
calumnies so broad as these for they are
flagrant and incredible
pardon my liege answered the duke 
albany they say the cause quarrel which
occasioned the riot in curfew street and the
consequences was more proper to the prince
than to sir john since none suspects far less
believes that that hopeful enterprise was conducted
for the gratification the knight 
ramorny
thou drives me mad robin said the
king
i am dumb answered his brother i
did but speak my poor mind according to your
royal order
thou meanest well i know said the
king but instead tearing me to pieces
with the display inevitable calamities were
it not kinder robin to point me out some mode
to escape from them 
true my liege but as the only road 
extrication is rough and difficult it is necessary
your grace should be first possessed with the
absolute necessity using it ere you hear it
even described the chirurgeon must first convince
his patient the incurable condition 
a shattered member ere he venture to name
amputation though it be the only remedy
robert at these words was roused to a degree
 alarm and indignation greater than his
brother had deemed he could be awakened to
 shattered and mortified member my lord
 albany amputation the only remedy 
these are unintelligible words my lord if
thou applies them to our son roth say thou
must make them good to the letter else mayst
thou have bitter cause to rue the consequence
you construe me too literally my royal
liege said albany i spoke not the prince
in such unbeseeming terms for i call heaven
to witness that he is dearer to me as the son 
a wellbeloved brother than had he been son
 my own but i spoke in regard to separating
him from the follies and vanities life
which holy men say are like to mortified member's
and ought like them to be cut off and
thrown from us as things which interrupt our
progress in better things
i understand thou wouldst have this ramorn
who hath been thought the instrument
 my son's follies exiled from court said the
relieved monarch until these unhappy scandals
are forgotten and our subjects are disposed
to look upon our son with different and
more confiding eyes
that were good counsel my liege but
mine went a little a very little farther i
would have the prince himself removed for
some brief period from court
how albany part with my child my
firstborn the light my eyes and wilful ashe
is the darling my heart oh robin 
i cannot and i will not
nay i did but suggest my lord i am sensible
 the wound such a proceeding must inflict
on a parentis heart for am i not myself a
father and he hung his head as if in hopeless
despondency
i could not survive it albany when i
think that even our own influence over him
which sometimes forgotten in our absence u
ever effectual whilst he is with us is by your
plan to be entirely removed what perils might
he not rush upon i could not sleep in his absence
 i should hear his deathgroan in every
breeze and you albany though you conceal
it better would be nearly as anxious
thus spoke the facile monarch willing to
conciliate his brother and cheat himself by taking
it for granted that an affection which
there were no traces subsisted betwixt the uncle
and nephew
your paternal apprehensions are too easily
alarmed my lord said albany i do not
propose to leave the disposal the prince's motions
to his own wild pleasure i understand
that the prince is to be placed for a short time
under some becoming restraint that he should
be subjected to the charge some grave counsellor
who must be responsible both for this conduct
and his safety as a tutor for his pupil
how a tutor and at rothsay's age
vol r
exclaimed the king he is two years beyond
the space to which our laws limit the term 
nonage
 the wiser romans said albany extended
it for four years after the period we assign
 and in common sense the right control
ought to last till it be no longer necessary
and so the time ought to vary with the disposition
here is young lindsay the earl crawford
who they say gives patronage to ramorny
on this appeal he is a lad fifteen with the
deep passions and fixed purpose a man 
thirty while my royal nephew with much more
amiable and noble qualities both head and
heart sometimes shows at twentythree years
 age the wanton humours a boy towards
whom restraint may be kindness and do not
be discouraged that it is so my liege or angry
with your brother for telling the truth since the
best fruits are those that are slowest in ripening
and the best horses such as give most trouble
to the grooms who train them for the field
or lists
the duke stopped and after suffering king
robert to indulge for two or three minutes in a
reverie wliieli lie did not attempt to interrupt
he added in a more lively tone but cheer
up my noble liege perhaps the feud may be
made up without farther fighting or difficulty
the widow is poor for her husband though he
was much employed had idle and costly habits
the matter may be therefore redeemed for money
and the amount an assythment may be
recovered out ramorny's estate
 nay that we will ourselves discharge
said king robert eagerly catching at the hope
 a pacific termination this unpleasing debate
 ramorny's prospects vill be destroyed
by his being sent from court and deprived 
his charge in rothsay's household and it would
be ungenerous to load a falling man but here
comes our secretary the prior to tell us the
hour council approaches good morrow my
worthy father
benedicite my royal liege answered the
abbot
now good father continued the king
 a mulct in atonement for bloodshed due to the nearest relations
 the deceased
 without waiting for rotlisay whose accession
to our counsels we will ourselves guarantee
proceed we to the business our kingdom
what advices have you from the douglas

he has arrived at his castle pantaloon
my liege and has sent a post to say that though
the earl march remains in sullen seclusion
in his fortress dunbar his friends and followers
are gathering and forming an encampment
near nottingham where it is supposed
they intend to await the arrival a large force
 english which hotspur and sir ralph percy
are assembling on the english frontier
that is cold news said the king and
may god forgive george dunbar the
prince entered as he spoke and he continued 
ha thou art here at length rothsay i saw
thee not at mass
i was an idler this morning said the
prince having spent a restless and feverish
night
ah foolish boy answered the kinghadst
thou not been over restless on eastern's
eve thou last not been feverish on the
night ash wednesday
let me not interrupt your prayers my
liege said the prince lightly your grace
was invoking heaven in behalf some one 
an enemy doubtless for these have the frequent
advantage your orisons
sit down and be at peace foolish youth 
said his father his eye resting at the same time
on the handsome face and graceful figure his
favourite son roth say drew a cushion near to
his father's feet and threw himself carelessly
down upon it while the king resumed
i was regretting that the earl march
having separated warm from my hand with full
assurance that he should receive compensation
for everything which he could complain as
injurious should have been capable caballing
with northumberland against his own country 
is it possible he could doubt our intentions to
make good our word 
i will answer for him no said the prince 
march never doubted your highness's word
aviary he may well have made question whether
your learned councillors would leave your majesty
the power keeping it
robert the third had adopted to a great extent
the timid policy not seeming to hear expressions
which being heard required even in
his own eyes some display displeasure he
passed on therefore in his discourse without
observing his son's speech but in private rothsay's
rashness augmented the displeasure which
his father began to entertain against him
it is well the douglas is on the marches
said the king his breast like those his
ancestors has ever been the best bulwark 
scotland
 then woe betide us if he should turn his
back said the incorrigible rothsay
 dare you impeach the courage douglas
 replied the king extremely chafed
 no man dare question the earl's courage
said rothsay it is certain as his pride but
his luck may be something doubted else have
the annals his house given him the name 
tineman for nothing
t'lnc'vuni i c loseman
 by saint andrew robin exclaimed his
father thou art like a screechowl every word
thou mayest betokens strife and calamity
i am silent father answered the youth
and what news our highland disturbances
continued the king addressing the
prior
i trust they have assumed a favourable
aspect answered the clergyman the fire
which threatened the whole country is likely to
be drenched out by the blood some forty or
fifty kerne for the two great confederacies have
agreed i y solemn indenture arms to decide
their quarrel with such weapons as your highness
may name and in your royal presence in
such place as shall be appointed on the th 
march next to come being palm sunday the
number combatants being limited to thirty on
each side and the fight to be maintained to extremity
since they affectionately make humble
suit and petition to your majesty that you will
parentally condescend to wave for the day your
royal privilege interrupting the combat by
flinging down uf truncheon or crying ho 

until the battle shall be utterly fought to an

 the wild savages exclaimed the king 
would they limit our best and dearest royal
privilege that putting a stop to strife and
crying truce to battle will they remove the
only motive which could bring me to the butcherly
spectacle their combat would they
fight like men or like their own mountain
wolves 
my lord said albany the earl 
crawford and i had presumed without consulting
you to ratify that preliminary for the
adoption which we saw much and pressing
reason
how the earl crawford said the
king me thinks he is a young counsellor on
such grave occurrence
he is replied albany notwithstanding
his early years such esteem among his highland
neighbours that i could have done little
with them but for his aid and influence
hear this young rothsay said the king
reproachfully to his heir
i pity crawford sire replied the prince
he has too early lost a father whose councils
would have better become such a season as
this
the king turned next towards albany with
a look triumph at the filial affection which
his son displayed in his reply
albany proceeded without emotion it is
not the life these highlander but their
death which is to be profitable to this commonwealth
 scotland and truly it seemed to the
earl crawford and myself most desirable
that the combat should be a strife extermination

marry said the prince if such be the
juvenile policy lindsay he will be a merciful
ruler some ten or twelve years hence out
upon a boy that is hard heart before he has
hair upon his lip better he had contented himself
with fighting cocks on pastern's even than
laying schemes for massacring men on palm
sunday as if he were backing a welsh main
where all must fight to death
 robin says right albany said the king
 it were unlike a christian monarch to gie
way in this point i cannot consent to see men
battle until they are all hewn down like cattle
in the shambles it would sicken me to look at
it and the warder would drop from ray hand
for mere lack strength to hold it
it would drop unheeded said albany
 let me entreat your grace to recollect that
you only give up a royal privilege which exercised
would win you no respect since it would
receive no obedience were your majesty to
throw down your warder when the war is high
and these men's blood is hot it would meet no
more regard than if a sparrow should drop
among a herd battling wolves the straw which
he was carrying to his nest nothing will separate
them but the exhaustion slaughter 
and better they sustain it at the hands each
other than from the swords such troops as
might attempt to separate them at your majesty's
commands an attempt to keep the peace
by violence would be construed into an ambush
laid for them both parties would unite to resist
it the slaughter would be the same and the
g
hopedfor results future peace would be utterly
disappointed
there is even too much truth in what you
say brother robin replied the flexible king
to little purpose is it to command what i cannot
enforce and although i have the unhappiness
to do so each day my life it were needless
to give such a public example royal impotency
before the crowds who may assemble to
behold this spectacle let these savage men
therefore work their bloody will to the uttermost
upon each other i will not attempt to forbid
what i cannot prevent them from executing
 heaven help this wretched country i
will to my oratory and pray for her since to
aid her by hand and head is alike denied to me
father prior i pray the support your arms
but brother said albany forgive
me if i remind you that we must hear the matter
between the citizens perth and ramoruy
about the death a townsman 
true true said the monarch reseating
himself more violence more battle oh
scotland scotland if the best blood thy
g
bravest children could enrich thy barren soil
what land on earth would excel thee in fertility
 when is it that a white hair is seen on the
beard a scottish man unless he be some
wretch like thy sovereign protected from murder
by impotence to witness the scenes 
slaughter to which he cannot put a period 
let them come in delay them not they are
in haste to kill and grudge each other each fresh
breath their creator's blessed air the demon
 strife and slaughter hath possessed the
whole land 
as the mild prince threw himself back on
his seat with an air impatience and anger
not very usual with him the door at the lower
 the room was unclosed and advancing
from the gallery into which it led where in perspective
was seen a guard the butemen or
brandanes under arms came in mournful
procession the widow poor oliver led by sir
patrick charteris with as much respect as if
she had been a lady the first rank behind
them came two women good the wives 
magistrates the city both in mourning garments
one bearing the infant and the other
leading the elder child the smith followed in
his best attire and wearing over his buffcoat
a scarf crape bailie craigdallie and a brother
magistrate closed the mournful procession
exhibiting similar marks mourning
the good king's transitory passion was gone
the instant he looked on the pallid countenance
 the sorrowing widow and beheld the unconsciousness
 the innocent orphans who had
sustained so great a loss and when sir patrick
charteris had assisted magdalen proudfute to
kneel down and still holding her hand kneeled
himself on one knee it was with a sympathetic
tone that king robert asked her name
and business she made no answer but muttered
something looking towards her conductor
speak for the poor woman sir patrick
charteris said the king and tell us the
cause her seeking our presence
so please you my liege answered sir
patrick rising up this woman and these unhappy
orphans make plaint to your highness
upon sir john ramorny ramorny knight
that by lii or by some his household lier
iimquhile husband oliver proudfute freeman
and burgess perth was slain upon the streets
 the city on the eve shrove tuesday or
morning ash wednesday
woman replied the king with much
kindness thou art gentle by sex and should'st
be pitiful even by thy affliction for our own
calamity ought to make us nay i think it doth
make us merciful to others thy husband hath
only trodden the path appointed to us all
 in his case said the widow my liege
must remember it has been a brief and a bloody
one
 i agree he hath had foul measure but
since i have been unable to protect him as i
confess was my royal duty i am willing in
atonement to support thee and these orphans
as well or better than you lived in the days 
your husband only do thou pass from this
charge and be not the occasion spilling more
life remember i put before you the choice
betwixt practising mercy and pursuing vengeance
and that betwixt plenty and pcnurv
it is true my liege we arc poor answer 
ed the widow with unshaken firmness but
i and my children will feed with the beasts 
the field ere we live on the price my husband's
blood i demand the combat by my
champion as you are belted knight and crowned
king
i knew it would be so said the king
aside to albany in scotland the first words
stammered by an infant and the last uttered
by a dying greybeard are combat blood 
revenge it skills not arguing further admit
the defendants
sir john ramorny entered the apartment
he was dressed in a long furred robe such as
men quality wore when they were unarmed
concealed by the folds drapery his wounded
arm was supported by a scarf or sling 
crimson silk and with the left arm he leaned
on a youth who scarcely beyond the years 
boyhood bore on his brow the deep impression
 early thought and premature passion this
was that celebrated lindsay earl crawford
who in his after days was known by the epithet
 the tiger earl and who ruled the great and
rich valley stratford with the absolute
power and unrelenting cruelty a feudal tyrant
two or three gentlemen friends the earl or
 his own countenanced sir john ramorny
by their presence on this occasion the charge
was again stated and met by a broad denial on
the part the accused and in reply the challengers
offered to prove their assertion by an
appeal to the ordeal bierright
i am not bound answered sir john ramorn
 to submit to this ordeal since i can
prove by the evidence my late royal master
that i was in my own lodgings lying on my
bed ill at ease while this provost and these
bailies pretend i was committing a crime to
which i had neither will nor temptation i
can therefore be no just object suspicion
i can aver said the prince that i saw
and conversed with sir john ramorny about
some matters concerning my own household on
the very night when this murder was adoing
i therefore know that he was ill at ease and
could not in person commit the deed in question
but i know nothing the employment
 his attendants and will not take it upon me
to say that some one them may not have been
guilty the crime now charged on them
sir john ramorny had during the beginning
 this speech looked round with an air 
defiance which was somewhat disconcerted by
the concluding sentence rothsay's speech
i thank your highness he said with a smile
for your cautious and limited testimony in my
behalf he was wise who wrote put not your
faith in princes 
if you have no other evidence your innocence
sir john ramorny said the king
 we may not in respect to your followers refuse
to the injured widow and orphans the complainers
the grant a proof by ordeal bierright
unless any them should prefer that 
combat for yourself you are by the prince's
evidence freed from the attaint
my liege answered sir john i can take
warrant upon myself for the innocence my
household and followers
wliy so a monk or a woman might speak
roi n s

said sir patrick charters iii knightly language
wilt thou sir holm de ramorny do battle
with me in the behalf thy followers 
 the provost perth had not obtained time
lo name the word combat said ramorny ere
i would have accepted it but i am not at present
fit to hold a lance
 i am glad it under your favour sir
john there will be the less bloodshed said
the king you must therefore produce your
followers according to your steward's household
 in the great church st john's that in
presence all whom it may concern they may
purge themselves this accusation see that
every man them do appear at the time 
high mass otherwise your honour may be sorely
tainted
they shall attend to a man said sir john
ramcrny then bowing low to the king he
directed himself to the young duke rothsay
and making a deep obeisance spoke so as
to be heard by him alone you have used
me generously my lord one word your
lips could have ended this controversy and you
have refused to speak it 

on my life whispered the prince i
spake as far as the extreme verge truth and
conscience would permit i think thou could'st
not expect i should frame lies for thee and after
all john in my broken recollections that
night i do bethink me a butcherlylooking
mute with a curtalaxe much like such a one
as may have done yonder nightjob ha have
i touched you sir knight 
ramorny made no answer but turned away
as precipitately as if some one had pressed suddenly
on his wounded arm and regained his
lodgings with the earl crawford to whom
though disposed for anything rather than revelry
he was obliged to offer a splendid collation
to acknowledge in some degree his sense the
countenance which the young noble had afforded
him
chapter x
when after an entertainment the prolonging
 which was like torture to the wounded
knight the earl crawford at length took
horse to go to his distant quarters in the castle
 dublin where he resided as a guest the
knight ramorny retired into his sleeping
apartment agonized pains body and anxiety
 mind here he found henbane dwining on
whom it was his hard fate to depend for consolation
in both respects the physician with his
affectation extreme humility hoped he saw
his exalted patient merry and happy
merry as a mad dog said ramorny and
happy as the wretch whom the cur hath bitten
and who begins to feel the approach 
the ravening madness that ruthless boy saw
my agony and spared not a single carouse i
must do him justice forsooth if i had done
justice to him and to the world i had thrown
him out window and cut short a career which
if he grow upas he has begun will prove a source
 misery to all scotland but especially to tayside
 take heed as thou undoes the ligatures
chirurgeon the touch a fly's wing on that
raw glowing stump were like a dagger to me
 fear not my noble patron said the leech
with a chuckling laugh enjoyment which he
vainly endeavoured to disguise under a tone 
affected sensibility we will apply some fresh
balsam and he he he relieve your knightly
honour the irritation which you sustain so
firmly
firmly man said ramorny grinning
with pain i sustain it as i would the scorching
flames purgatory the bone seems made
 redhot iron thy greasy ointment will hiss
as it drops upon the wound and yet it is december's
ice compared to the feverfit my
mind 
i
we will first use our emollients upon the
body my noble patron said dwining and
then with your knighthood's permission your
servant will try his art on the troubled mind
though i fain hope even the mental pain also
may in some degree depend on the irritation 
the wound and that abated as i trust the corporeal
pangs will soon be perhaps the stormy
feelings the mind may subside themselves

henbane dwining said the patient as he
felt the pain his wound assuaged thou art
a precious and invaluable leech but some things
are beyond thy power thou canst stupid my
bodily sense this raging agony but thou
canst not teach me to bear the scorn the boy
whom i have brought up whom i loved dining
 for i did love him dearly love him 
the worst my ill deeds have been done to
flatter his vices and he grudged me a word 
his mouth when a word would have allayed this
cumber he smiled too i saw him smile when
yon paltry provost the companion and patron
 wretched burghers defied me whom this
heartless prince knew to be unable to bear arms
ere i forget or forgive it thou thyself shalt
preach up the pardoning injuries and
then the care for tomorrow tbink'st thou
henbane d wining that in very reality the
wounds the slaughtered corpse will gape and
shed tears fresh blood at the murderer's approach

i cannot tell my lord save by report
said dwining which avouches the fiict
the brute bonthron said ramorny is
startled at the apprehension such a thing and
speaks being rather willing to stand the
combat what think'st thou he is a fellow
 steel
it is the armourer's trade to deal with
steel replied dwining
 were bonthron to fall it would little grieve
me said ramorny though i should miss
an useful hand
i well believe your lordship will not sorrow
as for that you lost last excuse my pleasantry
 he he he but what are the useful
properties this fellow bonthron 
 those a bulldog answered the knight 
he worries without barking
 you have no fear his coiitessiug said
the physician
who can tell what the dread approaching
death may do replied the patient he
has already shown a timorousness entirely alien
from his ordinary sullenness nature he that
would scarce wash his hands after he had slain a
man is now afraid to see a dead body bleed
 well said the leech i must do somewhat
for him if i can since it was to further my
revenge that he struck yonder downright blow
though by ill luck it lighted not where it was
intended
and whose fault was that timid villain
said ramorny save thine own who marked
a rascal deer for a buck the first head 
benedicite noble sir replied the medicine
 would you have me who know little
save chamber practice be as skilful woodcraft
as your noble self or tell hart from hind
doe from roe in a glade at midnight i misdoubted
me little when i saw the figure run
past us to the smith's habitation in the wynd
habited like a morrisdancer and yet my mind
partly misgave me whether it was our man for
methought he seemed less stature but when
he came out again after so much time as to
change his dress and swaggered onwards with
buffcoat and steelcap whistling after the armourer's
wonted fashion i do own i was mistaken
and loosed your knighthood's hulldog
upon him who did his devoir most duly though
he pulled down the wrong deer therefore unless
the accursed smith kills our poor friend
stonedead on the spot i am determined if art
may do it that the bandog bonthron shall not
miscarry
it will put thine art to the test man 
medicine said ramorny for know that having
the worst the combat if our champion
be not killed stonedead in the lists he will be
drawn forth them by the heels and without
further ceremony knitted up to the gallows as
convicted the murder and when he hath
swung there like a loose tassel for an hour or so
i think thou wilt hardly take it in hand to cure
his broken neck
i am a different opinion may it please
your knighthood answered d wining gently
i will carry him off from the civ foot the
swallows
into the land faery like king arthur
or sir huon bordeaux or utero the
dane or will if i please suffer lii to dangle
on the gibbet for a certain number minutes
or hours and then whisk him away from
the sight all with as much ease as the wind
wafts away the withered leaf
this is idle boasting sir leech replied
ramorny the whole mob perth will attend
him to the gallows each more eager than
another to see the retainer a nobleman die for
the slaughter a cuckold citizen there will
be a thousand them round the gibbet's foot
and were there ten thousand said dining
 shall i who am a high clerk and have
studied in spain and araby itself not be able
to deceive the eyes this hoggish herd 
citizens when the pettiest juggler that ever
dealt in legerdemain can gull even the sharp observation
 your most intelligent knighthood 
i tell you i will put the change on them as if i
were in possession eddie's ring
if thou speaks truth answered the
knight and i think thou dearest not palter
with mo on such a theme thou must have tin
said
 satan and i will have nought to do with
him i disown and defy him
dwining indulged in his internal chuckling
laugh when he heard his patron testify his defiance
 the foul fiend and saw him second
it by crossing himself he composed himself
however upon observing ramorny's aspect become
very stern and said with tolerable gravity
though a little interrupted by the effort
necessary to suppress his mirthful mood 
confederacy most devout sir confederacy
is the soul jugglery but he he he i have
not the honour to be he he an ally the
gentleman whom you speak in whose existence
i am he he no very profound believer
though your knightship doubtless hath better
opportunities acquaintance
proceed rascal and without that sneer
which thou mayest otherwise dearly pay for
i will most undaunted replied dwining
know that i have my confederate too else
my skill were little worth
and who may that be pray you 
stephen smotherwcll if it like your boll

your hickman this fair city i marvel
your knighthood knows him not
 and i marvel thy knaveship knows him not
on professional acquaintance replied ramon
 but i see thy nose is unslit thy ears yet
cropped and if thy shoulders are scared or
branded thou art wise for using a highcollared
jerkin
he he your honour is pleasant said the
medicine it is not by personal circumstances
that i have acquired the intimacy 
stephen smotherwell but on account a certain
traffic betwixt us in which ant please you
i exchange certain sums silver for the bodies
heads and limbs those who die by aid 
friend stephen
wretch exclaimed the knight with horror
is it to compose charms and forward
works witchcraft that you trade for these
miserable relics mortality 
he he he no an it please your knightexecutioner
so called because one his dues consisted
in taking a small ladle full scottish lock meal out every
bashful exposed in the market
j
hood answered the medicine much amused
with the ignorance his patron but we who
are knights the scalpel are accustomed to
practise careful carving the limbs defunct
persons which we call dissection whereby we
discover by examination a dead member
how to deal with one belonging to a living
man which hath become diseased through injury
or otherwise ah if your honour saw
my poor laboratory i could show you heads and
hands feet and lungs which have been long supposed
to be rotting in the mould the skull 
wallace stolen from london bridge the heart
 sir simon fraser that never feared man the
lovely skull the fair jean logic oh had i
but had the fortune to have preserved the chivalrous
hand mine honoured patron 
out upon thee slave thickest thou to
disgust me with thy catalogue horrors tell
me at once where thy discourse drives how can
thy traffic with the hangdog executioner be 
avail to serve me or to help my servant bonthrone

nay i do not recommend it to your knighthood
save in an extremity replied dwining
hg

one hazard suppose our mastiff mortally
woimdcd in the lists who shall prevent his
growling out some species confession different
from what we would recommend 
marry that can his medicine said d wining
 let me wait on him and lay but a
finger on his wound and trust me he shall betray
no confidence
a why there's a willing fiend that needs neither
pushing nor prompting said ramorny
as i trust i shall need neither in your
knighthood's service
we will go indoctrinate our agent continued
the knight we shall find him pliant 
for hound as he is he knows those who feed from
those who browbeat him and he holds a late
royal master mine in deep hate for some injurious
treatment and base terms which he received
at his hand i must also farther concert
with thee the particulars thy practice for
saving the bandog from the hands the herd
 citizens
we leave this worthy pair friends to their
secret practices which we shall afterwards seethe
results they were although different
s
qualities as well matched for device and execution
 criminal projects as the greyhound
is to destroy the game which the slowhound
raises or the slowhound to track the prey which
the gazehound discovers by the eye pride and
selfishness were the characteristics both but
from the difference rank education and talents
they had assumed the most different appearance
in the two individuals
nothing could less resemble the highblown
ambition the favourite courtier the successful
gallant and the bold warrior than the
submissive unassuming medicine who seemed
even to court and delight in insult whilst in
his secret soul he felt himself possessed a
superiority knowledge a power both 
science and mind which placed the rude
nobles the day infinitely beneath him so
conscious was henbane d wining this elevation
that like a keeper wild beasts he sometimes
adventured for his own amusement to
rouse the stormy passions such men as ramorn
trusting with his humble manner to
elude the turmoil he had excited as an italian
boy will launch his light canoe secure from
its very fragility upon a broken surf in wliicli
the boat an argosy would be assuredly dashed
to pieces that the feudal baron should despise
the humble practitioner in medicine was
a matter course but ramorny felt not the
less the influence which dwining exercised over
him and was in the encounter their wits often
mastered by him as the most eccentric efforts
 a fiery horse are overcome by a boy 
twelve years old if he has been bred to the arts
 the manege but the contempt dwining for
ramorny was far less qualified he regarded the
knight in comparison with himself as scarcely
rising above the brute creation capable indeed
 working destruction as the bull with his
horns or the wolf with his fangs but mastered
by mean prejudices and a slave to priestcraft
in which phrase dwining included religion
 every kind on the whole he considered
ramorny as one whom nature had assigned to
him as a serf to mine for the gold which he worshipped
and the avaricious love which was
his greatest failing though by no means his
worst vice he vindicated this sordid tenders
 t
cy in bis own eyes by persuading himself but
it had its source in the love power
henbane dwining he said as he gazed
in delight upon the hoards which he had secretly
amassed and which he visited from time to
time is no silly miser that doats on those
pieces for their golden lustre it is the power
with which they endow the possessor which
makes him thus adore them what is there that
these put not within your command do you
love beauty and are mean deformed infirm
and old here is a lure the fairest hawk 
them all will stoop to are you feeble weak
subject to the oppression the powerful here
is that will arm in your defence those more
mighty than the petty tyrant whom you fear
are you splendid in your ashes and desire the
outward show opulence this dark chest
contains many a wide range hill and dale
many a fair forest full game the allegiance
 a thousand vassals wish you for favour in
courts temporal or spiritual the smiles 
kings the pardon popes and priests for old
crimes and the indulgence which encourages
priestridden fools to venture on new ones 
all these holy incentives to vice may be purchased
for gold revenge itself which the
gods are said to reserve to themselves doubtless
because they envy humanity so sweet a
morsel revenge itself is to be bought by it
but it is also to be won by superior skill and
that is the nobler mode reaching it i will
spare then my treasure for other uses and accomplish
my revenge gratis or rather i will add
the luxury augmented wealth to the triumph
 requited wrongs
thus thought dwining as returned from
his visit to sir john ramorny he added the
gold he had received for his various services to
the mass his treasure and having gloated
over the whole for a minute or two turned the
key on his concealed treasurehouse and walked
forth on his visits to his patients yielding
the wall to every man whom he met and bowing
and doffing his bonnet to the poorest burgher
that owned a petty booth nay to the artificers
who gained their precarious bread by the labour
 their walked hands
caitiffs was the thought his heart
while he did such obeisance base soddeii
witted mechanics did you know what this key
could disclose what foul weather from heaven
would prevent your unbonneting what putrid
kennel in your wretched hamlet would
be disgusting enough to make you scruple to
fall down and worship the owner such wealth
but i will make you feel my power though
it suits my humour to hide it i will be an incubus
to your city since you have rejected meas
a magistrate like the nightmare i will
hagride ye yet remain invisible myself this
miserable ramorny too he who in losing his
hand has like a poor artizan lost the only valuable
part his frame he heaps insulting language
on me as if anything which he can salad
powder to chafe a constant mind like mine yet
awhile hexjalls me rogue villain and slave he
acts as wisely as if he should amuse himself by
pulling hairs out my head while my hand
had hold this heartstrings every insult i
ran pay back instantly by a pang bodily
pain or mental agonysand he he i run
no long accounts with his knighthood that mast
be allowed
while the medicine was thus indulging his
diabolical musing and passing in his creeping
manner along the street the cry females was
heard behind him
ay there he is our lady be praised 
there is the most helpful man in perth said
one voice
they may speak knights and kings for
redressing wrongs as they call it but give me
worthy master dwining the potter carrier summers
replied another
at the same moment the leech was surrounded
and taken hold by the speakers good women
 the fair city 
how now what's the matter said dining
 whose cow has calved 
 there is no calving in the case said one 
the women but a poor fatherless wean dying 
so come wa wi you for our trust is constant
in you as bruce said to donald the isles
opiferque per orbem dicor said henbane
dwining what is the child dvin 
the croup the croup screamed one 
the gossips the innocent is rousing like a
corbie
cynanche trachealis that disease makes
brief work show me the house instantly
continued the medicine who was in the habit
 exercising his profession liberally notwithstanding
his natural avarice and humanely in
spite his natural malignity as we can suspect
him no better principle his motive was
probably vanity and the love his art
he would nevertheless have declined giving his
attendance in the present case had he known
whither the kind gossips were conducting him
in time sufficient to frame an apology but ere
he guessed whither he was going the leech was
hurried into the house the late oliver proudfate
from which he heard the chant the
women as they swathed and dressed the corpse
 the umquhile bonnetmaker for the ceremony
 next morning which chant the
following verses may be received as a modern
imitation

viewless essence thin and bare
well nigh melted into air 
still with fondness hovering near
the earthly form thou once didst wear 

pause upon thy pinion's flight
be thy course to left or right 
be thou doom'd to soar or sink
pause upon the awful brink

to avenge the deed expelling
thee untimely from thy dwelling
mystic force thou shalt retain
o'er the blood and o'er the brain

when the form thou shalt espy
that darken'd on thy closing eye 
when the footstep thou shalt hear
that thrill'd upon thy dying ear 

tien strange sympathies shall wake
the flesh shall thrill the nerves shall quake
the wounds renew their clotted flood
and every drop cry blood for blood 
hardened as he was the physician felt re 
luctancc to pass the threshold the man to j
whose death he had been so directly though
so far as the indmdual was concerned mistakingly
accessory
let me pass on women he said my
art can only help the living the dead are pastour
power
nay but your patient is up stain's the
youngest orphan 
dwining was compelled to go into the house
but he was surprised when the instant he
stepped over the threshold the gossips who
were busied with the dead body stinted suddenly
in their song while one said to the others 
in god's name who entered that was a
large gout blood 
not so said another voice it is a drop
 the liquid balm
nay summer it was blood again i say
who entered the house even now 
one looked out from the apartment into the
little entrance where dwining under pretence
 not distinctly seeing the trapladder by which
he was to ascend into the upper part this
house lamentation was delaying his progress
purposely disconcerted with what had reached
him the conversation
nay it is only worthy master henbane
dwining answered one the sibyls
only master dwining replied the one
who had first spoken in a tone acquiescence 
 our best helper in need then it must have
been balm sure enough
nay said the other it may have been
blood nevertheless for the leech look you
when the body was found was commanded by
the magistrates to probe the wound with his instruments
and how could the poor dead corpse
know that that was done with good purpose 
ay truly summer and as poor gossip
oliver often mistook friends for enemies while
he was in life his judgment cannot be thought
to have mended now
dwining heard no more being now forced
up stairs into a species garret where magdalen
sat on her widowed bed clasping to
her bosom her infant which already black in
the face and uttering the gasping crowing
sound which gives the popular name to the
complaint seemed on the point rendering up
its brief existence a dominican monk sat near
the bed holding the other child in his arms and
seeming from time to time to speak a word or
two spiritual consolation or intermingle
some observation on the child's disorder
the medicine cast upon the good father a
single glance filled with that ineffable disdain
which men science entertain against interlopers
his own aid was instant and efficacious 
he snatched the child from the despairing mother
stripped its throat and opened a vein
which as it bled freely relieved the little patient
instantaneously in a brief space every
dangerous symptom disappeared and dwining
having bound up the wound replaced the infant
in the arms the half distracted mother
the poor woman's distress for her husband's
loss which had been suspended during the extremity
 the child's danger now returned on
magdalen with the force an augmented torrent
which has borne down the dam dike that
for a while interrupted its waves
oh learned sir she said you see a poor
woman her that you once knew a richer 
but the hands that restored this bairn to my
arms must not leave this house empty generous
kind master dining accept his beads
they are made ebony and silver he aye
liked to have his things as handsome as any gentleman
 and liker he was in all his ways to a
gentleman than any one us and even so came
 it
with these words in a mute passion grief
she pressed to her breast and to her lips the
chaplet her deceased husband and proceeded
to thrust it into dwining's hands
take it she said for the love one
who loved you well ah he used ever to say
if ever man could be brought back from the
brink the grave it must be by master dining's
guidance and his ain bairn is brought
back this blessed day and he is lying there stark
and stiff and kens nothing its health and
sickness o woe is me and walk wa but
take the beads and think on his pair soul as
you put them through your fingers he will be
fineed from purgatory the sooner that good people
pray to assoilzie him
take back your beads summer i know
ho legerdemain can do no conjuring tricks
said the medicine who more moved than perhaps
his rugged nature had anticipated endeavoured
to avoid receiving the illomened gift
but his last words gave offence to the churchman
whose presence he had not recollected
when he uttered them
how now sir leech said the dominican 
do you call prayers for the dead juggling
tricks i know that chaucer the english
maker says you medicines that your study
is but little on the bible our mother the
church hath nodded late but her eyes are
now opened to discern friends from foes and
be well assured 
nay reverend father said d wining you
take me at too great advantage i said i could
do no miracles and was about to add that as
the church certainly could work such conclusions
those rich beads should be deposited in
your hands to be applied as they may best benefit
the soul the deceased
he dropped the beads into the dominican's
hand and escaped from the house mourn 
ing
this was a strangely timed visit he
said to himself when he got safe out doors
i hold such things cheap as any can yet
though it is but a silly fancy i am glad i saved
the squalling child's life but i must to my
friend smotherwell whom i have no doubt to
bring to my purpose in the matter bonthron 
and thus i shall save two lives and have destroyed
only one
chapter xi
the high church st john's in perth
being that the patron saint the burgh
had been selected by the magistrates as that in
which the community was likely to have most
fair play for the display the ordeal the
churches and convents the dominicans carthusian
and others the regular clergy had
been highly endowed by the king and nobles
and therefore it was the universal cry the
citycouncil that their ain goodauld st john
 whose good graces they thought themselves
sure ought to be fully confided in and preferred
to the new patrons for whom the dominicans
carthusian carmelite and others
had founded newer seats around the fair city
the disputes between the regular and secular
clergy added to the jealousy which dictated this
choice the spot in which heaven was to display
a species miracle upon a direct appeal
to the divine decision in a case doubtful guilt 
and the townclerk was as anxious that the
church st john should be preferred as if
there had been a faction in the body saints for
and against the interests that beautiful town
many therefore were the petty intrigues entered
into and disconcerted for the purpose 
fixing on the church but the magistrates considering
it as a matter touching in a close degree
the honour the city determined with judicious
confidence in the justice and impartiality
 their patron to confide the issue to the influence
 st john
it was therefore after high mass had been
performed with the greatest solemnity which
circumstances rendered the ceremony capable
and after the most repeated and fervent prayers
had been offered to heaven by the crowded assembly
that preparations were made for appealing
to the direct judgment heaven on the
mysterious murder the unfortunate bonnetmaker

the scene presented that effect imposing
solemnity which the rites the catholic church
are so well qualified to produce the eastern
window richly and variously painted streamed
down a torrent chequered light upon the
high altar on the bier placed before it were
stretched the mortal remains the murdered
man his arms folded on his breast and his
palms joined together with the fingers pointed
upwards as if the senseless clay was itself appealing
to heaven for vengeance against those
who had violently divorced the immortal spirit
from its mangled tenement
close to the bier was placed the throne which
supported robert scotland and this brother
albany the prince sat upon a lower stool
beside his father an arrangement which occasioned
some observation as albany's seat being
little distinguished from that the king the
heirapparent though full age seemed to be
degraded beneath his uncle in the sight the
assembled people perth the bier was so
placed as to leave the view the body it sustained
open to the greater part the multitude
assembled in the church
at the head the bier stood the knight kinfauns
the challenger and at the foot the young
earl crawford as representing the defendant
the evidence the duke rothsay in expurgation
as it was termed sir john ramorny
had exempted him from the necessity attendance
as a party subjected to the ordeal and
his illness served as a reason for his remaining
at home his household including those who
though immediately in waiting upon sir john
were accounted the prince's domestics and had
not yet received their dismissal amounted to
eight or ten persons most them esteemed men
 profligate habits and who might therefore
be deemed capable in the riot a festival
vol u

evening committing the slaughter the
bonnetmaker they were drawn up in a row
on the left side the church and wore a species
 white cassock resembling the dress a
penitentiary all eyes being bent on them several
 this band seemed so much disconcerted
as to excite among the spectators strong
prepossessions their guilt the real murderer
had a countenance incapable betraying him
a sullen dark look which neither the feast
nor winecup could enliven and which the peril
 discovery and death could not render dejected
we have already noticed the posture the
dead body the face was bare as were the breast
and arms the rest the corpse was shrouded
in a windingsheet the finest linen so that
if blood should flow from any place which was
covered it could not fail to be instantly manifest
high mass having been performed followed
by a solemn invocation to the deity that he
would be pleased to protect the innocent and
make known the guilty eviot sir john ramorn's
page was summoned to undergo the
ordeal he advanced with an illassured step
perhaps ho thought his internal consciousness
tho
that bonthron must have been the assassin
might be sufficient to implicate him in the murder
though he was not directly accessary to it
he paused before the bier and his voice faltered
as he swore by all that was created in
seven days and seven nights by heaven by
hell by his part paradise and by the god
and author all that he was free and sackless
 the bloody deed done upon the corpse
before which he stood and on whose breast he
made the sign the cross in evidence the appeal
no consequences ensued the body remained
stiff as before the curdled wounds gave
no sign blood
the citizens looked on each other with faces
 blank disappointment they had persuaded
themselves eviot's guilt and their suspicions
had been confirmed by his irresolute manner
their surprise at his escape was therefore
extreme the other followers ramorny took
heart and advanced to take the oath with a
boldness which increased as one by one they
performed the ordeal and were declared by the
voice the judges free and innocent every
suspicion attaching to them on account the
death oliver proudfute
but there was one individual who did not
partake that increasing confidence the name
 bonthron bonthron sounded three times
through the aisles the church but he who
owned it acknowledged the call no otherwise
than by a sort shuffling motion with his feet
as if he had been suddenly affected with a fit 
the palsy
speak dog whispered eviot or prepare
for a dog's death 
but the murderer's brain was so much disturbed
by the sight before him that the judges
beholding his deportment doubted whether to
ordain him to be dragged before the bier or to
pronounce judgment in default and it was not
until he was asked for the last time whether
he would submit to the ordeal that he answered
with his usual brevity 
i will not what do i know what juggling
tricks may be practised to take a poor man's
life i offer the combat to any man who says i
harmed that dead body
and according to usual form he threw his
glove upon the floor the church
henry smith stepped forward amidst the murmured
applause his fellowcitizens which
even the august presence could not entirely suppress
 and lifting the ruffian's glove which he
placed in his bonnet laid down his own in the
usual form as a gage battle but bonthron
raised it not
he is no match for me growled the savage
 nor fit to lift my glove i follow the
prince scotland in attending on his master
 horse this fellow is a wretched mechanic
here the prince interrupted him thou follow
me caitiff i discharge thee from my service
on the spot take him in hand smith and
beat himas thou didst never thump anvil the
villain is both guilty and recreant it sickens
me even to look at him and if my royal father
will be ruled by me he will give the parties
two handsome scottish axes and we will see

which them turns out the best fellow before
the day is half an hour older
this was readily assented to by the earl 
crawford and sir patrick charteris the godfathers
 the parties who as the combatants
were men inferior rank agreed that they
should fight in steel caps buff jackets and with
axes and that as soon as they could be prepared
for the combat
the lists were appointed in the skinners
yards a neighbouring space ground occupied
by the corporation from which it had the
name and who quickly cleared a space about
thirty feet by twentyfive for the combatants
thither thronged the nobles priests and commons
 all excepting the old king who detesting
such scenes blood retired to his residence and
devolved the charge the field upon the earl
 errol lord high constable to whose office
it more particularly belonged the duke albany
watched the whole proceeding vith a close
and wary eye his nephew gave the scene the
heedless degree notice which corresponded
vith his character
rill
when the combatants appeared in the lists
nothing could be more striking than the contrast
betwixt the manly cheerful countenance
 the smith whose sparkling bright eye seemed
already beaming with the victory he hoped
for and the sullen downcast aspect the brutal
bonthron who looked as if he were some
obscene bird driven into sunshine out the
shelter its darksome haunts they made
hath severally each to the truth his quarrel 
a ceremony which henry gow performed with
serene and manly confidence bonthron with a
dogged resolution which induced the duke 
rothsay to say to the high constable didst
thou ever my dear errol behold such a mixture
 malignity cruelty and i think fear as in that
fellow's countenance 
 he is not comely said the earl but n
powerful knave as i have seen
i'll gage a hogshead wine with you my
good lord that he loses the day henry the
armourer is as strong as he and much more
active and then look at his bold bearing 
there is something in that other fellow that ih
loathsome to look upon let them yoke presently
my dear constable for i am sick beholding
him
the highconstable then addressed the widow
who in her deep weeds and having her
children still beside her occupied a chair within
the lists woman do you willingly accept
 this man henry the smith to do battle
as your champion in this cause 
i do i do most willingly answered magdalen
proudfute and may the blessing god
and st john give him strength and fortune
since he strikes for the orphan and fatherless 
then i pronounce this a fenced field battle
said the constable aloud let no one
dare upon peril his life to interrupt this
combat by word speech or look sound trumpets
and fight combatants 
the trumpets flourished and the combatants
advancing from the opposite the lists
with a steady and even pace looked at each
other attentively well skilled in judging from
the motion the eye the direction in which
a blow was meditated they halted opposite
to and within reach each other and in turn
made more than one feint to strike in order to
ascertain the activity and vigilance the opponent
at length whether weary these manoeuvres
or fearing lest in a contest so conducted
his unwieldy strength would be foiled by the
activity the smith bonthron heaved up his
axe for a downright blow adding the whole
strength his sturdy arms to the weight the
weapon in its descent the smith however
avoided the stroke by stepping aside for it was
too forcible to be controlled by any guard which
he could have interposed ere bonthron recovered
guard henry struck him a sideling blow
on the steel headpiece which prostrated him
on the ground
 confess or die said the victor placing his
foot on the body the vanquished and holding
to his throat the point the axe which terminated
in a spike or poniard
i will confess said the villain glaring
wildly upward on the sky let me rise
 not till you have yielded said harry
smith
i do yield again murmured southron
and henry proclaimed aloud that his antagonist
was defeated
the dukes rothsay and albany the high
constable and the dominican prior now entered
the lists and addressing bonthron demanded
if he acknowledged himself vanquished
i do answered the miscreant
 and guilty the murder oliver proudfate

i am but i mistook him for another
 and whom didst thou intend to slay 
said the prior confess my son and merit
thy pardon in another world for with this thou
hast little more to do
i took the slain man answered the discomfited
combatant for him whose hand has
struck me down whose foot now presses me
 blessed be the saints said the prior 
 now all those who doubt the virtue the
holy ordeal may have their eyes opened to their
error lo he is trapped in the snare which he
laid for the guiltless
s
 i scarce ever saw the man before said
the smith i never did wrong to him or his
ask him an it please your reverence why
he should have thought slaying me treacherously

it is a fitting question answered the
prior give glory where it is due my son
even though it is manifested by thy shame for
what reason would'st thou have waylaid this
armourer who says he never wronged thee 
 he had wronged him whom i served answered
bonthron and i meditated the deed
by his command
by whose command asked the prior
bonthron was silent for an instant then
growled out he is too mighty for me to
name
 hearken my son said the churchman 
tarry but a brief hour and the mighty and the
mean this earth shall to thee alike be empty
sounds the sledge is even now preparing to
drag thee to the place execution therefore
son once more i charge thee to consult thy
soups weal by glorifying heaven and speaking
the truth was it thy master sir john 
that stirred thee to so foul a deed 
no answered the prostrate villain it
was a gieater than he and at the same time
he pointed with his finger to the prince
wretch said the astonished duke 
rothsay do you dare to hint that was your
instigator 
you yourself my lord answered the unblushing
ruffian
 die in thy falsehood accursed slave 
said the prince and drawing his sword he
would have pierced his calumniator had not
the lord high constable interposed with word
and action
your grace must forgive my discharging
mine office this caitiff must be delivered into
the hands the executioner he is unfit to
be dealt with by any other much less by your
highness
what noble earl said albany aloud and
with much real or affected emotion would
you let the dog pass alive from hence to poison
the people's ears with false accusations
against the prince scotland i say cut him
to hammocks upon the spot 
your highness will pardon me said the
earl errol i must protect him till his
doom is executed
then let him he gagged instantly said
albany and you my royal nephew why
stand you there fixed in astonishment call
your resolution up speak to the prisoner 
swear protest by all that is sacred that you
knew not this felon deed see how the people
look on each other and whisper apart my
life on't that this lie spreads faster than any
gospel truth speak to them royal kinsman
no matter what you say so you be constant in
denial
what sir said rothsay starting from his
pause surprise and mortification and turning
haughtily towards his uncle would you
have me gage my royal word against that an
abject recreant let those who can believe the
son their sovereign the descendant bruce
capable laying ambush for the life a poor
mechanic enjoy the pleasure thinking the
villains tale true
that will not i for one said the smith
bluntly i never did aught but what was in
honour toward his royal grace the duke 
roth say and never received unkindness from
him in word look or deed and i cannot think
he would have given aim to such base practice
was it in honour that you threw his highness
from the ladder in curfew street upon
fastens even said bonthron or think you
the favour was received kindly or unkindly
this was so boldly said and seemed so plausible
that it shook the smith's opinion the
prince's innocence
alas my lord said he looking sorrowfully
towards rothsay could your highness
seek an innocent fellow's life for doing his duty
by a helpless maiden i would rather have
died in these lists than live to hear it said the
bruce's heir 
thou art a good fellow smith said the
prince but i cannot expect thee to judge
more wisely than others away with that convict
to the gallows and gibbet him alive an you
will that he may speak falsehood and spread
scandal on us to the last prolonged moment 
his existence 
so sang the prince turned away from the
lists disdaining to notice the gloomy looks
cast towards him as the crowd made slow and
reluctant way for him to pass and expressing
neither suiprise nor displeasure at a deep hollow
murmur or groan which accompanied
his retreat only a few his own immediate
followers attended him from the field
though various persons distinction had come
there in his train even the lower class 
citizens ceased to follow the unhappy prince
whose former indifferent reputation had exposed
him to so many charges impropriety and
levity and around whom there seemed now
darkening suspicions the most atrocious nature

he took his slow and thoughtful way to the
church the dominicans but the ill news
which fly proverbially fast had reached his father's
place retirement before he himself appeared
on entering the palace and inquiring for
the king the duke rothsay was surprised to
be informed that he was in deep consultation
with the duke albany who mounting on
horseback as the prince left the lists had reached
the convent before him he was about to
use the privilege his rank and birth to enter
the royal apartment when maclewis the commander
 the guard brandanes gave him to
understand in the most respectful terms that
he had special instructions which forbade his
admittance
go at least maclewis and let them know
that i wait their pleasure said the prince
if my uncle desires to have the credit shutting
the father's apartment against the son it
will gratify him to know that i am attending
in the outer hall like a lackey
may it please you said maclewis with
hesitation if your highness would consent
to retire just now and to wait a while in patience
i will send to acquaint you when the
duke albany goes and i doubt not that his
majesty will then admit your grace to his prc
sn
sence at present your highness must forgive
me it is impossible you can have access
i understand you maclewis but go nevertheless
and obey my commands
the officer rent accordingly and returned
with a message that the king was indisposed
and on the point retiring to his private chamber
 but that the duke albany would presently
wait upon the prince scotland
it was however a full half hour ere the
duke albany appeared a period time
which rothsay spent partly in moody silence
and partly in idle talk with maclewis and the
brandanes as the levity or irritability his
temper obtained the ascendant
at length the duke came and with him the
lord high constable whose countenance expressed
much sorrow and embarrassment
fair kinsman said the duke albany
i grieve to say that it is my royal brother's
opinion that it will be best for the honour 
the royal family that your royal highness do
restrict yourself for a time to the seclusion 
the high constable's lodgings and accept 
vol x
the noble earl here present for your principal
if not sole companion until the scandals which
have been this day spread abroad shall be refuted
or forgotten
 how is this my lord errol said the
prince in astonishment is your house to be
my jail and is your lordship to be my jailor

 the saints forbid my lord said the earl
 errol but it is my unhappy duty to obey
the commands your father by considering
your royal highness for some time as being
under my ward
 the prince the heir scotland under the
ward the high constable what reason can
be given for this is the blighting speech a
convicted recreant strength sufficient to tarnish
my royal escutcheon 
while such accusations are not refuted and
denied my kinsman said the duke albany
they will contaminate that a monarch
denied my lord exclaimed the prince 
by whom are they asserted save by a wretch
too infamous even by his own confession to be
credited for a moment though a beggar's character
not a prince's were impeached fetch
him hither let the rack be shown to him you
will soon hear him retract the calumny which
he dared to assert
the gibbet has done its work too surely to
leave bonthron sensible to the rack said the
duke albany he has been executed an
hour since
and why such haste my lord said the
prince know you it looks as if there were
practice in it to bring a stain on my name 
 the custom is universal the defeated combatant
in the ordeal battle is instantly transferred
from the lists to the gallows and yet
fair kinsman continued the duke albany
if you had boldly and strongly denied the imputation
i would have judged right to keep the
wretch alive for further investigation but as
your highness was silent i deemed it best to
stifle the scandal in the breath him that uttered
it
saint mary my lord but this is too insulting
 do yon my uncle and kinsman suppose
me guilty prompting such an useless and
unworthy action as that which the slave confessed

it is not for me to bandy questions with your
highness otherwise i would ask whether you
also mean to deny the scarce less unworthy
though less bloody attack upon the house in
couvrefew street be not angry with me
kinsman but indeed your sequestering yourself
for some brief space from the court were
it only during the king's residence in this city
where so much offence has been given is imperiously
demanded
rothsay paused when he heard this exhortation
 and looking at the duke in a very marked
manner replied 
uncle you are a good huntsman you
have pitched your toils with much skill but you
would have been foiled notwithstanding had
not the stag rushed among the nets free will
god speed you and may you have the profit
by this matter which your measures deserve
say to my father i obey his arrest my lord
high constable wait only your pleasure to
attend you to your lodgings since i am to lie
in ward i could not have desired a kinder or
more courteous warden
the interview between the uncle and nephew
being thus concluded the prince retired
with the earl errol to his lodgings the
citizens whom they met in the streets passing
to the further side when they observed the
duke rothsay to escape the necessity saluting
one whom they had been taught to consider
as a ferocious as well as unprincipled libertine
the constable's lodgings received the
owner and his princely guest both glad to leave
the streets yet neither feeling easy in the situation
which they occupied with regard to each
other within doors
we must return to the lists after the combat
had ceased and when the nobles had withdrawn
the crowds were now separated into
two distinct bodies that which made the smallest
in number was at the same time the most
distinguished for respectability consisting 
the better class inhabitants perth who
were gi'atulating the successful champion and
each other upon the triumphant conclusion
to which they had brought their feud with the
courtiers the magistrates were so much elated
on the occasion that they entreated sir patrick
characterises acceptance a collation in the
townhall to this henry the hero the day
was course invited or he was rather commanded
to attend he listened to the summons
with great embarrassment for it may be readily
believed his heart was with catharine glover
but the advice simon glover decided him
that veteran citizen had a natural and becoming
deference for the magistracy the fair city
and a high estimation all honours which
flowed from such a source
thou must not think to absent thyself from
such a solemn occasion son henry was his
advice sir patrick charteris is to be there
himself and i think it will be a rare occasion
for thee to gain his goodwill it is like he
may order thee a new suit harness and i
myself heard worthy bailie craigdallie say
there was a talk furbishing up the city's armory
 thou must not neglect the good trade
now that thou takes on thee an expensive family

tush father glover answered the embarrassed
victor i lack no custom and thou
knowest there is catharine who may wonder at
my absence and have her ear abused once more
by tales gleemaidens and i wot not what
fear not for that said the glover but
go like an obedient burgess where thy betters
desire to have thee i do not deny that it will cost
some trouble to make thy peace with catharine
about this duel for she thinks herself wiser in
such matters than king and council kirk and
canons provost and bailies but i will take
up the quarrel with her myself and will so
work for thee that though she may receive
thee tomorrow with somewhat a chiding
it shall melt into tears and smiles like an april
morning that begins with a mild shower
away with thee then my son and be constant
tomorrow after morning mass
the smith though reluctantly was obliged
to defer to the reasoning his proposed fatherinlaw
 and once determined to accept the 

your destined for him by the fathers the city
he extricated himself from the crowd and hastened
home to put on his best apparel in which
he presently afterwards repaired to the councillors
where the ponderous oak table seemed
to bend under the massy dishes choice
tay salmon and delicious sea fish from dundee
being the dainties which the fasting season
permitted whilst neither wine ale nor
metheglin were wanting to wash them down
the waits or minstrels the burgh played
during the repast and in the intervals the
music one them recited with great emphasis
a ions poetical account the battle 
fought by sir william wallace and
his redoubled captain and friend thomas 
montreville against the english general seward
 a theme perfectly familiar to all the
guests who nevertheless more tolerant that
their descendants listened as if it had all the
zest novelty it was complimentary to the
ancestor the knight kinfauns doubtless
and to other derbyshire families in passages
which the audience applauded vociferously
whilst they pledged each other in mighty
draughts to the memory the heroes who had
fought hy the side the champion scotland
the health henry wynd was quaffed with
repeated shouts and the provost announced
publicly that the magistrates were consulting
how they might best invest him with some distinguished
privilege or honorary reward to
show how highly his fellowcitizens valued his
courageous exertions
nay take it not thus an it like your worships
said the smith vixh his usual blunt
manner lest men say that valour must be rare
in perth when they reward a man for fighting
for the right a forlorn widow i am sure
there are many scores stout burghers in
perth would have done this day's argue as
well or better than i for in good sooth i
ought to have cracked yonder headpiece like
an earthen pipkin ay and would have done it
too if it had not been one which i myself tempered
for sir john ramorny but an the fair
city think rav service any worth i will
conceive it i'ar more than acquitted by any
aid which you may afford from the common
good to the support the widow magdalen
and her poor orphans
that may well be done said sir patrick
charteris and yet leave the fair city rich
enough to pay her debts to henry wynd 
which every man us is a better judge than
himself who is blinded with an unavailing nicety
which men call modesty and if the burgh
be too poor for this the provost will bear his
share the rover's golden angels have not all
taken flight yet
the beakers were now circulated under the
name a cup comfort to the widow and
anon flowed around once more to the happy
memory the murdered oliver now so bravely
avenged in short it was a feast so jovial
that all agreed nothing was wanting to render
it perfect but the presence the bonnetmate
public proper the burgh
ker himself whose calamity had occasioned the
meeting and who had usually furnished the
standing jest at such festive assemblies had
his attendance been possible it was drily observed
by bailie craigdallie he would certainly
have claimed the success the day and vouched
himself the avenger his own murder
at the sound the vesper bell the company
broke up some the graver sort going to evening
prayers where with halfshut eyes and shining
countenances they made a most orthodox
and edifying portion a lenten congregation 
others to their own homes to tell over the occurrences
 the fight and feast for the information
 the family circle and some doubtless
to the licensed freedoms some tavern the
door which lent did not keep so close shut
as the forms the church required henry
returned to the wynd warm with the good wine
and the applause his fellowcitizens and fell
asleep to dream perfect happiness and catharine
glover
we have said that when the combat was decided
the spectators were divided into two bodies
 these when the more respectable portion
attended the victor in joyous procession
much the greater number or what might be
termed the rabble waited upon the subdued
and sentenced bonthron who was travelling ina
different direction and for a very opposite
purpose whatever may be thought the comparative
attractions the house mourning
and feasting under other circumstances there
can be little doubt which will draw most visitors
when the question is whether we would
witness miseries which we are not to share or
festivities which we are not to partake accordingly
the tumbril in which the criminal
was conveyed to execution was attended by far
the greater proportion the inhabitants 
perth
a friar was seated in the same car with the
murderer to whom he did not hesitate to communicate
under the seal confession the
same false asseveration which he had made upon
the place combat which charged the duke
 rothsay with being director the ambuscade
by which the unfortunate bonnetmaker
bad suffered the same falsehood he disseminated
among the crowd averring with unblushing
effrontery to those who were nighest
to the car that he owed his death to his having
been willing to execute the duke rothsay's
pleasure for a time he repeated these words
sullenly and doggedly in the manner one
reciting a task or a liar who endeavours by reiteration
to obtain a credit for his words which
he is internally sensible they do not deserve
but when he lifted up his eyes and beheld in
the distance the black outline a gallows at
least forty feet high with its ladder and its
fatal cord rising against the horizon he became
suddenly silent and the friar could observe that
he trembled very much
be comforted my son said the good
priest you have confessed the truth and received
absolution your penitence will be accepted
according to your sincerity and though
you have been a man bloody hands and cruel
heart yet by the church's prayers you shall
be in due time assailed from the penal fires
 purgatory
these assurances were calculated rather to
augment than to diminish the terrors the culprit
who was agitated by doubts whether the
mode suggested for his preservation from death
would to a certainty be effectual and some suspicion
whether there was really any purpose 
employing them in his favour for he knew his
master well enough to be aware the indifference
with which he would sacrifice one who
might on some future occasion be a dangerous
evidence against him
his doom however was sealed and there
was no escaping from it they slowly approached
the fatal tree which was erected on a
bank by the river's side about half a mile from
the walls the city a site chosen that the body
 the wretch which was to remain food for the
carrion crows might be seen from a distance in
every direction here the priest delivered bonthrone
to the executioner by whom he was assisted
up the ladder and to all appearance dispatched
according to the usual forms the law he
seemed to struggle for life for a minute but soon
fi
after hung still and inanimate the executioner
after remaining upon duty for more than
half an hour as if to permit the last spark 
life to be extinguished announced to the admirers
 such spectacles that the irons for the
permanent suspension the carcass not having
been got ready the concluding ceremony disembowelling
the dead body and attaching it
finally to the gibbet would be deferred till the
next morning at sunrise
notwithstanding the early hour which he had
named master smotherwell had a reasonable
attendance rabble at the place execution
to see the final proceedings justice with its
victim but great was the astonishment and
resentment these amateurs to find that the
dead body had been removed from the gibbet
they were not however long at a loss to guess
the cause its disappearance bonthron had
been the follower a baron whose estates lay in
fife and was himself a native that province
what was more natural than that some the
fife men whose boats were frequently plying
s
on the river should have clandestinely removed
the body their countryman from the place 
public shame the crowd vented their rage
against smotherwell for not completing his job
on the preceding evening and had not he and
his assistant betaken themselves to a boat and
escaped across the tay they would have run
some risk being pelted to death the event
however was too much in the spirit the times
to be much wondered at its real cause we shall

youth i thou dearest to manhood now
darker lip and darker brow
statelier step more pensive mien
in thy face and gait are seen 
thou must now brook midnight watches
take thy food and sport by snatches 
for the gambol and the jest
thou wert wont to love the best
graver follies must thou follow
but as senseless false and hollow
life a poem
young roland gkme now trotted
gaily forward in the train sir halbert glen
dinning he was relieved from his most
galling apprehension the encounter 
the scorn and taunt which might possibly
 the abbot
hail his immediate return to the castle 
avenel there will be a change ere they
see me again he thought to himself i shall
wear the coat plate instead the buff
jerkin and the steel morion for the bonnet
and feather they will be bold that may
venture to break a gibe on the manalarms
for the follies the page and i trust that
ere we return i shall have done something
more worthy note than hallooing a hound
after a deer or scrambling a crag for a kite's
nest he could not indeed help marvelling
that his grandmother with all her religious
prejudices leaning it would seem to
the other side had consented so readily to
his reentering the service the house 
avenel and yet more at the mysterious
joy withvhich she took leave him at the
abbey
 heaven said the dame as she kissed
her young relation and bade him farewell
 works its oyn work even by the hands
 those our enemies who think themselves
the strongest and the wisest thou
the abbot 
my child be ready to act upon the call 
thy religion and country and remember
each earthly bond which thou canst form is
compared to the ties which bind thee to
them like the loose flax to the twisted cable
thou hast not forget the face or form
 the damsel catherine seyton 
roland would have replied in the negative
but the word seemed to stick in his
throat and magdalen continued her exhortations

 thou must not forget her my son and
here i entrust thee with a token which i
trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity
 delivering with care and secrecy into
her own hand
she put here into roland's hand a very
small packet which she again enjoined
him to take the strictest care and to suffer
it to be seen by no one save catherine
seyton who she again unnecessarily reminded
him was the young maiden he had
met on the preceding day she then bec
the abbot
stowed on him her solemn benediction and
bade god speed him
there was something in her manner and
her conduct which implied mystery but
roland graeme was not an age or temper
to waste much time in endeavouring to
decipher her meaning all that was obvious
to his perception in the present journey
promised pleasure and novelty he
rejoiced that he was travelling towards
edinburgh in order to assume the character
 a man and lay aside that a boy he
was delighted to think that he would have
an opportunity rejoiningcatherinesey ton
whose bright eyes and lively manners had
made so favourable an impression on his
imagination and as an inexperienced yet
highspirited youth entering for the first
time upon active life his heart bounded at
the thought that he was about to see all
those scenes courtly splendour and warlike
adventures which the followers 
sir halbert used to boast on their occa
the abbot 
signal visits to avenel to the wonderment
and envy those who like roland knew
courts and camps only by hearsay and
were condemned to the solitary sports and
almost monastic seclusion avenel surrounded
by its lonely lake and embosomed
among its pathless mountains they shall
mention my name he said to himself if
the risk my life can purchase me opportunities
 distinction and catherine seyton's
saucy eye shall rest with more respect
on the distinguished soldier than that with
which she laughed to scorn the raw and inexperienced
page there was wanting but
one accessary to complete the sense rapturous
excitation and he possessed it by
being once more mounted on the back 
a fiery and active horse instead plodding
along on foot as had been the case during
the preceding days
impelled by the liveliness his own spirits
which so many circumstances tended
naturally to exalt roland graeme's voice
and his laughter were soon distinguished
b the abbot
amid the trampling the horses the retinue
and more than once attracted the attention
 their leader who remarked with
satisfaction that the youth replied with
goodhumoured raillery to such the train
as jested with him on his dismissal and return
to the service the house avenel
 i thought the holly branch in your
bonnet had been blighted master roland
said one the menatarms
 only pinched with half an hour's frost 
you see it flourishes as green as ever
 it is too grave a plant to flourish on so
hot a soil as that headpiece thine master
roland gramme retorted the other
who was an old equerry sir halbert
glendinning
 if it will not flourish alone said roland
 i will mix it with the laurel and the
myrtle and i will carry them so near the
sky that it shall make amends for their
stinted growth 
thus speaking he dashed his spurs into
his horse's sides and checking him at the
same time compelled him to execute a lofty
the abbot 
caracole sir halbert glendinning looked
at the demeanour his new attendant with
that sort melancholy pleasure with which
those who have long followed the pursuits
 life and are sensible their vanity regard
the gay young and buoyant spirits
to whom life as yet is only hope and promise

in the meanwhile adam woodcock the
falconer stripped his pasquin habit and
attired according to his rank and calling
in a green jerkin with a bag on the one
side and a short hanger on the other a
glove on his left hand which reached half
vay up his arm and a bonnet and feather
upon his head came after the party as fast
as his active little gallowaynag could trot
and immediately entered into parley with
roland graeme
 so my youngster you are once more
under shadow the holly branch 
c and in case to repay you my good
friend answered roland your ten groats
 silver
a 
 the abbot
 which but an hour since said the
falconer you had nearly paid me with
ten inches steel on my faith it is written
in the our destiny that i must
brook your dagger after all
 nay speak not that my good
friend said the youth i would rather
have broached my own bosom than yours 
but who could have known you in the mumming
dress you wore 
yes the falconer resumed for both
as a poet and actor he had his own professional
share selfconceit i think i was
as good an howleglas as ever played part
at a shrovetide revelry and not a much
worse abbot unreason i defy the old
enemy to unmask me when i chuse to keep
my vizard on what the devil brought the
knight on us before we had the game out
you would have heard me hollo my own
new ballad with a voice should have reached
to berwick but i pray you master
roland be less free cold steel on slight
occasions j for but for the stuffing my
the abbot 
reverend doublet i had only left the kirk
to take my place in the kirkyard
nay spare me that feud said roland
graeme we shall have no time to fight
it out for by our lord's command i am
bound for edinburgh
i know it said adam woodcock
and even therefore we shall have time ta
solder up this rent by the way for sir albert
has appointed me your companion and
guide
ay and with what purpose said
the page
that said the falconer is a question
i cannot answer but i know that bethe
food the ey asses washed or unwashed
and indeed whatsoever becomes 
perch and mew i am to go with you to
edinburgh and see you safely delivered to
the regent at holyrood
 how to the regent said roland in
surprise
 ay by my faith to the regent replied
woodcock j i promise you that if
 the abbot
you are not to enter his service at least
you are to wait upon him in the character
 a retainer our knight avenel
 i know no right said the youth
 which the knight avenel hath to
transfer my service supposing that i owe
it to himself
hush hush said the falconer that
is a question i advise no one to stir in until
he has the mountain or the lake or the
march another kingdom which is better
than either betwixt him and his feudal superior

 but sir halbert glendinning said the
youth is not my feudal superior nor has
he aught authority 
 i pray you my son to rein your
tongue answered adam woodcock my
lord's displeasure if you provoke it will be
worse to appease than my lady's the
touch his least finger were heavier than
her hardest blow and by my faith he is
a man steel as true and as pure but as
hard and as pitiless you remember the
the abbot t
cock capellae whom he hanged over
his gate for a mere mistake a poor yoke
 oxen taken in scotland when he thought
he was taking them in english land i loved
the cock capperlaw the kerr had not
an honest man in their clan and they
have had men that might have been a pattern
to the border men that would not
have lifted under twenty cows at once and
would have held themselves dishonoured if
they had taken a drift sheep or the like
but always managed their raids in full credit
and honour but see his worship halts
and we are close by the bridge ride up
ride up we must have his last instructions

it was as adam woodcock said in the
hollow way descending towards the bridge
which was still in the guardianship peter
bridge ward as he was called though he
was now very old sir halbert glendinning
halted his retinue and beckoned to woodcock
and greene to advance to the head
 the train
 the abbot
 woodcock said he thou knowest
to whom thou art to conduct this youth
and thou young man obey discreetly and
with diligence the orders that shall be
given thee curb thy vain and peevish
temper be just true and faithful and
there is in thee that which may raise thee
many a degree above thy present station
neither shalt thou always supposing thine
efforts to be fair and honest want the protection
and countenance avenel
leaving them in front the bridge
whose centre tower now began to cast a
prolonged shade upon the river the knight
 avenel turned to the left without crossing
the river and pursued his way towards
the chain hills within whose recesses are
situated the lake and castle avenel
there remained behind the falconer roland
graeme and a domestic the knight
 inferior rank who was left with them to
look after their horses while on the road
to carry their baggage and to attend to
their convenience
the abbot 
so soon as the more numerous body 
riders had turned off to pursue their journey
westward those whose route lay across
the river and was directed towards the
north summoned the bridgeward and demanded
a free passage
i will not lower the bridge answered
peter in a voice querulous with age and
illhumour come papist come protestant
ye are all the same the papist threatened
us with purgatory and fleeced us
with pardons the protestant mints at us
with the sword and cuttle us with the liberty
 conscience but the never a one 
either says peter there is your penny i
am well tired all this and for no man
shall the bridge fall that pays me not ready
money and i would have you inow i care
as little for geneva as for rome as little
for homilies as for pardons and the silver
pennies are the only passports i will hear

 here is a proper old chuff said 
title abbot
cock to his companion then raising his
voice he exclaimed hark thee dog 
bridgeward villain doest thou think we
have refused peter's pence to rome to pay
thine at the bridge kennaquhair let
thy bridge down instantly to the followers
 the house avenel or by the hand 
my father and that handled many a bridle
rein for he was a bluff yorkshireman i
say by my father's hand our knight will
blow thee out thy solangoose's nest therein
the middle the water with the light
falconet which we are bringing southward
from edinburgh tomorrow
the bridgeward heard and muttered
 a plague on falcon and falconet on cannon
and demicannon and all the barking
bulldogs whom they halloo against stone
and lime in these our days it was a merry
time when there was little besides handy
blows and it may be a flight arrows
that harmed an ashley wall as little as so
many hailstones but we must jowl and
the abbot it
let the jaw gang by comforting him
self in his state diminished consequence
with this pithy old proverb peter bridgeward
lowered the drawbridge and permitted
them to pass over at the sight his
white hair albeit it discovered a visage
equally peevish through age and misfortune
roland was inclined to give him an alms
but adam woodcock withheld him e'en
let him pay the penalty his former churlishness
and greed he said j the wolf
when he has lost his teeth should be treated
no better than a cur
leaving the bridgeward to lament the
alteration times which sent domineering
soldiers and feudal retainers to his place 
passage instead peaceful pilgrims and
reduced him to become the oppressed instead
 playing the extortioner the travellers
turned them northward and adam
woodcock well acquainted with that part
 the country proposed to cut short a
considerable portion the road by travers
the abbot
sing the little vale glendearg so famous
for the adventures which befel therein during
the earlier part the benedictine's
manuscript with these and with the thousand
commentaries representations and
misrepresentations to which they had given
rise roland graeme was course well
acquainted for in the castle avenel as
well as in other great establishments the
inmates talked nothing so often or with
such pleasure as the private affairs 
their lord and lady but while roland was
viewing with interest these haunted scenes
in which things were said to have passed
beyond the ordinary laws nature adam
woodcock was still regretting in his secret
soul the unfinished revel and the unsung
ballad and kept every now and then breaking
out with some such verses as these 
 the friars fail drank berrybrown ale
the best that ere was tasted 
the monks morose made gude kale
on fridays when they fasted
the abbot 
saint romance sister
the grey priest kist her 
fiend save the company 
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
by my hand friend woodcock said
the page though i know you for a hardy
gospeller that fear neither saint nor devil
yet if i were you i would not sing your
profane songs in this valley glendearg
considering what has happened here before
our time
a straw for your wandering spirits
said adam woodcock i mind them no
more than an earn cares for a string 
wild geese they have all fled since the
pulpits were filled with honest men and the
people's ears with sound doctrine nay i
have a touch at them in my ballad an i
had but had the good luck to have it sung
to j and again he set off in the same
key
from haunted spring and grassy rings
troop goblin elf and fairy 
 the abbot
and the kelpie must flit from the black bogpits
and the brownie must not tarry 
to limbolake
their way they take
with scarce the pith to flee
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
i think he added that could sir albert's
patience have stretched till we came
that length he would have had a hearty
laugh and that is what he seldom enjoys
 if it be all true that men tell his early
life said roland he has less right to
laugh at goblins than most men
 ay i it be all true answered adam
woodcock but who can insure us 
that moreover these were but tales the
monks used to gull us simple laymen withal
 they knew that fairies and hobgoblins
brought aves and paternosters into repute 
but now we have given up worship images
in wood and stone methinks were no
time to be afraid bubbles in the water or
shadows in the air
the abbot 
 but said roland graeme as the catholics
say they do not worship wood or
stone but only as emblems the holy
saints and not as things holy in themselves

 pshaw pshaw answered the falconer
 a rush for their prating they told
us another story when these baptized idols
 theirs brought pikestaves and sandalled
shoon from all the four winds and chilled
the old women out their corn and
their candleends and their butter bacon
wool and cheese and when not so much
as a grey groat escaped tithing
roland graeme had been long taught by
necessity to consider his form religion asa
profound secret and to say nothing whatsoever
in its defence when assailed lest he
should draw on himself the suspicion belonging
to the unpopular and exploded
church he therefore suffered adam woodcock
to triumph without farther opposition
marvelling in his own mind whether any 
the goblins formerly such active agents
 the abbot
would avenge his rude raillery before they
left the valley glendearg but no such
consequences followed they passed the
night quietly in a cottage in the glen and
the next day resumed their route to edinburgh

the abbot s
chapter 
ediiia scotia's darling seat
all hail thy palaces and towers
where once beneath a monarch's feet
sate legislation's sovereign powers
bucks
this then is edinburgh said the
youth as the fellowtravellers arrived at one
 the heights to the southward which commanded
a view the great northern capital
 this is that edinburgh which we
have heard so much 
 even so said the falconer yonder
stands auld reekie you may see the
smoke hover over her at twenty miles distance
as the goeshawk hangs over a plump
 young wildducks ay yonder is the
m the abbot
heart scotland and each throb that she
gives is felt from the edge sol way to
duncan'sbayhead see yonder is the old
castle and see to the right on yon rising
ground that is the castle craigmillar
which i have known a merry place in my
time
 was it not there said the page in a
low voice that the queen held her
court 
ay ay replied the falconer queen
she was then though you must not call her
so now well they may say what they will
i many a true heart will be sad for mary
stuart e'en if all be true men say her
for look you master rolandshe was the
loveliest creature to look upon that i ever
saw with eye and no lady in the land liked
better the fair flight a falcon i was at
the great match on rosinmoor betwixt
bothwell he was a black sight to her
that bothwell and the baron roslin
who could judge a hawk's flight as well as
any man in scotland a butt rhenish
the abbot 
and a ring gold was the wager and it
was flown as fairly for as ever was red gold
and bright wine and to see her there on
her white palfrey that flew as if it scorned
to touch more than the heather blossom 
and to hear her voice as clear and sweet
as the mavis's whistle mix among our jolly
whooping and whistling and to mark all
the nobles dashing round her happiest he
who got a word or look tearing through
moss and hang and venturing neck and
limb to gain the praise a bold rider and
the blink a bonnie queen's bright eye 
she will see little hawking where she lies
now ay ay pomp and pleasure pass away
as speedily as the wap a falcon's wing
 and where is this poor queen now
confined said koland graeme interested
in the fate a woman whose beauty and
grace had made so strong an impression
even on the blunt and careless character 
adam woodcock
 where is she now imprisoned said
adam woodcock why in some castle in
vol b
 the abbot
the north they say know not where for
my part nor is it worth while to vex oneself
anent what cannot be mended an she
had guided her power well whilst she had
it she had not come to so evil a pass men
say she must resign her crown to this little
baby a prince for that they will trust her
with it no longer our master has been as
busy as his neighbours in all this work if
the queen should come to her own again
avenel castle is like to smoke for it unless
he makes his bargain all the better
 in a castle in the north queen mary
is confined said the page
ti why ay they say so at least in a
castle beyond that great river which comes
down yonder and looks like a river but it is
a branch the sea and as bitter as brine
 and amongst all her subjects said the
page with some emotion is there none
that will adventure any thing for her relief

that is a kittle question said the falconer
 and if you ask it often master
the abbot 
roland i am fain to tell you that you will
be mewed up yourself in some those castles
if they do not prefer twisting your
head off to save farther trouble with you 
adventure any thing lord why murray
has the wind in his poop now man and
flies so high and strong that the devil a
wing them can match him no no
there she is and there she must lie till
heaven send her deliverance or till her
son has the management all but murray
will never let her loose again he knows
her too well and hark thee we are now
bound for holyrood where thou wilt find
plenty news and courtiers to tell it 
but take my counsel and keep a calm
sough as the scots say hear every man's
counsel and keep your own and if you
hap to learn any news you like leap not upas
if you were to put on armour direct in
the cause our old mr wingate says and
he knows courtcattle well that if you are
told old king could is come alive again you
should turn it off with and is he in truth 
 the abbot
i heard not it and should seem no
more moved than if one told you by way
 novelty that old king could was dead and
buried wherefore look well to your bearing
master roland for i promise you you
come among a generation that are keen asa
hungry hawk and never be dagger out
 sheath at every wry word you hear spoken
 for you will find as hot blades as yourself
and then will be letting blood without
advice either leech or almanac
 you shall see how staid i will be and
how cautious my good friend said graeme
 but blessed lady what goodly house is
that which is lying all in ruins so close to
the city have they been playing at the
abbot unreason here and ended the
gambol by burning the church 
 there again now replied his companion
 you go down the wind like a wild
haggard that minds neither lure nor beck
that is a question you should have asked
in as low a tone as i shall answer it
if i stay here long said roland
the abbot 
grasme it is like i shall lose the natural
use my voice but what are the ruins
then 
 the kirk field said the falconer
in a low and impressive whisper laying at
the same time his finger on his lip ask
no more about it somebody got foul play
and somebody got the blame it and the
game began there which perhaps may not
be played out in our time poor henry
darnley to be an ass he understood somewhat
 a hawk but they sent him on the
wing through the air himself one bright
moonlight night
the memory this catastrophe was so
recent that the page averted his eyes with
horror from the scathed ruins in which it
had taken place and the accusations
against the queen to which it had given
rise came over his mind with such strength
as to balance the compassion he had begun
to entertain for her present forlorn situation

it was indeed with that agitating state
 the abbot
 mind which arises partly from horror
but more from eager interest and curiosity
that young graeme found himself actually
traversing the scene those tremendous
events the report which had disturbed
the most distant solitudes in scotland like
the echoes distant thunder rolling among
the mountains
now he thought now or never shall i
become a man and bear my part in those
deeds which the simple inhabitants our
hamlets repeat to each other as if they were
wrought by beings a superior race to
their own i will know now wherefore the
knight avenel carries his crest so much
above those the neighbouring baronage
and how it is that men by valour and wisdom
work their way from the hoddin gray
coat to the cloak scarlet and gold men
say i have not much wisdom to recommend
me and if that be true courage must doit
for i will be a man amongst living men
or a dead corpse amongst the dead
from these plans ambition he turned
the abbot 
his thoughts to those pleasure and began
to form many conjectures when and where
he should see catherine seyton and in
what manner their acquaintance was to be
renewed with such conjectures he was
amusing himself when he found that they
had entered the city and all other feelings
were suspended in the sensation giddy
astonishment with which the inhabitant 
a solitary country is affected when for the
first time he finds himself in the streets 
a large and populous city a unit in the
midst thousands
the principal street edinburgh was
then as now one the most spacious in
europe the extreme height the houses
and the variety gothic gables and battlements
and balconies by which the skyline
on each side was crowned and terminated
together with the width the street
itself might have struck with surprise a
more practised eye than that young
graeme the population close packed
within the walls the city and at this time
 the abbot
increased by the number the lords 
the king's party who had thronged to edinburgh
to wait upon the regent murray
absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide
and stately street instead the shopwindows
which are now calculated for the
display goods the traders had their open
booths projecting on the street in which
as in the fashion the modern bazaars all
was exposed which they had upon sale
and though the commodities were not 
the richest kinds yet greene seemed to seethe
wealth the whole world in the various
bales flanders cloths and the specimens
 tapestry and at other places the display
 domestic utensils and pieces silverplate
struck him with wonder the sight 
cutlers booths furnished with swords and
poniards which were manufactured in scotland
and with pieces defensive armour
imported from flanders added to his surprise
 and at every step he found so much
to admire and to gaze upon that adam
woodcock had no little difficulty in prethe
abbot 
wailing on him to advance through such
a scene enchantment
the sight the crowds which filled the
streets was equally a subject wonder
here a gay lady in her muffler or silken
veil traced her way delicately a gentleman
usher making way for her a page
bearing up her train and a waiting gentlewoman
carrying her bible and intimating
that her purpose was towards the church 
there he might see groupe citizens bending
the same way with their short flemish
cloaks wide trowsers and highcaped doublets
a fashion to which as well as to their
bonnet and feather the scots were long
faithful then again came the clergyman
himself in his black geneva cloak and band
lending a grave and attentive ear to the discourse
 several persons who accompanied
him and who were doubtless holding serious
converse on the religious subject he was
about to treat nor did there lack passengers
 a different class and appearance
b 
s the abbot
at every turn roland graeme might see
a gallant ruffle along in the newer or french
mode his doublet slashed and his points
 the same colours with the lining his long
sword on one side and his poniard on the
other behind him a body stout servingmen
proportioned to his estate and quality
all whom walked with the air military
retainers and were armed with sword and
buckler the latter being a small round
shield not unlike the highland target having
a steel spike in the centre two 
these parties each headed by a person 
importance chanced to meet in the very
centre the street or as it was called
 the crown the causeway a post 
honour as tenaciously asserted in scotland
as that giving or taking the wall
used to be in the more southern part the
island the two leaders being equal rank
and most probably either animated by political
dislike or by recollection some
feudal enmity marched close up to each
other without yielding an inch to the right
the abbot 
or the left and neither shewing the least
purpose giving way they stopped for an
instant and then drew their swords their
followers imitated their example about a
score weapons at once flashed in the
sun and there was an immediate clatter 
swords and bucklers while the followers on
either side cried their master's name the
one shouting help a leslie a leslie 
while the others answered with shouts 
seyton seyton with the additional punning
slogan set on set on bear the
knaves to the ground
if the falconer found difficulty in getting
the page to go forward before it was now
perfectly impossible he reined up his
horse clapped his hands and delighted
with the fray cried and shouted as fast as
any those that were actually engaged
in it
the noise and cries thus arising on the
high gait as it was called drew into the
quarrel two or three other parties gentlemen
and their servants besides some single
passengers who hearing a fray betwixt these
 the abbot
two distinguished names took part in it either
for love or hatred
the combat became now very sharp
and although the swordand buckler men
made more clatter and noise than they
did real damage yet several good cuts
were dealt among them and those who
wore rapiers a more formidable weapon
than the ordinary scottish sword gave and
received dangerous wounds two men were
already stretched on the causeway and
the party seyton began to give ground
being much inferior in number to the
other with which several the citizens
had united themselves when young roland
graeme beholding their leader a noble
gentleman fighting bravely and hard
pressed with numbers could withhold no
longer adam woodcock he said an
you be a man draw and let us take part
with the seyton and without waiting a
reply or listening to the falconers earnest
entreaty that he would leave alone a strife
in which he had no concern the fiery youth
sprung from his horse drew his short sword
the abbot 
and shouting like the rest a seyton a
seyton set on set on thrust forward into
the throng and struck down one those
who was pressing hardest upon the gentleman
whose cause he espoused this sudden
reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker
party who began to renew the combat
with much spirit when four the magistrates
 the city distinguished by their
velvet cloaks and gold chains came up with
a guard halberdiers and citizens armed
with long weapons who well accustomed
to such service thrust boldly forward and
compelled the swordsmen to separate who
immediately retreated in different directions
leaving such the wounded on both
sides as had been disabled in the fray lying
on the street
the falconer who had been tearing his
beard for anger at his comrade's rashness
now rode up to him with the horse which
he had caught by the bridle and accosted
him with master roland master goose
master madcap will it please you to
get on horse and budge or will you res
the abbot
main here to be carried to prison and made
to answer for this pretty day's work 
the page who had begun his retreat
along with the seytons just as if he had
been one their natural allies was by this
unceremonious application made sensible
that he was acting a foolish part and
obeying adam woodcock with some sense
 shame he sprung actively on horseback
and upsetting with the shoulder the animal
a cityofficer who was making towards
him he began to ride smartly down the
street along with his companion and was
quickly out the reach the hue and
cry in fact rencounters the kind
were so common in edinburgh at this period
that the disturbance seldom excited
much attention after the affray was over
unless some person consequence chanced
to have fallen an accident which imposed
on his friends the duty avenging
his death upon the first convenient opportunity
so feeble indeed was the arm 
the police that it was not unusual for such
skirmishes to last for hours where the parthe
abbot 
ties were numerous and well matched but
at this time the regent a man great
strength character aware the mischief
which usually arose from such acts violence
had prevailed with the magistrates to
keep a constant guard on foot for preventing
or separating such affrays as had happened
in the present case
the falconer and his young companion
were now riding down the canongate and
had slackened their pace to avoid attracting
attention the rather that there seemed to
be no appearance pursuit roland hung
his head as one who was conscious his conduct
had been none the wisest while his
companion thus addressed him
will you be pleased to tell me one
thing master roland graeme and that is
whether there be a devil incarnate in you
or no 
 truly master adam woodcock answered
the page i would fain hope there
is not
 then said adam i would fain know
 the abbot
by what other influence or instigation you
are perpetually at one or the other 
some bloody brawl what i pray had
you to do with these seytons and leslie
that you never heard the names in your
life before 
you are out there my friend said roland
graeme i have my own reasons for
being a friend to the seytons
 they must have been very secret reasons
then answered adam woodcock
for i think i could have wagered you had
never known one the name and i am
apt to believe still that it was rather your
unhallowed passion for that clashing cold
iron which has as much charm for you as
the clatter a brass pan hath for a hive 
bees more than any care either for seyton
or for leslie that persuaded you to thrust
your fool's head into a quarrel that no ways
concerned you but take this for a warning
my young master that if you are to draw
sword with every man who draws sword
on the highgait here it will be scarce
the abbot 
worth your while to sheathe bilbo again for
the rest your life since if i guess rightly
it will scarce endure on such terms for
many hours all which i leave to your serious
consideration
by my word adam i honour your
advice and i promise you that i will practise
by it as faithfully as if were sworn
apprentice to you to the trade and mystery
 bearing myself with all wisdom and safety
through the new paths life that i am
about to be engaged in
 and therein you will do well said the
falconer and i do not quarrel with you
master roland for having a grain overmuch
spirit because i know one may bring
to the hand a wild hawk which one never
can a dunghill hen and so betwixt two
faults you have the best side on't but besides
your peculiar genius for quarrelling
and lugging out your side companion my
dear master roland you have also the gift
 peering under every woman's muffler and
screen as if you expected to find an old
acquaintance though were you to spy one
 the abbot
i should be as much surprised at it well
wetting how few you have seen these same
wildfowl as i was at your taking so deep
an interest even now in the seyton
 tush man nonsense and folly answered
roland graeme i but sought to
see what eyes these gentle hawks have got
under their hood
ay but it's a dangerous subject inquiry
said the falconer you had better
hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to
perch upon look you master roland
these pretty wildgeese cannot be hawked
at without risk they have as many divines
bolting and villeins as the most
gamesome quarry that falcon ever flew at
and besides every woman them is manned
with her husband or her kind friend
or her brother or her cousin or her sworn
servant at the least but you heed me not
master roland though i know the game
so well your eye is all on that pretty damsel
who trips down the gait before us by
my certes i will warrant her a blithe dancer
either in reel or revel a pair silver
the abbot 
morisco bells would become these pretty
ancles as well as the jesses would suit the
fairest norway hawk
thou art a fool adam said the page
and i care not a button about the girl or
her ancles but what the foul fiend one
must look at something
 very true master roland grime
said his guide but let me pray you to
chuse your objects better look you there
is scarce a woman walks this highgait with
a silk screen or a berlin muffler but as i
said before she has either gentleman usher
before her or kinsman or lover or husband
at her elbow or it may be a brace stout
fellows with sword and buckler not so far
behind but what they can follow close 
but you heed me no more than a mossbank
minds a yellow holding
 o yes i do i do mind you indeed
said roland graeme but hold my nag a
bit i will be with you in the exchange 
a whistle so saying and ere adam woodcock
could finish the sermon which was 
the abbot
ing on his tongue roland graeme to the
falconer's utter astonishment threw him
the bridle his jennet jumped off horseback
and pursued down one the closes
or narrow lanes which opening under a
vault terminate upon the main street the
very maiden to whom his friend had accused
him shewing so much attention and who
had turned down the pass in question
saint mary saint magdalen saint benedict
saint barnabas said the poor falconer
when he found himself thus suddenly
brought to a pause in the midst the
canongate and saw his young charge start
off like a madman in quest a damsel
whom he had never as adam supposed
seen in his life before saint satan
and saint beelzebub for this would make
one swear saint and devil what can have
come over the lad with a wanton and
what shall i do the whilst he will have
his throat cut the poor lad as sure as i
was born at the foot roseberry topping
could find some one to hold the
the abbor 
horses but they are as sharp here northaway
as in canny yorkshire herself and
quit bridle quit pitt as we say an i could
but see one our folks now a holly sprig
were worth a gold tassel or could i but
see one the regent's men but to leave
the horses to a stranger that i cannot 
and to leave the place while the lad is in
jeopardy that i won't
we must leave the falconer however in
the midst his distress and follow the hotheaded
youth who was the cause his perplexity

the latter part adam woodcock's sage
remonstrance had been in a great measure
lost upon roland for whose benefit it was
intended because in one the female
forms which tripped along the street muffled
in a veil striped silk like the women
 brussels at this day his eye had discerned
something which closely resembled the
exquisite shape and spirited bearing catherine
seyton during all the grave advice
which the falconer was dinning into
his ear his eye continued intent upon so
 the abbot
interesting an object observation and
at length as the damsel just about to dive
under one the arched passages which
afford outlet to the canongate from the
houses beneath a passage graced bya projecting
shield arms supported by two
huge foxes stone had lifted her veil for
the purpose perhaps descrying who the
horseman was who for some time had eyed
her so closely young roland saw under
the shadow the silken plaid enough
 the bright azure eyes fair locks and
blithe features to induce him like an inexperienced
and rash madcap whose wilful
ways had never been traversed by contradiction
nor much subjected to consideration
to throw the bridle his horse into
adam woodcock's hand and leave him to
play the waiting gentleman while he dashed
down the paved court after catherine
seyton all as aforesaid
women's wits are proverbially quick but
apparently those catherine suggested no
better expedient than fairly to betake herthe
abbot 
self to speed foot in hopes baffling the
page's vivacity by getting safely lodged before
he could discover where but a youth
 eighteen in pursuit a mistress is not
so easily outstripped catherine fled across
a paved court decorated with large formal
vases stone in which yews cypresses
and other evergreens vegetated in sombre
sullenness and gave a correspondent degree
 solemnity to the high and heavy
building in front which they were placed
as ornaments aspiring towards a square
portion the blue hemisphere corresponding
exactly in extent to the quadrangle in
which they were stationed and all around
which rose huge black walls exhibiting windows
in rows five stories with heavy architraves
over each bearing armorial and religious
devices
through this court catherine seyton
flashed like a hunted doe making the best
use those pretty legs which had attracted
the commendation even the reflective
and cautious adam woodcock she hast
 the abbot
 towards a large door in the centre 
the lower front the court pulled the
bobbin till the latch flew up and ensconced
herself in the ancient mansion but
if she fled like a doe roland graeme followed
with the speed and ardour a youthful
staghound loosed for the first time on
his prey he kept her in view in spite
 her efforts for it is remarkable what
an advantage in such a race the gallant
who desires to see possesses over the maiden
who wishes not to be seen an advantage
which i have known counterbalance
a great start in point distance in short
he saw the waving her screen or veil
at one corner heard the tap her foot
light as that was as it crossed the court and
caught a glimpse her figure just as she
entered the door the mansion
roland graeme inconsiderate and headlong
as w'c have described him having no
knowledge real life but from the romances
which he had read and not an idea 
checking himself in the midst any eager
the abbot 
impulse possessed besides much courage
and readiness never hesitated for a
moment to approach the door through
which the object his search had disappeared
he too pulled the bobbin and
the latch though heavy and massive answered
to the summons and arose the
page entered with the same precipitation
which had marked his whole proceeding
and found himself in a large gloomy hall
or vestibule dimly enlightened by latticed
casements painted glass and rendered
yet dimmer through the exclusion the
sunbeams owing to the height the walls
 those buildings by which the courtyard
was enclosed the walls the hall were
surrounded with suits ancient and rusted
armour interchanged with huge and
massive stone scutcheons bearing double
tressuresfleured and counter fled red wheatsheaves
coronets and so forth things to
which roland graeme gave not a moment's
attention
in fact he only deigned to observe the
vol c
 the abbot
figure catherine seyton who deeming
herself safe in the hall had stopped
to take breath after her course and was
reposing herself for a moment on a large
oaken settle which stood at the upper 
 the hall the noise roland's entrance
at once disturbed her she started up with
a faint scream surprise and escaped
through one the several foldingdoors
which opened into this apartment as a common
centre this door which roland
grasme instantly approached opened on a
large and well lighted gallery at the upper
 which he could hear several voices
and the noise hasty steps approaching
toward the hall or vestibule a little recalled
to sober thought by an appearance 
serious danger he was deliberating whether
he should stand fast or retire when catherine
seyton reentered from a side door
running towards him with as much speed
as a few minutes since she had fled from
him
o what mischief brought you hither 
the abbot 
she said fly fly or you are a dead man
or stay they come flight is impossible
 say you came to ask after lord seyton

she sprung from him and disappeared
through the door by which she had made
her second appearance and at the same
instant a pair large foldingdoors at the
upper the gallery flew open with
vehemence and six or seven young gentlemen
richly dressed pressed forward into
the apartment having for the greater part
their swords drawn
 who is it said one dare intrude onus
in our own mansion 
 cut him to pieces said another let
him pay for this day's insolence and violences
 he is some follower the toties
no by saint mary said another he
i a follower the archfiend and ennobled
clown halbert glendinning who takes the
style avenel once a church vassal now
a pillager the church
 it is so said a fourth i know him
 the abbot
by the holly sprig which is their cognisance
secure the door he must answer
for this insolence
two the gallants hastily drawing their
weapon past on to the door by which roland
had entered the hall and stationed themselves
there as if to prevent his escape the
others advanced on gramme who had just
sense enough to perceive that any attempt
at resistance would be alike fruitless and
imprudent at once and by various voices
none which sounded amicably the page
was required to say who he was whence he
came his name his errand and who sent
him hither the number the questions
demanded him at once afforded a momentary
apology for his remaining silent
and ere that brief truce had elapsed a personage
entered the hall at whose appearance
those who had gathered fiercely around
roland fell back with respect
this was a tall man whose dark hair was
already grizzled though his eye and haughty
features retained all the animation 
the abbot 
youth the upper part his person was
undressed to his holland shirt whose ample
folds were stained with blood but he
wore a mantle crimson lined with rich
fur cast around him which supplied the deficiency
 his dress on his head he had
a crimson velvet bonnet looped up on one
side with a small golden chain many
links which going thrice round the hat was
fastened by a medal agreeable to the fashion
amongst the grandees the time
whom have you here sons and kinsmen
said he around whom you crowd
thus roughly know you not that the shelter
 this roof should secure every one fair
treatment who shall come hither either in
fair peace or in open and manly hostility 
 but here my lord answered one 
the youths sis a knave who comes on treacherous
espial 
i deny the charge said roland grime
boldly i came to inquire after my lord
seyton
 a likely tale answered his accusers
 the abbot
in the mouth a follower blending

 stay young men said the lord seyton
for it was that nobleman himself let
me look at this youth by heaven it is the
very same who came so boldly to my side
not very many minutes since when some 
my own knaves bore themselves with more
respect to their own worshipful safety than
to mine stand back from him for he well
deserves honour and a friendly welcome at
your handsjinstead this rough treatment
they fell back on all sides obedient to
lord seyton's commands who taking roland
grasme by the hand thanked him for
his prompt and gallant assistance adding
that he nothing doubted the same interest
which he had taken in his cause in the
affray brought him hither to inquire after
his hurt
roland bowed low in acquiescence
 or is there any thing in which i can
serve you to shew my sense your ready
gallantry
the abbot 
bat the page thinking it best to abide by
the apology for his visit which the lord
seyton had so aptly himself suggested replied
 that to be assured his lordship's
safety had been the only cause his intrusion
he judged he added he had
seen him receive some hurt in the affray
 a trifle said lord seyton i had but
stripped my doublet that the chirurgeon
might put some dressing on the paltry
scratch when these rash boys interrupted
us with their clamour
roland graeme making a low obeisance
was now about to depart for relieved from
the danger being treated as a spy he began
next to fear that his companion adam
woodcock whom he had so unceremoniously
quitted would either bring him into
some farther dilemma by venturing into
the hotel in quest him or ride offend leave
him behind altogether but lord seyton did
not permit him to escape so easily tarry
he said young man and let me know
thy rank and name the seyton has late
 the abbot
been more wont to see friends and followers
shrink from his side than to receive aid
from strangers but a new world may come
round in which he may have the chance 
rewarding his well wishers
my name is roland graeme my lord
answered the youth a page who for the
present is in the service sir halbert
glendinning
 i said so from the first said one the
young men my ife i will wager that this
is a shaft out the heretic's quiver a stratagem
from first to last to injeer into your
confidence some espial his own they
know how to teach both boys and women
to play the intelligencers
 that is false if it be spoken me
said roland no man in scotland should
teach me such a foul part 
i believe thee boy said seyton for
thy strokes were too fair to be dealt upon
an understanding with those that were to
receive them credit me however i little
expected to have help at need from one 
the abbot 
your master's household and i would know
what moved thee in my quarrel to shine
own endangering 
 so please you my lord said roland
i think my master himself would not have
stood by and seen an honourable man borne
to earth by odds if his single arm could
help him such at least is the lesson we
were taught in chivalry at the castle 
avenel
 the good seed hath fallen into good
ground young man said seyton but
alas if thou practise such honourable war
in these dishonourable days when right is
every where borne down by mastery thy
life my poor boy will be but a short one
 let it be short so it be honourable
said roland graeme and permit me now
my lord to commend me to your grace and
to take my leave a comrade waits with
my horse in the street
take this however young man said
lord seyton undoing from his bonnet the
c
 the abbot
golden chain and medal and wear it for
my sake
with no little pride roland greene accepted
the gift which he hastily fastened
around his bonnet as he had seen gallants
wear such an ornament and renewing his
obeisance to the baron left the hall traversed
the court and appeared in the street
just as adam woodcock vexed and anxious
at his delay had determined to leave the
horses to their fate and go in quest his
youthful comrade whose barn hast thou
broken next he exclaimed greatly relieved
by his appearance although his countenance
indicated that he had passed through
an agitating scene
 ask me no questions said roland
leaping gaily on his horse j but see how
short time it takes to win a chain gold
pointing to that which he now wore
 now god forbid that thou hast either
stolen it or reft it by violence said the
falconer for otherwise i wot not how
the abbot 
the devil thou couldst compass it i have
been often here ay for months at an 
and no one gave me either chain or medal

 thou seest i have got one on shorter
acquaintance with the city answered the
page and set thine honest heart at rest 
that which is fairly won and freely given
is neither reft nor stolen
 marry hang thee with thy fanfarona
about thy neck said the falconer i
think water will not drown nor hemp strangle
thee thou hast been discarded as
my lady's page to come in again as my
lord's squire and for following a noble
young damsel into some great household
thou gets a chain and a medal where another
would have had the baton across his
shoulders if he missed having the dirk in
a name given to the gold chains worn by the military
men the period it is spanish origin for
the fashion wearing these costly ornaments was
much followed amongst the conquerors the ney
world
 the abbot
his body but here we come in front 
the old abbey bear thy good luck with
you when you cross these paved stones
and by our lady you may brag scotland
as he spoke they checked their horses
where the huge old vaulted entrance to
the abbey or palace holyrood crossed
the termination the street down which
they had proceeded the courtyard 
the palace opened within this gloomy porch
shewing the front an irregular pile 
monastic buildings one wing which is
still extant forming a part the modern
palace erected in the days charles i
at the gate the porch the falconer
and page resigned their horses to the 
in attendance the falconer commanding
him with an air authority to
carry them safely to the stables we follows
he said the knight avenel ave
must bear ourselves for what we are here
said he in a whisper to roland for everyone
here ig looked on as they demean themselves
 and he that is too modest must to
the abbor 
the wall as the proverb says therefore
cock thy bonnet man and let us brook the
causeway bravely
assuming therefore an air consequence
corresponding to what he supposed
to be his master's importance and quality
adam woodcock led the way into the courtyard
 the palace holyrood
 the abbot
chapter iii
the sky is clouded gaspard
and the vex'd ocean sleeps a troubled sleep
beneath a lurid gleam parting sunshine
such slumber hangs o'er discontented lands
while factions doubt as yet if they have strength
to front the open battle
albion a poem
the youthful page paused on the entrance
 the courtyard and implored his guide
to give him a moment's breathing space
 let me but look around me man said
he you consider not i have never seen
such a scene as this before and this is 
 the resort the gallant and gay
and the fair and the wise and the powerful

ay marry is it said woodcock 
but i wish i could hood thee as they do
the hawks for thou stares as wildly as if
s
the abbot 
you sought another fray or another fanfa
roma i would i had thee safely housed
for thou loosest wild as a goeshawk
it was indeed no common sight to roland
the vestibule a palace traversed by
its various groupes some radiant with
gaiety some pensive and apparently weighed
down by affairs concerning the state
or concerning themselves here the hoary
statesman with his cautious yet commanding
look his furred cloak and sable pantoufles
j there the soldier in buff and steel his
long sword jarring against the pavement and
his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow 
there again passed my lord's servingman
high heart and bloody hand humble
to his master and his master's equals insolent
to all others to these might be added
the poor suitor with his anxious look
and depressed mien the officer full his
brief authority elbowing his betters and
possibly his benefactors out the road 
the proud priest who sought a better benefice
 the proud baron who sought a grant
 the abbot
 church lands the robber chief who came
to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had
inflicted on his neighbours the plundered
franklin who came to seek vengeance for
that which he had himself received besides
there was the mustering and disposition
 guards and soldiers the dispatching
 messengers and the receiving them
the trampling and neighing horses
without the gate the flashing arms and
rustling plumes and jingling spurs
within it in short it was that gay and
splendid confusion in which the eye 
youth sees all that is brave and brilliant and
that experience much that is doubtful
deceitful false and hollow hopes that will
never be gratified promises which will never
be fulfilled pride in the disguise 
humility and insolence in that frank
and generous bounty
as tired the eager and enraptured
attention which the page gave to a scene
so new to him adam woodcock endeavoured
to get him to move forward bethe
abbot 
fore his exuberance astonishment should
attract the observation the sharpwitted
denizens the court the falconer himself
became an object attention to a gay menial
in a darkgreen bonnet and feather with
a cloak a corresponding colour laid down
as the phrase then went by six broad bars 
silver lace and welted with violet and silver
the words recognition burst from
both at once what adam woodcock
at court and what michael 
 and how runs the hackit greyhound
bitch now 
the war for the wear like ourselves
adam eight years this grass no four legs
will carry a dog for ever j but we keep her
for the breed and so she scapes borderdoom
 but why stand you gazing there 
i promise you my lord has wished for you
and asked for you
 my lord murray asked for me and
he regent the kingdom too said adam
i hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my
good lord but i fancy his good lordship
remembers the day's sport on carnwarth
 the abbot
moor and my drummelzier falcon that
beat the hawks from the isle man and
won his lordship a hundred crowns from
the southern baron whom they called stanley

nay not to flatter thee adam said
his courtfriend he remembers nought 
thee or thy falcon either he hath flown
many a higher flight since that and struck
his quarry too but come come hither
away i trust we are to be good comrades
on the old score
what said adam you would have
me crash a pot with you but i must first
dispose my eyass where he will neither
have girl to chase or lad to draw sword
upon
is the youngster such a one said michael

ay by my hood he flies at all game
replied woodcock
then had he better come with us said
michael wingthewind for we cannot
have a proper carouse just now only i
would wet my hps and so must you i want
the abbot 
to hear the news from saint mary's before
you see my lord and i will let you know
how the wind sits up yonder
while he thus spoke he led the way
to a side door which opened into the
court and threading several dark passages
with the air one who knew the
most secret recesses the palace conducted
them to a small matted chamber where
he placed bread and cheese and a foaming
flagon ale before the falconer who
immediately did justice to the latter ina
hearty draught which nearly emptied
the measure having drawn his breath
and dashed the froth from his whiskers he
observed that his anxiety for the boy had
made him deadly dry
 mend your draught said his hospitable
friend again supplying the flagon from
a pitcher which stood beside i know the
way to the butterybar and now mind
what i say this morning the earl morton
came to my lord in a mighty chafe
what they keep the old friendship
then said woodcock
 the abbot
ay ay man what else said michael
 one hand must scratch the other
but in a mighty chafe was my lord morton
who to say truth looketh on such occasions
altogether uncanny and as it were
fiendish and he says to my lord for i was
in the chamber taking orders about a cast
 hawks that are to be fetched from darnway
 they match your long winged falcons
friend adam
 i will believe that when i see them fly
as high a pitch replied woodcock this
professional observation forming a sort 
parenthesis
 however said michael pursuing his
tale my lord morton in a mighty
chafe asked my lord regent whether he
was well dealt with for my brother said
he should have had a gift to be commendator
 kennaquhair and to have all the
temporalities erected into a lordship regality
for his benefit and here said he
the false monks have had the insolence to
chuse a new abbot to put his claim in my
brother's way j and moreover the rascality
the abbot 
 the neighbourhood have burnt and plundered
all that was left in the abbey so that
tiny brother will not have a house to dwell
in when he hath ousted the lazy hounds 
priests and my lord seeing him chafed said
mildly to him these are shrewd tidings
douglass but i trust they be not true for
halbert glendinning went southward yesterday
with a band spears and assuredly
had either these chances happened that
the monks had presumed to chuse an abbot
or that the abbey had been burnt as
you say he had taken order on the spot for
the punishment such insolence and had
dispatched us a messenger and the earl
 morton replied now i pray you adam
to notice that i say this out love to you
and your lord and also for old comradeship
and also because sir halbert hath
done me good and may again and also
because i love not the earl morton as
indeed more fear than like him so then it
were a foul deed in you to betray me but
said the earl to the regent take heed my
lord you trust not this glendinning too
 the abbot
far he comes churl's blood which was
never true to the nobles by saint andrew
these were his very words and besides
he said he hath a brother a monk in saint
mary's and walks all by his guidance and
is making friends on the border with buck
and with fernieherst and will join
hand with them were there likelihood a
new world and my lord answered like a
free noble lord as he is tush my lord
 morton i will be warrant for blending
faith and for his brother he is a
dreamer that thinks nought but 
and breviary and if such hap have chanced
as you tell i look to receive from glendining
the cowl a hanged monk and
the head a riotous churl by way sharp
and sudden justice and my lord morton
left the place and as it seemed tome
somewhat malcontent but since that
time iii lord has asked me more than
once whether there has arrived no messenger
from the knight avenel and all this
i have told you that you may frame your
the abbot 
discourse to the best purpose for it seems
to me that my lord will not be well pleased
if aught has happened like what my
lord morton said and if your lord hath
not ta'en strict orders with it
there was something in this communication
which fairly blanked the bold visage
 adam woodcock in spite the reinforcement
which his natural hardihood had
received from the berry brown ale holyrood

 what was it he said about a churl's
head that grim lord morton said the
discontented falconer to his friend
nay it was my lord regent who
said that he expected if the abbey was injured
your knight would send him the head
 the ringleader among the rioters
 nay but is this done like a good protestant
said adam woodcock or a true
lord the congregation we used to be
their whiteboys and darlings when we pulled
down the convents in fife and perthshires

 the abbot
 ay but that said michael was
when old mother rome held her own and
her great folks were determined she should
have no shelter for her head in scotland
bat now that the priests are fled in all quarters
and their houses and lands are given
to our grandees they cannot see that weare
working the work reformation in destroying
the palaces zealous protestants

but i tell you saint mary's is not destroyed
 said woodcock in increasing agitation
 some trash painted windows
there were broken things that no nobleman
could have brooked in his housesome
stone saints were brought on their
marrowbones like old warrington at
chevychace but as for fire raising there
was not so much as a lighted lunt amongst
us save the match which the dragon had to
light the burning tow withal which he was
to spit against saint george nay i had
caution that
 how adam woodcock said his comthe
abbot s
rade i trust thou hadst no hand in such
a fair work look you adam i were loth
to terrify you and you just come from a
journey but i promise you earl morton
hath brought you down a maiden from halifax
you never saw the like her and
shell clip you round the neck and your
head will remain in her arms
pshaw answered adam i am too
old to have my head turned by any maiden
 them all i know my lord morton
will go as far for a buxom lass as any one 
but what the devil took him to halifax all
the way and if he have got a gamester
there what hath she to do with my head 
 much much answered michael
 herod's daughter who did such execution
with her foot and ancle danced not
raen'sheads offmore cleanly than this maidens
 morton tis an axe man an axe which
falls itself like a sash window and never
gives the headsman the trouble to wield it
 by my faith a shrewd device said
woodcock j heaven keep us free on't 
vol d
 the abbot
the page seeing no to the conversation
between these two old comrades and
anxious from what he had heard concerning
the fate the abbot now interrupted
their conference
methinks he said adam woodcock
thou hadst better deliver thy master's
letter to the regent questionless he
hath therein stated what has chanced at
kennaquhair in the way most advantageous
for all concerned
the boy is right said michael 
 my lord will be very impatient

 the child hath wit enough to keep
himself warm said adam woodcock producing
from his hawkingbag his lord's
letter addressed to the earl murray
 and for that matter so have i so master
roland you will e'en please to present
this yourself to the lord regent his presence
will be better graced by a young
page than by an old falconer
well said canny yorkshire replied
the abbot 
his friend and but now you were so earnest
to see our good lord why wouldst
thou put the lad into the noose that thou
may est slip tether thyself or doest thou
think the maiden will clasp his fair young
neck more willingly than thy old sunburnt
weasand 
 go to answered the falconer thy
wit towers high an it could strike the quarry
i tell thee the youth has nought to fear
he had nothing to do with the gambol 
a rare gambol it was michael as madcaps
ever played and i had made as rare a ballad
if we had had the luck to get it sung to
an but mum for that tace as i said
before is latin for a candle carry the
youth to the presence and i will remain
here with bridle in hand ready to strike
the spurs up to the rowelheads in case the
hawk flies my way i will soon put soltra
edge i trow betwixt the regent and me if
he means me less than fair play
come on then my lad said michael
 since thou must needs take the spring bec
the abbot
fore canny yorkshire so saying he led
the way through winding passages closely
followed by roland graeme until they arrived
at a large winding stone stair the
steps which were so long and broad and
at the same time so low as to render the
ascent uncommonly easy when they had
ascended about the height one storey
the guide stepped aside and pushed open
the door a dark and gloomy antichamber
 so dark indeed that his youthful companion
stumbled and nearly fell down
upon a low step which was awkwardly placed
on the very threshold
take heed said michael wingshewing
in a very low tone voice and first
glancing cautiously round to see if any one
listened take heed my young friend
for those who fall on these boards seldom
arise again seest thou that he added ina
still lower voice pointing to some dark
crimson stains on the floor on which a ray
 light shot through a small aperture and
traversing the general gloom the apartthe
abbot 
ment fell with mottled radiance seest
thou that youth walk warily for men have
fallen here before you
 what mean you said the page his
flesh creeping though he scarce knew why 
 is it blood 
ay ay said the domestic in the
same whispering tone and dragging the
youth on by the arm blood it is but
this is no time to question or even to look
at it blood it is foully and fearfully shed
as foully and fearfully avenged the
blood he added in a still more cautious
tone seignior david
koland greeme's heart throbbed when
he found himself so unexpectedly in the
scene rizzio's slaughter a catastrophe
which had chilled with horror all even
in that rude age which had been the theme
 wonder and pity through every cottage
and castle in scotland and had not escaped
that avenel but his guide hurried
him forward permitting no further
question and with the manner one
who has already tampered too much with
 the abbot
a dangerous subject a tap which he made
at a low door at one the vestibule
was answered by a huissier or usher who
opening it cautiously received michael's
intimation that a page waited the regent's
leisure who brought letters from the knight
 avenel
 the council is breaking up said the
usher but give me the packet his grace
the regent will presently see the messenger

 the packet replied the page must
be delivered into the regent's own hands 
such were the orders my master
the usher looked at him from head to
foot as if surprised at his boldness and then
replied with some asperity say you so
my young master thou lowest loudly to
be but a chicken and from a country barnyard
too
were it a time or place said roland
 thou shouldst see i can do more than
crow but do your duty and let the regent
know i wait his pleasure
the abbot 
 thou art but a pert knave to tell me
 my duty said the courtier in office but
i will find a time to shew you you are out
 yours meanwhile wait there till you are
wanted so saying he shut the door in
roland's face
michael wingthewind who had shrunk
from his youthful companion during this
altercation according to the established
maxim courtiers all ranks and in ail
ages now transgressed their prudential line
 conduct so far as to come up to him once
more thou art a hopeful young springaid
said he and i see right well old
yorkshire had reason in his caution thou
hast been five minutes in the court and
hast employed thy time so well as to make
a powerful and a mortal enemy out the
usher the councilchamber why man
you might almost as well have offended the
deputy butler
i care not what he is said roland
gramme i will teach whomsoever i speak
with to speak civilly to me in return i
 the abbot
did not come from avenel to be browbeaten
in holyrood
bravo my lad said michael j it is a
fine spirit if you can but hold it but seethe
door opens
the usher appeared and in a more civil
tone voice and manner said that his
grace the regent would receive the knight
 avenel's message and accordingly marshalled
roland graeme the way into the
apartment from which the council had
been just dismissed after finishing their consultations
there was in the room a long
oaken table surrounded by stools the
same wood with a large elbow chair covered
with crimson velvet at the head writing
materials and papers were lying therein
apparent disorder and one or two 
the privy counsellors who had lingered behind
assuming their cloaks bonnets and
swords and bidding farewell to the regent
were departing slowly by a large door on
the opposite side to that through which the
page entered apparently the earl murthe
abbot 
ray had made some jest for the smiling countenances
 the statesmen expressed that sort
 cordial reception which is paid by courtiers
to the condescending pleasantries a
prince
the regent himself was laughing heartily
as he said farewell my lords and hold
me remembered to the cock the north
he then turned slowly round towards
roland greene and the marks gaiety
real or assumed disappeared from his countenance
as completely as the passing bubbles
leave the dark mirror a still profound
lake into which a traveller has cast a stone 
in the course a minute his noble fear
lures had assumed their natural expression
 deep and even melancholy gravity
this distinguished statesman for as such
his worst enemies acknowledged him possessed
all the external dignity as well as almost
all the noble qualities which could
grace the power that he enjoyed j and had
he succeeded to the throne ashes legitimate
inheritance it is probable he would have
d f
 the abbot
been recorded as one scotland's wisest
and greatest kings but that he held his
authority by the deposition and imprisonment
 his sister and benefactress was a
crime which those only can excuse who
think ambition an apology for ingratitude
he was dressed plainly in black velvet after
the flemish fashion and wore in his
highcrowned hat a jewelled clasp which
looped it up on one side and formed the
only ornament his apparel he had his
poniard by his side and his sword lay on
the council table
such was the personage before whom
roland graeme now presented himself with
a feeling breathless awe very different
from the usual boldness and vivacity his
temper in fact he was from education and
nature forward but not impudent and was
much more easily controuled by the moral
superiority arising from the elevated talents
and renown those with whom he
conversed than pretensions founded only
on rank or external shew he might have
braved with indifference the presence an
the abbot 
earl merely distinguished by his belt and
coronet but he felt overawed in that the
eminent soldier and statesman the wielder
 a nation's power and the leader her
armies the greatest and wisest are flattered
by the deference youth so graceful
and becoming in itself and murray
took with much courtesy the letter from
the hands the abashed and blushing page
and answered with complaisance to the imperfect
and halfmuttered greeting which
he endeavoured to deliver to him on the
part sir halbert avenel he even
paused a moment ere he broke the silk
with which the letter was secured to ask
the page his name so much he was struck
with his very handsome features and form
 roland graeme he said repeating the
words after the hesitating page what 
the grahame the lennox 
no may lord replied roland my
parents dwelt in the debateable land
murray made no farther enquiry but
proceeded to read his dispatches during
the perusal which his brow began to ask
the abbot
some a stern expression displeasure as
that one who found something which at
once surprised and disturbed him he
sate down on the nearest seat frowned
till his eyebrows almost met together read
the letter twice over and was then silent
for several minutes at length raising
his head his eye encountered that the
usher who in vain endeavoured to exchange
the look eager and curious observation
with which he had been perusing the regent's
features for that open and noticing
expression countenance which in
looking at all seems as if it saw and marked
nothing a cast look which may be
practised with advantage by all those 
whatsoever degree who are admitted to
witness the familiar and unguarded hours
 their superiors great men are as jealous
 their thoughts as the wife king
candles was her charms and will as
readily punish those who have however
involuntarily beheld them in mental deshabille
and exposure
leave the apartment hyndman said
the abbot 
the regent sternly and carry your observation
elsewhere you are too knowing
sir for your post which by special order
is destined for men blunter capacity so 
now you look more like a fool than you did
for hyndman as may easily be supposed
was not a little discouraged by this rebuke
 keep that confused stare and it
may keep you your office begone sir 
the usher departed in dismay not forgetting
to register amongst his other causes
 dislike to roland graeme that he had
been the witness this disgraceful chiding
when he had left the apartment the regent
again addressed the page
 your name you say is armstrong 
 no replied roland my name is
graeme so please you roland graeme
whose forbears were designated heathergill
in the debateable land
 ay i knew it was a name from the
debateable land hast thou any acquaintances
here in edinburgh 
 my lord replied roland willing rash
the abbot
ther to evade this question than to answer
it directly for the prudence being silent
with respect to lord seyton's adventure
immediately struck him i have been in
edinburgh scarce an hour and that for the
first time in my life
 what and thou sir halbert blending
page said the regent
i was brought up as my lady's page
said the youth and left avenel castle for
the first time in my life at least since my
childhood only three days since
my lady's page repeated the earl
 murray as if speaking to himself it
was strange to send his lady's page on a
matter such deep concernment morton
will say it is a piece with the nomination
 his brother to be abbot and yet in some
sort an inexperienced youth will best serve
the turn what hast thou been taught
young man in thy doughty apprenticeship

 to hunt my lord and to hawk said
roland graeme
the abbot 
 to hunt coneys and to hawk at ouzel
said the regent smiling for such
are the sports ladies and their followers
graeme's cheek reddened deeply as he
replied not without some emphasis to
hunt red deer the first head and to
strike down herons the highest soar my
lord which in lothian speech may be
termed for aught i know coneys and ouzel
 also i can wield a brand and couch
a lance according to our border meaning 
in inland speech these may be termed 
and bullrushes
thy speech rings like metal said the
regent and i pardon the sharpness it
for the truth thou knowest then what
belongs to the duty a manatarms
so far as exercise can teach it without
real service in the field answered roland
grme but our knight permitted none
 his household to make raids and i never
had the good fortune to see a stricken
field
 the good fortune repeated the res
the abbot
gent smiling somewhat sorrowfully take
my word young man war is the only game
from which both parties rise losers
not always my lord answered the
page with his characteristic audacity if
fame speaks truth
 how sir said the regent colouring
in his turn and perhaps suspecting an
indiscreet allusion to the height which he
himself had attained by the hap civil war
because my lord said roland graeme
without change tone she who fights well
must have fame in life or honour in death 
and so war is a game from which no one
can rise a losers
the regent smiled and shook his head
when at that moment the door opened and
the earl morton presented himself
i come somewhat hastily he said and
i enter unannounced because my news are
 weight it is as i said edward glendining
is named abbot and
 hush my lord said the regent i
know it but
the abbot 
and perhaps you knew it before i did
my lord murray answered morton his
dark red brow growing darker and redder
as he spoke
 morton said murray suspect me
not touch not mine honour i have to
suffer enough from the calumnies foes
let me not have to contend with the unjust
suspicions my friends we are not
alone said he recollecting himself or i
gould tell you more
he led morton into one the deep
embrasures which the windows formed in
the massive wall and which afforded a retiring
place for their conversing apart in
this recess roland observed them speak
together with much earnestness murray
appearing to be grave and earnest and
morton having a jealous and offended air
which seemed gradually to give way to the
assurances the regent
as their conversation grew more earnest
they became gradually louder in speech
having perhaps forgotten the presence 
 the abbot
the page the more readily as his position
in the apartment placed him out sight
so that he found himself unwillingly privy
to more their discourse than he cared to
hear for page though he was a mean
curiosity after the secrets others had never
been numbered amongst roland's failings
 and moreover with all his natural
rashness he could not but doubt the safety
 becoming privy to the secret discourse
 these powerful and dreaded men still he
could neither stop hisearsnorwithpropriety
leave the apartment j and while he thought
 some means signifying his presence
he had already heard so much that to have
produced himself suddenly would have been
as awkward and perhaps as dangerous as
in quiet to abide the their conference
what he overheard however was
but an imperfect part their communication
 and although a more expert politician
acquainted with the circumstances 
the times would have had little difficulty in
tracing the meaning yet roland graeme
the abbot 
could only form very general and vague
conjectures as to the import their discourse

 all is prepared said murray and
lindesay is setting forward she must hesitate
no longer thou seest i act by thy
counsel and harden myself against softer
considerations
true my lord replied morton in
what is necessary to gain power you do not
hesitate but go boldly to the mark bat
are you as careful to defend and preserve
what you have won why this establishment
 domestics around her has not
your mother men and maidens enough to
tend her but you must consent to this superfluous
and dangerous retinue 
for shame morton a princess and
my sister could i do less than allow her due
tendance 
ay replied morton even thus fly
all your shafts smartly enough loosened
from the bow and not unskilfully aimed
but a breath foolish affection ever crosses
 the abbot
in the mid volley and sways the arrow from
the mark
say not so morton replied murray
i have both dared and done
yes enough to gain but not enough to
keep reckon not that she will think and
act thus you have wounded her deeply
both in pride and in power it signifies
nought that you would tent now the wound
with unavailing salves as matters stand
with you you must forfeit the title an
affectionate brother to hold that a bold
and determined statesman
 morton said murray with some impatience
 i brook not these taunts what
i have done i have done what i must further
do i must and will but i am not
made iron like thee and i cannot but
remember enough thismy purpose
holds
and i warrant me said morton the
choice these domestic consolations will
rest with 
here he whispered names which escaped
the abbot 
roland graeme's ear murray replied in a
similar tone but so much raised towards
the conclusion the sentence that the
page heard these words and him i
hold myself secure by glendinning's recommendation

ay which may be as much trustworthy
as his late conduct at the abbey 
saint mary's you have heard his brother's
election has taken place your favourite
sir halbert my lord murray has as
much fraternal affection as yourself
by heaven morton that taunt demanded
an unfriendly answer but i pardon it for
your brother also is concerned but this
election shall be annulled i tell you earl
 morton while i hold the sword state
in my royal nephew's name neither lord nor
knight in scotland shall dispute my authority
 and if i bear with insults from my
friends it is only while i know them to be
such and forgive their follies for their faithfulness

morton muttered what seemed to be
 the abbot
some excuse and the regent answered him
in a milder tone and then subjoined besides
i have a pledge besides glendinning's
recommendation for this youth's fidelity
his nearest relative has placed herself in my
hands as his security to be dealt withal as
his doings shall deserve
that is something replied morton 
 but yet in fair love and good will i must
still pray you to keep on your guard the
foes are stirring again as horseflies and
hornets become busy so soon as the stormblast
is over george seyton was cropping
the causeway this morning with a score
 men at his back and had a ruffle with
my friends the house leslie they
met at the trone and were fighting hard
when the provost with his guard partizans
came in thirdsman and staved them
asunder with their halberds as men part
dog and bear
he hath my order for such interference
said the regent has any one
been hurt 
the abbot 
 george seyton himself by black
ralph leslie the devil take the rapier that
ran not through from side to side ralph
has a bloody coxcomb by a blow from a
messanpage whom nobody knew dick
seyton windygowl is run through the
arm and two gallants the leslie have
suffered phlebotomy this is all the gentle
blood which has been spilled in the revel 
but a yeoman or two on both sides have
had bones broken and ears cropped the
ostlerwives who are like to be the only
losers by their miscarriage have dragged
the knaves off the street and are crying a
drunken coronach over them
 you take it lightly douglas said the
regent these broils and feuds would
shame the capital the great turk let
alone that a christian and reformed state
but if i live this gear shall be amended 
and men shall say when they read my story
that if it were my cruel hap to rise to power
by the dethronement a sister i employed
it when gained for the benefit the commonweal

 the abbot
and your friends replied morton j
wherefore i trust for your instant order
annulling the election this lurdane abbot
edward glendinning
 you shall be presently satisfied and
stepping forward he began to call soho
hyndman when suddenly his eye
lighted on roland graeme by my faith
douglas said he turning to his friend
here have been three at counsel
ay but only two can keep counsel
said morton the galliard must be disposed

 for shame morton an orphan boy 
hearken thee my child thou hast told
me some thy accomplishments canst
thou speak truth 
ay my lord when it serves my turn
replied gramme
 it shall serve thy turn now said the
regent and falsehood shall be thy destruction
how much hast thou heard or
understood what we two have spoken
together 
the abbot 
but little my lord replied roland
graeme boldly which met my apprehension
saving that it seemed to me as if in
something you doubted the faith the
knight avenel under whose roof i was
nurtured
and what hast thou to say on that
point young man continued the regent
bending his eyes upon him with a keen and
strong expression observation
that said the page depends on the
quality those who speak against his honour
whose bread i have long eaten if
they be my inferiors i say they lie and
will maintain what i say with my barton 
if my equals still i say they lie and will do
battle in the quarrel if they list with my
sword if my superiors he paused
 proceed boldly said the regent
 what if thy superior said aught that nearly
touched your master's honour 
 i would say replied graeme that
he did ill to slander the absent and that my
vol lu e
 the abbot
master was a man who could render an account
 his actions to any one who should
manfully demand it him to his face
and it were manfully said replied the
regent what thinks thou my lord 
morton 
 i think replied morton that if the
young galliard resemble a certain ancient
friend ours as much in the craft his
disposition as he does in eye and in brow
there may be a wide difference betwixt
what he means and what he speaks
 and whom meanest thou that he resembles
so closely said murray
even the true and trusty julian 
replied morton
 but this youth belongs to the debateable
land said murray
 it may be so but julian was an outlying
striker venison and made many a
far cast when he had a fah doe in chase
 pshaw said the regent this is but
idle talk here thou hyndman thou curiosity
 conduct this youth to his compare
abbot 
non you will both he said to graeme
 keep yourselves in readiness to travel on
short notice and then motioning to him
courteously to withdraw he broke up the
interview
 the abbot
chapter 
it is and is not tis the thing i sought for
have kneel'd for pray'd for risk'd my fame and life for
and yet it is not no more than the shadow
upon the hard cold flat and polish'd mirror
is the warm graceful rounded living substance
which it presents in form and lineament
old plain
the usher with gravity which ill concealed
a jealous scowl conducted roland
graeme to a lower apartment where he
found his comrade the falconer the man
 office then briefly acquainted them that
this would be their residence till his grace's
further orders that they were to go to the
pantry to the buttery to the cellar and to
the kitchen at the usual hours to receive
the allowances becoming their station
instructions which adam woodcock's old
familiarity with the court made him perfectthe
abbot 
ly understand for your beds he said
you must go to the hostelry saint michael's
in respect the palace is now full 
the domestics the greater nobles
no sooner was the usher's back turned
than adam exclaimed with all the glee 
eager curiosity and now master roland
the news the news come unbutton
thy pouch and give us thy tidings what
says the regent asks he for adam woodcock
 and is all soldered up or must the
abbot unreason strap for it 
all is well in that quarter said the
page and for the rest but heyday
what have you taken the chain and medal
off from my bonnet 
 and meet time it was when yon usher
vinegarfaced rogue that he is began to
enquire what popish trangam you were
wearing by the mass the metal would
have been confiscated for consciencesake
like your other rattle trap yonder at 
which mrs lilies bears about on her
shoes in the guise a pair shoebuckles
 the abbot
this comes carrying popish nicknames
about you
 time jade exclaimed roland graeme
 has she melted down my rosary into
buckles for her clumsy hoofs which will
become such a garnish well nigh as well asa
cow's might but hang her let her keep
them many a dog's trick have i played
old lilies for want having something
better to do and the buckles will serve fora
remembrance do you remember the
verjuice i put into the comfits when old
wingate and she were to breakfast together
on easter morning 
in troth do i master roland the
majordomo's mouth was as crooked as a
hawk's beak for the whole morning afterward
and any other page in your room
would have tasted the discipline the
porter's lodge for it but my lady's favour
stood between your skin and many a jerking
 lord send you may be the better for
her protection in such matters
the abbot 
i am at least grateful for it adam 
and i am glad you put me in mind it
well but the news my young master
said woodcock spell me the tidings 
what are we to fly at next what did the
regent say to you f
nothing that i am to repeat again said
koland graeme shaking his head
why heyday said adam how prudent
we are become ail a sudden you
have advanced rarely in brief space master
roland you have well nigh had your
broken head and you have gained your
gold chain and you have made an enemy
master usher to wit with his two legs like
hawk's perches and you have had audience
 the first man in the realm and bear as
much mystery in your brow as if you had
flown in the courtsky ever since you were
hatched i believe in my soul you would
run with a piece the eggshell on your
head like the purlieus whom i would we
were after them again we used to call
whaup in the halidome and its neighbourhood
the abbot
hood but sit thee down boy adam
woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter
into forbidden secrets sit thee down
and i will go fetch the vivers i know the
butler and the panther old
the goodnatured falconer set forth upon
his errand busying himself about procuring
their refreshment and during his absence
roland graeme abandoned himself to the
strange complicated and yet heartstirring
reflections to which the events the morning
had given rise yesterday he was 
neither mark nor likelihood a vagrant boy
the attendant on a relative whose sane
judgment he himself had not the highest
opinion but now he had become he
knew not why or wherefore or to what
extent the custodier as the scottish phrase
went some important state secret in the
safe keeping which the regent himself
was concerned it did not diminish from
but rather added to the interest a situation
so unexpected that roland himself
did not perfectly understand wherein he
the abbor 
stood committed by the state secrets in
which he had unwittingly become participator
on the contrary he felt like one who
looks on a romantic landscape which
he sees the features for the first time and
then obscured with mist and driving tempest
the imperfect glimpse which the eye
catches rocks trees and other objects
around him adds double dignity to these
shrouded mountains and darkened abysses
 which the height depth and extent are
left to imagination
but mortals especially at the well appetite
age which precedes twenty years are
seldom so much engaged either by real or
conjectural subjects speculation but
what their earthly wants claim their hour
 attention and with many a smile did
our hero so the reader may term him if he
will hail the reappearance his friend
adam woodcock bearing on one wooden
platter a tremendous portion boiled beef
and on another a plentiful allowance 
 the abbot
greens or rather what the scotch call langkail
a groom followed with bread salt
and the other means setting forth a meal 
and when they had both placed on the oaken
table what they bore in their hands the falconer
observed that since he knew the court
it had got harder and harder every day to
the poor gentlemen and yeomen retainers
but that now it was an absolute flaying a
flea for the hide and tallow such thronging
to the wicket and such churlish answers
and such bare beefbones such a
shouldering at the butteryhatch and cellarage
and nought to be gained beyond small
insufficient single ale or at best with a single
strike malt to counterbalance a double
allowance water by the mass
though my young friend said he while he
saw the food disappearing fast under roland's
active exertions it is not so well to
lament for former times as to take the advantage
 the present else we are like to
lose on both sides
so saying adam woodcock drew his
the abbot 
chair towards the table unsheathed his
knife for every one carried that minister 
festive distribution for himself and imitated
his young companion's example who for the
moment had lost his anxiety for the future
in the eager satisfaction an appetite sharpened
by youth and abstinence
in truth they made though the materials
were sufficiently simple a very respectable
meal at the expence the royal allowance
and adam woodcock notwithstanding the
deliberate censure which he had passed on
the household beer the palace had taken
the fourth deep draught the black jack
ere he remembered him that he had spoken
in its dispraise flinging himself jollily and
luxuriously back in an old danse elbow
chair and looking with a careless glee
towards the page extending at the same
time his right leg and stretching the other
easily over it he reminded his companion
that he had not yet heard the ballad which
he had made for the abbot unreason's
 the abbot
revel and accordingly he struck merrily
up with
the pope that pagan full pride
has blinded us full lang
roland grasme who felt no great delight
as may be supposed in the falconer's
satire considering its subject began to
snatch up his mantle and fling it around his
shoulders an action which instantly interrupted
the ditty adam woodcock
 where the vengeance are you going
now he said thou restless boy thou
hast quicksilver in the veins thee to a
certainty and can'st no more abide any
douce and sensible communing than a
bootless hawk would keep perched on ray
wrist 
 why adam replied the page if
you must needs know i am about to take
a walk and look at this fair city one mayas
well be still mewed up in the old castle
 the lake if one is to sit the livelong night
between four stone walls and hearken to
old ballads
the abbot 
it is a new ballad the lord help thee
replied adam and that one the best
that ever was matched with a rousing chorus

 be it so said the page i will hear
it another day when the rain is dashing
against the windows and there is neither
steed stamping nor spur jingling nor feather
waving in the neighbourhood to mar
my marking it well but even now i want
to be in the world and to look about me
but the never a stride shall you go
without me said the falconer until the
regent shall take you whole and sound off
my hand and so if you will we may goto
the hostelry saint michael's and there
you will see company enough but through
the casement mark you me for as to rambling
through the street to seek seytons
and leslie and having a dozen holes drilled
in your new jacket with rapier and poniard
i will yield no way to it
to the hostelry saint michael's then
with all my heart said the page and they
 the abbot
left the palace accordingly rendered to the
sentinels at the gate who had now taken
their posts for the evening a strict account
 their names and business were dismissed
through a small wicket the closebarred
portal and soon reached the inn or
hostelry saint michael which stood in a
large courtyard off the main street close
under the descent the cantonhill the
place wide waste and uncomfortable resembled
rather an eastern caravansery
where men found shelter indeed but were
obliged to supply themselves with everything
else than one our modern inns 
where not one comfort shall to those be lost
who never ask or never feel the cost
but still to the inexperienced eye roland
greene the bustle and confusion 
this place public resort furnished excitement
and amusement in the large
room into which they had rather found
their own way than been ushered by mine
host travellers and natives the city enthe
abbot hi
tered and departed met and greeted gamed
or drank together regardless each other's
presence forming the strongest contrast to
the stern and monotonous order and silence
with which matters were conducted
in the wellordered household the knight
 avenel altercation every kind from
brawling to jesting was going on amongst
the groupes around them and yet the noise
and mingled voices seemed to disturb no
one and indeed to be noticed by no others
than by those who composed the groupe
to which the speaker belonged
the falconer passed through the apartment
to a projecting latticed window which
formed a sort recess from the room itself
and having here ensconced himself and his
companion he called for some refreshments 
and a tapster after he had shouted for the
twentieth time accommodated him with
the remains a cold capon and a neat's
tongue together with a pewter stoup 
weak french vindespair fetch a stoup
 brandywine thou knave we will be jolly
tonight master roland said he when
 the abbot
he saw himself thus accommodated and
let care come tomorrow
but roland had eaten too lately to enjoy
the good cheer j and feeling his curiosity
much sharper than his appetite he made
it his choice to look out the lattice which
overhung a large yard surrounded by the
stables the hostelry and fed his eyes on
the busy sight beneath while adam woodcock
after he had compared his companion
to the laird macfarlane's geese who
liked their play better than their meat
disposed his time with the aid cup and
trencher occasionally humming the burthen
 his birth strangled ballad and beating
time to it with his fingers on the little
round table in this exercise he was frequently
interrupted by the exclamations 
his companion as he saw something new in
the yard beneath to attract and interest
him
it was a busy scene for the number gentlemen
and nobles who were now crowded
into the city had filled all spare stables and
places public reception with their horses
the abbot 
and military attendants there were some
score yeomen dressing their own or their
masters horses in the yard whistling singing
laughing and upbraiding each other ina
style wit which the good order avenel
castle rendered strange to roland grasme's
ears others were busy repairing their own
arms or cleaning those their masters one
fellow having just bought a bundle twenty
spears was sitting in a corner employed
in painting the white handles the weapons
with yellow and vermillion other
lacqueys led large staghounds or wolfdogs
 noble race carefully muzzled to
prevent accidents to passengers all came
and went mixed together and separated
under the delighted eye the page whose
imagination had not even conceived a scene
so gaily diversified with the objects he had
most pleasure in beholding j so that he was
perpetually breaking the quiet reverie honest
woodcock and the mental progress
which he was making in his ditty by exclaiming
 look here adam look at the bonny
 the abbot
bay horse saint anthony what a gallant
forehand he hath got and see the goodly
grey which yonder fellow in the friezejacket
is dressing as awkwardly as if he had
never touched aught but a cow i would i
were nigh him to teach him his trade 
and lo you adam the gay milan armour
that the yeoman is scouring all steel and
silver like our knight's prime suit which
old wingate makes such account and see
to yonder pretty wench adam who comes
tripping through them all with her milkpail
 i warrant me she has had a long walk
from the loaning she has a stammel waistcoat
like your favourite cissy sunderland
master adam
by my hood lad answered the falconer
 it is well for thee thou wert brought
up where grace grev even in the castle
 avenel thou wert a wildblood enough
but hadst thou been nurtured here within
a flightshot the court thou hadst been
the veriest crackhemp a page that ever
wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy
the abbot 
side truly i wish it may well with
thee
 nay but leave thy senseless humming
and drumming old adam and come to the
window ere thou hast drenched thy senses
in the pintpot there see here comes a
merry minstrel with his crowd and a wench
with him that dances with bells at her ancles
 and see the yeomen and pages leave
their horses and the armour they were
cleaning and gather round as is very natural
to hear the music come old adam
we will thither too
 you shall call me cut if i do go down
said adam you are near as good minstrelsy
as he can make if you had the grace
to listen to it
 but the wench in the stammel waistcoat
is stopping too adam by heaven
they are going to dance frieze jacket
wants to dance with stammelwaistcoat but
she is coy and recusant
then suddenly changing his tone levity
into one deep interest and surprise
 the abbot
he exclaimed queen heaven what
is it that i see and then remained silent
the sage adam woodcock who was ina
sort languid degree amused with the
page's exclamations even while he professed
to despise them became at length rather
desirous to set his tongue once more going
that he might enjoy the superiority afforded
by his own intimate familiarity withall
the circumstances which excited in his
young companion's mind so much wonderment

well then he said at last what is it
you do see master roland that you have
become mute all a sudden 
roland returned no answer
i say master roland greene said the
falconer it is manners in my country fora
man to speak when he is spoken to
roland graeme remained silent
 the murrain is in the boy said adam
woodcock he has stared out his eyes and
talked his tongue to pieces i think
the falconer hastily drank off his can 
the abbot 
wine and came to roland who stood like
a statue with his eyes eagerly bent on the
courtyard though adam woodcock was
unable to detect amongst the merry scene
which it exhibited aught that could deserve
such devoted attention
the lad is mazed said the falconer
to himself
but roland greene had good reasons for
his surprise though they were not such ashe
could communicate to his companion
the touch the old man's instrument
for he had already begun to play had
drawn in several auditors from the street
when one entered the gate the yard
whose appearance exclusively arrested the
attention roland graeme he was 
his own age or a good deal younger and
from his dress and bearing might be the
same rank and calling having all the air 
coxcombry and pretension which accorded
with a handsome though slight and low figure
and an elegant dress in part hid by
a large purple cloak as he entered he
 the abbot
cast a glance up towards the windows and
to his extreme astonishment under the
purple velvet bonnet and white feather
roland recognized the features so deeply
impressed on his memory the bright and
clustered tresses the laughing full blue
eyes the well formed eyebrows the nose
with the slightest possible inclination to be
aquiline the ruby lip which an arch and
half suppressed smile seemed the habitual
expression in short the form and face 
catherine sey ton in man's attire however
and mimicking as it seemed not unsuccessfully
the bearing a youthful but forward
page
saint george and saint andrew said
the astonished roland graeme to himself
 was there ever such an audacious quean 
she seems a little ashamed her mummery
too for she holds the lap her cloak
to her fac and her colour is heightened 
but santa maria how she threads the
throng with as firm and bold a step as
if she had never tied petticoat round her
the abbot 
waist holy saints she holds up her ridingrod
as if she would lay it about some 
their ears that stand most in her way by
the hand my father she bears herself
like the very model pagehood hey 
what sure she will not strike friezejacket
in earnest but he was not long left in
doubt for the lout whom he had before repeatedly
noticed standing in the way the
bustling page and maintaining his place
with clownish obstinacy or stupidity the
advanced ridingrod was without a moment's
hesitation sharply applied to his
shoulders in a manner which made him
spring aside rubbing the part the body
which had received so unceremonious a
hint that it was in the way his betters
the party injured growled forth an oath or
two indignation and roland grasme
began to think flying down stairs to the
assistance the translated catherine j but
the laugh the yard was against friezejacket
which indeed had in these days
 the abbor
small chance fair play in a quarrel with velvet
and embroidery so that the fellow who
was a menial in the inn slunk back to finish
his task dressing the bonny grey laughed
at by all but most by the wench in the
stammel waistcoat his fellow servant who
to crown his disgrace had the cruelty to
cast an applauding smile upon the author
 the injury while with a freedom more
like the milkmaid the town than she 
the plains she accosted him with is
there any one you want here my pretty
gentleman that you seem in such haste 
i seek a sprig a lad said the seeming
gallant with a sprig holly in his
cap black hair and black eyes green jacket
and the air a country coxcomb i have
sought him through every close and alley
in the canongate the fiend gore him 
 why goda mercy nun muttered
roland greene much bewildered
i will enquire him presently out for your
fair young worship said the wench the
inn
the abbot 
do said the gallant squire and if
you bring me to him you shall have a groat
tonight and a kiss on sunday when you
have on a cleaner kirtle
why godmercy nun again muttered
roland this is a note above e la
in a moment after the servant entered
the room and ushered in the object his
surprise
while the disguised vestal looked with
unabashed brow and bold and rapid glance
 her eye through the various parties in
the large old room roland greeme who
felt an internal awkward sense bashful
confusion which he deemed altogether unworthy
 the bold and dashing character
to which he aspired determined not to be
browbeaten and put down by this singular
female but to meet her with a glance 
recognition so sly so penetrating so expressively
humorous as should shew her at
once he was in possession her secret and
master her fate and should compel her
vol f
 the abbot
to humble herself towards him at least into
the look and manner respectful and deprecating
observance
this was extremely well planned but
just as roland had called up the knowing
glance the suppressed smile the shrewd
intelligent look which was to ensure his
triumph he encountered the bold firm and
steady gaze his brother or sisterpage
who casting on him a falcon glance and
recognizing him at once as the object 
his search walked up with the most unconcerned
look the most free and undaunted
composure and hailed him with you sir
holly top i would speak with you
the steady coolness and assurance with
which these words were uttered although
the voice was the very voice he had heard
at the old convent and although the features
more nearly resembled those catherine
when seen close than when viewed
from a distance produced nevertheless
such a confusion in roland's mind that he
became uncertain whether he was not still
the abbot 
under a mistake from the beginning the
knowing shrewdness which should have
animated his visage faded into a sheepish
bashfulness and the halfsuppressed but
most intelligible smile became the senseless
giggle one who laughs to cover his
own disorder ideas
 do they understand a scotch tongue
in thy country holytop said this marvellous
specimen metamorphosis i
said i would speak with thee
 what is your business with my comrade
my young chick the game said
adam woodcock willing to step in to his
companion's assistance though totally at a
loss to account for the sudden disappearance
 all roland's usual smartness and
presence mind
 nothing to you my old cock the
perch replied the gallant go mind your
hawk's castings i guess by your bag and
your gauntlet that you are squire the
body to a sort kites
he laughed as he spoke and the laugh
 the abbot
reminded roland so irresistibly the
hearty fit risibility in which catherine
had indulged at his expence when they first
met in the old nunnery that he could scarce
help exclaiming catherine seyton by
heavens he checked the exclamation
however and only said i think sir we
two are not totally strangers to each other
 we must have met in our dreams then
said the youth and my days are too busy
to remember what i think at nights
 or apparently to remember upon one
day those whom you may have seen on the
preceding eve said roland graeme
the youth in his turn cast on him a look
 some surprise as he replied i know
no more what you mean than does the
horse i ride on if there be offence in your
words you shall find me as ready to take it
as any lad in lothian
you know well said roland though
if it pleases you to use the language a
stranger that with you i can have no purpose
to quarrel
the abbot 
let me do mine errand then and be
rid you said the page step hither
this way out that old leathern fist's hearing

they walked into the recess the window
which roland had left upon theyouth's
entrance into the apartment the messenger
then turned his back on the company
after casting a hasty and sharp glance around
to see if they were observed roland did
the same and the page in the purple mantle
thus addressed him taking at the same
time from under his cloak a short but beautifully
wrought sword with the hilt and ornaments
upon the sheath silver massively
chased and over gilded i bring you
this weapon from a friend who gives it you
under the solemn condition that you will
not unsheathed it until you are commanded
by your rightful sovereign for your
warmth temper is known and the presumption
with which you intrude yourself
into the quarrels others and therefore
this is laid upon you as a penance by those
 the abbot
who wish you well and whose hand will influence
your destiny for good or for evil
this is what i was charged to tell you soif
you will give a fair word for a fair sword
and pledge your promise with hand and
glove good and well and if not i will carry
back caliban to those who sent it
 and may i not ask who these areas
said roland gramme admiring at the same
time the beauty the weapon thus offered
him
 my commission in no way leads me
to answer such a question said he the
purple mantle
 but if i am offended said roland
 may i not draw to defend myself
 not this weapon answered the swordbearer
 but you have your own at command
and besides for what do you wear
your poniard 
 for no good said adam woodcock
who had now approached close to them 
 and that i can witness as well as any one
 stand back fellow said the messenger 
the abbot 
thou hast an intrusive curious face that
will come by a buffet if it is found where it
has no concern
 a buffet my young master malapert
said adam drawing back however best
keep down fist or by our lady buffet will
beget buffet 
be patient adam woodcock said
roland greene and let me pray you
fair sir since by such addition you chuse
for the present to be addressed may i not
barely unsheathed this fair weapon in pure
simplicity desire to know whether so
fair a hilt and scabbard are matched with a
befitting blade 
 by no manner means said the messenger
 at a word you must take it under
the promise that you never draw it until
you receive the commands your lawful
sovereign or you must leave it alone
 under that condition and coming from
your friendly hand i accept the sword
said roland taking it from his hand but
credit me that if we are to work together
in any weighty emprise as i am induced to
 the abbot
believe some confidence and openness on
your part will be necessary to give the right
impulse to my zeal i press for no more at
present it is enough that you understand
me
i understand you said the page exhibiting
the appearance unfeigned surprise
in his turn renounce me if do
here you stand suggesting and smuggling
and looking cunning as if there were some
mighty matter intrigue and common understanding
betwixt you and me whom
you never set your eyes on before 
 what said roland graeme will
you deny that we have met before 
marry that i will in any christian
court said the other page
and will you also deny said roland
 that it was recommended to us to study
each other's features well that in whatsoever
disguise the time might impose upon us
each should recognize in the other the secret
agent a mighty work do not you
remember that sister magdalen and dame
bridget
the abbot 
the messenger here interrupted him
shrugging up his shoulders with a look 
compassion bridget and magdalen why
this is madness and dreaming hark ye
master holly top your wits are gone on
woolgathering comfort yourself with a
caudle thatch your brainsick noddle with
a woollen night cap and so god be with
you
as he concluded this polite parting address
adam woodcock who was again
seated by the table on which stood the now
empty can said to him will you drink
a cup young man in the way courtesy
now you have done your errand and listen
a good song and without waiting for an
answer he commenced his ditty 
the pope that pagan full prideshath
blinded us full long
it is probable that the good wine had made
some innovation in the falconer's brain
otherwise he would have recollected the
danger introducing any thing like political
or polemical pleasantry into a public
f 
 the abbot
assemblage at a time when men's minds
were in a state great irritability todo
him justice he perceived his error and
stopped short so soon as he saw that the
word pope had at once interrupted the separate
conversations the various parties
which were assembled in the apartment 
and that many began to draw themselves
up bridle look big and prepare to take
part in the impending brawl while others
more decent and cautious persons hastily
paid down their laying and prepared ta
leave the place ere bad should come to
worse
and to worse it was soon likely to come 
for no sooner did woodcock's ditty reach
the ear the stranger page than uplifting
his ridingrod he exclaimed he who
speaks irreverently the holy father 
the church in my presence is the cub a
heretic wolfbitch and i will switch him as
i would a mongrel cur
and i will break thy young pate said
adam if thou dearest to lift a finger to
the abbot 
me and then in defiance the young
drawcansir's threats with a stout heart and
dauntless accent he again uplifted the stave
 the pope that pagan full pride
hath blinded
bat adam was able to proceed no farther
being himself unfortunately blinded
by a stroke the impatient youth's switch
across his eyes enraged at once by the
smart and the indignity the falconer started
up and darkling as he was for his eyes
watered too fast to permit his seeing anything
he would soon have been at close
grips with his insolent adversary had not
roland graeme contrary to his nature played
for once the prudent man and the peacemaker
and thrown himself betwixt them imploring
woodcock's patience you know
not he said with whom you have to do
and thou addressing the messenger who
stood scornfully laughing at adam's rage
 get thee gone whoever thou art j if thou
 the abbot
best what i guess thee thou well knowest
there are earnest reasons why thou shouldst
thou hast hit right for once hollytop
said the gallant though i guess you
drew your bow at a venture here host
let this yeoman have a pottle wine to
wash the smart out his eyes and there
is a french crown for him so saying he
threw the piece money on the table and
left the apartment with a quick yet steady
pace looking firmly at right and left as if
to defy interruption and snapping his fingers
at two or three respectable burghers
who declaring it was a shame that any one
should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence
 the pope were labouring to find
the hilts their swords which had got for
the present unhappily entangled in the
folds their cloaks but as the adversary
was gone ere any them had reached
his weapon they did not think it necessary
to unsheathe cold iron but merely observed
to each other this is more than masterful
violence to see a poor man stricken
the abbot 
in the face just for singing a ballad against
the whore babylon if the popes champions
are to be songsters in our very changehouses
we shall soon have the old shavelines
back again
the provost should look to it said
another and have some five or six armed
with partizans to come in upon the first
whistle to teach these gallants their lesson
forlookyouneighbourlugleatheritisnot
for decent householders like ourselves to be
brawling with the godless grooms and pert
pages the nobles that are bred up to little
else save bloodshed and blasphemy
for all that neighbour said lugleather
 i would have curried that youngster as
properly as ever i curried a lamb's hide had
not the hilt my bilbo been for the instant
beyond my grasp and before i could
turn my girdle gone was my master
ay said the others the devil go
with him and peace abide with us i give
my rede neighbours that we pay the laying
and be stepping homeward like brother
and brother j for old saint giles's is tolling
 the abbot
curfew and the street grows dangerous at
night
with that the good burghers adjusted their
cloaks and prepared for their departure
while he that seemed the briskest the three
laying his hand on his andrea ferrara observed
that they that spoke in praise the
pope on the highgate edinburgh had
best bring the sword saint peter to defend
them
while the illhumour excited by the insolence
 the young aristocrat was thus evaporating
in empty menace roland greene
had to controul the far more serious indignation
 adam woodcock why manit
was but a switch across the mazzard
blow your nose dry your eyes and you will
see all the better for it
by this light which i cannot see said
adam woodcock thou hast been false
friend to me young man neither taking
up my rightful quarrel nor letting me fight
it out myself
 fye for shame adam woodcock replied
the youth determined to turn the tathe
abbot 
bless on him and become in turn the counsellor
 good order and peaceable demeanour
 i say fye for shame alas that
you will speak thus here are you sent
with me to prevent my innocent youth
getting into snares 
 i wish your innocent youth were cut
short with a halter with all my heart said
adam who began to see which way the
admonition tended
 and instead setting before me
continued roland an example patience
and sobriety becoming the falconer sir
halbert glendinning you quaff me off i
know not how many flagons ale besides
a gallon wine and a full measure strong
waters
 it was but one poor pottle said poor
adam whom consciousness now reduced
to a merely defensive warfare
it was enough to pottle you handsomely
however said the page and then
instead going to bed to sleep off your
liquor must you sit singing your roistering
 the abbot
songs about popes and pagans till you have
got your eyes almost switched out your
head and but for my interference whom
your drunken ingratitude accuses deserting
you yon galliard would have cut your
throat for he was whipping out a linger
as broad as my hand and as sharp as a razor
 and these are lessons for an inexperienced
youth oh adam out upon you 
out upon you 
marry amen and with all my heart
said adam out upon my folly for expecting
any thing but impertinent raillery
from a page hke thee that if he saw his father
in a scrape would laugh at him instead
 lending him aid
 nay but i will lend you aid said the
page still laughing that is i will lend thee
aid to thy chamber good adam where thou
shalt sleep off wine and ale ire and indignation
and awake the next morning with as
much fair wit as nature has blessed thee
withal only one thing i will warn thee
good adam that henceforth and for ever
the abbot 
when thou fairest at me for being somewhat
hot at hand and rather too prompt to outwith
poniard or so thy admonition shall
serve as a prologue to the memorable adventure
 the switching saint michael's

with such condoling expressions he got
the crestfallen falconer to his bed and then
retired to his own pallet where it was sometime
ere he could fall asleep if the messenger
whom he had seen were really catherine
seyton what a masculine virago
and termagant must she be and stored
with what an inimitable command insolence
and assurance the brass on her
brow would furbish the front twenty
pages and i should know thought roland
what that amounts to and yet her features
her look her light gait her laughing
eye the art with which she disposed the
mantle to shew no more her limbs than
needs must be seen i am glad she had at
least that grace left the voice the smile
it must have been catherine seyton or
 the abbot
the devil in her likeness one thing is
good i have silenced the eternal predications
 that ass adam woodcock who has
set up for being a preacher and a governor
over me so soon as he has left the hawks
mew behind him
and with this comfortable reflection
joined to the happy indifference which
youth hath for the events the morrow
roland grme fell fast asleep
the abbot 
chapter v
now have you reft from me my staff my guide
who taught my youth as men teach untamed falcons
to use my strength discreetly i am reft
 comrade and counsel
old plain
in the grey the next morning's dawn
there was a loud knocking at the gate 
the hostelry andthose without proclaiming
that they came in the name the regent
were instantly admitted a moment or two
afterwards michael ingthewind stood
by the bedside our travellers
 up up i he said there is no slumber
where murray hath work ado
both sleepers sprung up and began to
dress themselves
you old friend said wing the wind to
adam woodcock must to horse instantly
with this packet to the monks kenna
quhair and with this delivering them a
he spoke to the knight aveneu
 the abbot
 as much as commanding the monks
to annul their election til warrant me 
an abbot quoth adam woodcock as he
put the packets into his bag and charging
my master to see it done to hawk atone
brother with another is less than fair
play methinks
 fash not thy beard about it old boy
said michael but betake thee to the saddle
presently for if these orders are not
obeyed there will be bare walls at the kirk
 saint mary's and it may be at the castle
 avenel to boot for i heard my lord 
morton loud with the regent and we are
at a pass that we cannot stand with him
anent trifles
 but said adam touching the abbot
 unreason what say they to that
outbreak an they be shrewishly disposed
i were better pitch the packets to satan
and take the other side the border
for my bield
 o that is passed over as a jest since
there was little harm done but hark thee
adams continued his comrade if there
the abbot 
was a dozen vacant abbacies in your road
whether jest or earnest reason or unreason
draw thou never one their mitres
over thy brows the time is not fitting
man besides our maiden longs to clip
the neck a fat churchman
 she shall never sheer mine in that capacity
said the falconer while he knotted
the kerchief in two or three double folds
around his sun burnt bullneck calling out
at the same time master roland master
roland make haste we must back to
perch and mew and thank heaven more
than our own wit with our bones whole
and without a stab in the stomach
nay but said wingthewind the
page goes not back with you the regent
has other employment for him
saints and sorrows exclaimed the
falconer master roland grme to remain
here and i to return to avenel 
why it cannot be the child cannot manage
himself in this wide world without me
and i question if he will stoop to any other
 the abbot
whistle than mine own there are times i
myself can hardly bring him to my lure
it was at roland's tongue's to say
something concerning the occasion they
had for using mutually each other's prudence
but the real anxiety which adam
evinced at parting with him took away his
disposition to such ungracious raillery the
falconer did not altogether escape however
for in turning his face towards the lattice
his friend michael caught a glimpse it
and exclaimed i pr'ythee adam woodcock
what hast thou been doing with these
eyes thine they are swelled to the
starting from the hoot 
 nought in the world said he after
casting a deprecating glance at roland
graeme but the effect sleeping in this
d d truckle without a pillow
i why adam woodcock thou art grown
strangely dainty said his old companion 
 i have known thee sleep all night with
no better pillow than a bush ling and
start up with the sun as gregg as a falcon 
and now thine eyes resembles
abbot 

tie was roused from his reverie by michael
wingthewind who reminded him
that it was necessary they should instantly
return to the palace as my lord regent
went to the sessions early in the morning
they went thither accordingly and 
a favourite old domestic who was
admitted nearer to the regent's person and
privacy than many whose posts were more
ostensible soon introduced graeme into a
small matted chamber where he had an
audience the present head the troubled
state scotland the earl murray was
clad in a sadcoloured morninggown with
a cap and slippers the same cloth but
even in this easy dishabille held his sheathed
rapier in his hand a precaution which
he adopted when receiving strangers rather
in compliance with the earnest remonstrances
 his friends and partizans than from
any personal apprehensions his own he
answered with a silent nod the respectful
obeisance the page and took one or two
turns through the small apartment in silence
fixing his keen eye on roland as if
 the abbot
he wished to penetrate into his very soul
at length he broke silence
 your name is i think julian graeme
roland graeme my lord not julian
replied the page
right i was misled by some trick 
my memory roland graeme from the
debateable land roland thou knowest
the duties which belong to a lady's service

i should know them my lord replied
roland having been bred so near the
person my lady avenel but i trust
never more to practise them as the knight
hath promised
be silent young man said the regent
 i am to speak and you to hear and
to obey it is necessary that for some space
at least you shall again enter into the service
 a lady who in rank hath no equal
in scotland and this service accomplished
i give thee my word as knight and prince
that it shall open to you a course ambition
such as may well gratify the aspiring
wishes one whom circumstances entitle
the abbot 
to entertain much higher views than thou
i will take thee into my household and near
to my person or at your own choice will
give you the command a footcompany 
either is a preferment which the proudest
laird in the land might be glad to assure to
a second son
 may i presume to ask my lord said
roland observing the earl paused for a reply
 to whom my poor services are in the
first place destined 
 you will be told hereafter said the
regent and then as if overcoming some
internal reluctance to speak further himself
he added or why should i not myself tell
you that you are about to enter into the
service a most illustrious most unhappy
lady into the service mary scotland

 the queen my lord said the page
unable to repress his surprise
 her who was the queen said
murray with a singular mixture displeasure
and embarrassment in his tone voice
 the abbot
 you must be aware young man that her
son reigns in her stead
he sighed from an emotion partly perhaps
natural and partly assumed
and am i to attend upon her grace in
her place imprisonment my lord again
demanded the page with a straightforward
and hardy simplicity which somewhat disconcerted
the sage and powerful statesman
she is not imprisoned answered murray
angrily j god forbid she should 
she is only sequestrated from state affairs
and from the business the public until
the world be so effectually settled that she
may enjoy her natural and uncontrouled
freedom without her royal disposition being
exposed to the practices wicked and
designing men it is for this purpose he
added that while she is to be furnished
as right is with such attendance as may befit
her present secluded state it becomes
necessary that those placed around her are
persons on whose prudence i can have reliance
you see therefore you are at once
the abbot 
called on to discharge an office most honourable
in itself and so to discharge it that you
may make a friend the regent scotland
thou art i have been told a singularly
apprehensive youth and i perceive by
thy look that thou doest already understand
what i would say on this matter
in this schedule your particular points 
duty are set down at length but the sum
required you is fidelity i mean fidelity
to myself and to the state you are therefore
to watch every attempt which is made
or inclination displayed to open any communication
with any the lords who have
become banders in the west with hamilton
with seyton with fleming or the like
it is true that my gracious sister reflecting
upon the ill chances that have lapped to the
state this poor kingdom from evil counsellors
who have abused her royal nature intime
past hath determined to sequestrate
herself from state affairs in future but it is
our duty as acting for and in name our
infant nephew to guard against the evils
which may arise from any mutation or 
the abbot
collation in her royal resolutions wherefore
it will be thy duty to watch and report
to our lady mother whose guest our sister
is for the present whatever may infer a disposition
to withdraw her person from the
place security in which she is lodged or
to open communication with those without
if however your observation should detect
any thing weight and which may
exceed mere suspicion fail not to send notice
by an especial messenger to me directly
and this ring shall be thy warrant to order
horse and man on such service and
now begone if there be half the wit in thy
head that there is apprehension in thy look
thou fully comprehended all that i would
say serve me faithfully and sure as i am
belted earl thy reward shall be great
roland grace made an obeisance and
was about to depart
the earl signed to him to remain i
have trusted thee deeply he said young
man for thou art the only one her suite
who has been sent to her by my own recommendation
her gentlewomen are her
the abbot 
own nomination it were too hard to have
barred her that privilege though some there
were who reckoned it inconsistent with sure
policy thou art young and handsome
mingle in their follies and see they cover
not deeper designs under the appearance 
female levity if they do mine do thou
countermine for the rest bear all decorum
and respect to the person thy mistress 
she is a princess though a most unhappy
one and hath been a queen though now
alas no longer such pay therefore to
her all honour and respect consistent with
thy fidelity to the king and me and
now farewell yet stay you travel with
lord lindesay a man the old world
rough and honest though untaught see
that thou offend him not for he is not patient
 raillery and thou i have heard art
a crackhalter this he said with a smile
then added i could have wished the lord
lindesay's mission had been entrusted to
some other and more gentle noble
 and wherefore should you wish that
g 
 the abbot
my lord said morton who even then entered
the apartment the council have
decided for the best we have had but too
many proofs this lady's stubbornness 
mind and the oak that resists the sharp
steel axe must be riven with the rugged
iron wedge and this is to be her page 
my lord regent hath doubtless instructed
you young man how you shall guide yourself
in these matters i will add but a little
hint on my part you are going to the castle
 a douglas where treachery never thrives
the first moment suspicion will be the
last your life my kinsman william
douglas understands no raillery and if he
once have cause to think you false you will
waver in the wind from the castle battlements
ere the sun set upon his anger and
is the lady to have an almoner withal 
occasionally douglas said the regent
 it were hard to deny the spiritual
consolation which she thinks essential to
her salvation
 you are ever too softhearted my lord
the abbot 
what a false priest to communicate her
lamentations not only to our friends in
scotland but to the guises to rome to
spain and i know not where 
fear not said the regent we will
take such order that no treachery shall happen

 look to it then said morton you
know my mind respecting the wench you
have consented she shall receive as a 
 one a family which all
others has ever been devoted to her and
inimical to us had we not been wary she
would have been purveyed a page as
much to her purpose as her waiting damsel
i hear a rumour that an old mad romish
pilgrims who passes for at least half a
saint among them was employed to find a
fit subject
 we have escaped that danger at least
said murray and converted it into a point
 advantage by sending this boy glendining's
 and for her waiting damsel you
cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead
 the abbot
 her four noble maries and all their silken
train
 i care not so much for the waiting
maiden said morton but i cannot brook
the cautioner i think priests all persuasions
are much like each other here is
john knox vho made such a noble pullerdown
is ambitious becoming a setter up
and a founder schools and colleges out 
the abbey lands and bishop's rents and
other spoils rome which the nobility 
scotland have won with their sword and
bow and with which he would nowendow
new hives to sing the old drone
 john is a man god said the regent
 and his scheme is a devout imagination

the sedate smile with which this was
spoken left it impossible to conjecture
whether the words were meant in approbation
or in derision the plan the scottish
reformer turning then to roland
graeme as if he thought he had been long
enough a witness this conversation he
the abbot 
bade him get him presently to horse since
my lord lindesay was already mounted
the page made his reverence and left the
apartment
guided by michael wingthewind he
found his horse ready saddled and prepared
for the journey in front the palace porch
where hovered about a score menatarms
whose leader shewed no small symptoms
 surly impatience
is this the jackanapes page for whom
wee have waited this long said he to 
 and my lord ruthven will
reach the castle long before us
michael assented and added that the boy
had been detained by the regent to receive
some parting instructions the leader
made an inarticulate sound in his throat
expressive sullen acquiesence and calling
to one his domestic attendants
 edward said he take the gallant into
your charge and let him speak with no one
else
he then addressed by the title sir
robert an elderly and respectable looking
 the abbot
gentleman the only one the party who
seemed above the rank a retainer or
domestic and observed that they must get
to horse with all speed
during this discourse and while they
were riding slowly along the street the
suburb roland had time to examine more
accurately the looks and figure the baron
who was at their head
lord lindesay the byres was rather
touched than stricken with years his upright
stature and strong limbs still shewed
him fully equal to all the exertions and fatigues
 war his thick eyebrows now
partially grizzled lowered over large eyes
full dark fire which seemed yet darker
from the uncommon depth at which they
were set in his head his features naturally
strong and harsh had their sternness exaggerated
by one or two scars received in battle
these features naturally calculated to
express the harsher passions were shaded by
an open steel cap with a projecting front
but having no visor over the gorget which
fell the black and grizzled beard the grim
the abbot 
old baron and totally hid the lower part
 his face the rest his dress was a loose
buffcoat which had once been lined with
silk and adorned with embroidery but which
seemed much stained with travel and damaged
with cuts received probably in battle
it covered a corslet which had once been
 polished steel fairly gilded but was now
somewhat injured with rust a sword 
antique make and uncommon size framed
to be wielded with both hands a kind 
weapon which was then beginning to go
out use hung from his neck in a baldrick
and was so disposed as to traverse his
whole person the huge hilt appearing over
his left shoulder and the point reaching
well nigh to the right heel and jarring
against his spur as he walked this unwieldy
weapon could only be unsheathed
by pulling the handle over the left should
no human arm was long enough
to draw it in the usual manner the whole
equipment was that a rude warrior negligent
 his exterior even to misanthropic
the abbot
cal sullenness and the short harsh haughty
tone which he used towards his attendants
belonged to the same unpolished character

the personage who rode with lord lindsay
at the head the party was an absolute
contrast to him in manner form
and features his thin and silky hair was
already white though he seemed not above
fortyfive or fifty years old his tone 
voice was soft and insinuating his form
thin spare and bent by a habitual stoop 
his pale cheek was expressive shrewdness
and intelligence his eye was quick
though placid and his whole demeanour
mild and conciliatory he rode an ambling
nag such as were used by ladies clergymen
or others peaceful professions wore
a riding habit black velvet with a cap
and feather the same hue fastened up
by a golden medal and for show and as a
mark rank rather than for use carried a
walking sword as the short light rapiers
were called without any other arms offensive
or defensive
the abbot ll
the party had now quitted the town
and proceeded at a steady trot towards
the westward as they prosecuted their
journey roland graeme would gladly have
learned something its purpose and tendency
but the countenance the personage
next to whom he had been placed in the
train discouraged all approach to familiarity
the baron himself did not look more
grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer
whose grizzly beard fell over his
mouth like the portcullis before the gate 
a castle as if for the purpose preventing
the escape any word which absolute
necessity did not demand the utterance
the rest the train seemed under the
same taciturn influence and journeyed on
without a word being exchanged amongst
them more like a troop carthusian friars
than a party military retainers roland
graeme was surprised at this extremity
 discipline for even in the household
 the knight avenel though somewhat
distinguished for the accuracy with which
 the abbot
decorum was enforced a journey was a pes 
riot licence during which jest and song
and every thing within the iitnits becoming
mirth and pastime was freely permitted
this unusual silence was however sofar
acceptable that it gave him time to
bring any shadow judgment which he
possessed to council on his own situation
and prospects which would have appeared
to any reasonable person in the highest degree
dangerous and perplexing
it was quite evident that he had through
various circumstances not under his own 
controul formed contradictory connexions
with both the contending factions by whose
strife the kingdom was distracted without
being properly an adherent either it
seemed also clear that the same situation in
the household the deposed queen to
which he was now promoted by the influence
 the regent had been destined to
him by his enthusiastic grandmother magdalen
grme for on this subject the words
which morton had dropped had been a ray
the abbot l
 light yet it was no less clear that these
two persons the one the declared enemy
the other the enthusiastic votary the catholic
religion the one at the head the
king's new government the other who regarded
that government as a criminal usurpation
must have required and expected very
different services from the individual whom
they had thus united in recommending it
required very little reflection to foresee that
these contradictory claims on his services
might speedily place him in a situation
where his honour as well as his life might
be endangered but it was not in roland
grasme's nature to anticipate evil before it
came or to prepare to combat difficulties
before they arrived i will see this beautiful
and unfortunate mary stuart said he
 whom we have heard so much and
then there will be time enough to determine
whether i will be kinsman or queensman
none them can say i have given
word or promise to either their factions 
for they have led me up and down like a
 the abbor
blind billy without giving me any light into
what i was to do but it was lucky that
grim douglas came into the regent's closet
this morning otherwise i had never got
free him without plighting my troth todo
all the earl would have me which seemed
after all but foul play to the poor imprisoned
lady to place her page as an espial
on her
skipping thus lightly over a matter 
such consequence the thoughts the hairbrained
boy went a woolgathering after
more agreeable topics now he admired
the gothic towers barnbougle rising
from the seabeaten rock and overlooking
one the most glorious landscapes in scotland
 and now he began to consider what
notable sport for the hounds and the hawks
must be afforded by the variegated ground
over which they travelled and now he
compared the steady and dull trot at which
they were then prosecuting their journey
with the delight sweeping over hill and
dale in pursuit his favourite sports as
the abbot 
under influence these joyous recollections
he gave his horse the spur and made
him execute a gambade he instantly incurred
the censure his grave neighbour who
hinted to him to keep the pace and move
quietly and in order unless he wished such
notice to be taken his eccentric movements
as was likely to be very displeasing
to him
the rebuke and the restraint under which
the youth now found himself brought back
to his recollection his late goodhumoured
and accommodating associate and guide
adam woodcock and from that topic his
imagination made a short flight to avenel
castle to the quiet and unconfined life its
inhabitants the goodness his early protectress
not forgetting the denizens its
stables kennels and hawk mews in a brief
space all these subjects meditation gave
way to the remembrance that riddle 
womankind catherine sey ton who appeared
before the eye his mind now in her
female form now in her male attire now
 the abbot
in both at once like some strange dream
which presents to us the same individual
under two different characters at the same
instant her mysterious present also recurred
to his recollection the sword which
he now wore at his side and which he was
not to draw save by command his legitimate
sovereign but the key this mystery
he judged he was likely to find in the
issue his present journey
with such thoughts passing through his
mind roland graeme accompanied the
party lord lindesay to the queen'sferry
which they passed in vessels that
lay in readiness for them they encountered
no adventure whatsoever in their passages
excepting one horse being lamed in
getting into the boat an incident very common
on such occasions until a few years
ago when the ferry was completely regulated
what was more peculiarly characteristic
 the olden age was the discharge 
a culverin at the party from the battlements
 the old castle rosette on the
the abbot l
tiorth side the ferry the lord which
happened to have some public or private
quarrel with the lord lindesay and took
this mode expressing his resentment
the insult however as it was harmless remained
unnoticed and unavenged nor did
anything else occur worth notice until the
band had come where lochleven spread its
magnificent sheet waters to the beams 
a bright summer sun
the ancient castle which occupies an
island nearly in the centre the lake recalled
to the page that avenel in which
he had been nurtured but the lake was
much larger and adorned with several islets
besides that on which the fortress was situated
 and instead being embosomed in
hills like that avenel had upon the
southern side only a splendid mountainous
screen being the descent one the lomond
hills and on the other was surrounded
by the extensive and fertile plain 
kinross roland grasme looked with some
degree dismay on the watergirdled forts
the abbot
tress which then as now consisted only 
one large donjonkeep surrounded with a
courtyard with two round flankingtowers
at the angles which contained wutliin its
circuit some other buildings inferior
importance a few old trees clustered together
near the castle gave some relief to
the air desolate seclusion but yet the
page while he gazed upon a building so
sequestered could not but feel for the situation
 a captive princess doomed to
dwell there as well as for his own i must
have been born he thought under the star
that presides over ladies and lakes water
for i cannot by any means escape from the
service the one or from dwelling in the
other but if they allow me not the fair
freedom my sport and exercise they shall
find it as hard to confine a wilddrake as a
youth who can swim like one
the band had now reached the edge 
the water and one the party advancing
displayed lord lindesay's pennon waving
it repeatedly to and fro while that baron
the abbot 
himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle
a banner was presently displayed from the
roof the castle in reply to these signals
and one or two figures were seen busied as
if unmooring a boat which lay close to the
islet
it will be some time ere they can reach
us with the boat said the companion 
the lord lindsay should we not do well
to proceed to the town and array ourselves
in some better order ere we appear befores

 you may do as you list sir robert
replied lindesay have neither time nor
temper to waste on such vanities she has
cost me many a hard ride and must not
now take offence at the thread bare cloak
and soiled doublet that i am arrayed in it
is the livery to which she has brought all
scotland
 do not speak so harshly said sir robert
 if she hath done wrong she hath
dearly abed it and in losing all real power
vol n h
 the abbot
one would not deprive her the little external
homage due at once to a lady and a
princess
 i say to you once more sir robert
melville replied lindesay do as you
will for me i am now too old to drink
myself as a gallant to grace the bower 
dames
 the bower dames my lord said
melville looking at the rude old tower
 is it yon dark and grated castle the
prison a captive queen to which you
give so gay a name 
name it as you list replied lindesay 
had the regent desired to send an envoy
capable to speak to a captive queen there
are many gallants in his court who would
have courted the occasion to make speeches
out amadis gaul or the mirror 
knighthood but when he sent blunt old
lindesay he knew he would speak to a misguided
woman as her former misdoings and
her present state render necessary i sought
not this employment it has been thrust
the abbot 
upon me and i will not cumber myself with
more form in the discharge it than needs
must be tacked to such an occupation
so saying lord lindesay threw himself
from horseback and wrapping his ridingcloak
around him lay down at lazy length
upon the sward to await the arrival the
boat which was now seen rowing from the
castle toward the shore sir robert melville
who had also dismounted walked at short
turns to and fro upon the bank his arms
crossed on his breast often looking to the
castle and displaying in his countenance a
mixture sorrow and anxiety the rest
 the party sate like statues on horseback
without moving so much as the points 
their lances which they held upright in the
air
as soon as the boat approached a rude
quay or landingplace near to which they
had stationed themselves lord lindesay
started up from his recumbent posture and
asked the person who steered why he had
 the abbot
not brought a larger boat with him to transport
his retinue
 so please you replied the boatman
because it is the order our lady that
we bring not to the castle more than four
persons
 thy lady is a wise woman said lindsay
 to suspect me treachery or had
i intended it what is to hinder us from
throwing you and your comrades into the
lake and filling the boat with my own fellows

the steersman on hearing this made a
hasty signal to his men to back their oars
and hold oft from the shore which they
were approaching
why thou ass said lindesay thou
didst not think that i meant thy fool's head
serious harm hark thee friend with
fewer than three servants i will go nowhither
sir robert melville will require
at least the attendance one domestic 
and it will be at your peril and your lady's
the abbot 
to refuse us admission come hither as weare
on matters great national concern
the steersman answered with firmness
but with great civ ility expression that his
orders were positive to bring no more than
four into the island but he offered to row
back to obtain a revisal his orders
 do so my friend said sir robert melville
after he had in vain endeavoured to
persuade his stubborn companion to consent
to a temporary abatement his train
row back to the castle sith it will be no
better and obtain thy lady's orders to transport
the lord lindesay myself and our
retinue hither
and hearken said lord lindesay
take with you this page who comes as an
attendant on your lady's guest dismount
sirrah said he addressing roland and
embark with them in that boat
 and what is to become my horse 
said graeme i am answerable for him to
my master
 will relieve you the charge said
 the abbot
lindesay thou wilt have little enow todo
with horses for ten years to come
 if i thought so said roland but he
was interrupted by sir robert melville
who said to him goodhumouredly dispute
it not young friend resistance can
do no good but may well run thee into
danger
roland greene felt the justice what
he said and though neither delighted with
the matter nor manner lindesay's address
deemed it best to submit to necessity
and to embark without further remonstrance
the men plied their oars the
quay with the party horse stationed near
it receded from the page's eyes the castle
and the islet seemed to draw near in the
same proportion and in a brief space he
landed under the shadow a huge old tree
which overhung the landingplace the
steersman and graeme leaped ashore the
boatmen remained lying on their oars ready
for further service

chapter 
could valour aught avail or people's love
france had not wept navarre's brave henry slain 
if wit or beauty could compassion move
the rose scotland had not wept in vain
elegy in a royal mausoleum lewis
at the gate the courtyard lochleven
appeared the stately form the
lady lochleven a female whose early
charms had captivated james v by whom
she became mother the celebrated regent
murray as she was noble birth
being a daughter the house mar
and great beauty her intercourse with
james did not prevent her being afterwards
sought in honourable marriage by many
gallants the time among whom she had
 the abbot
preferred sir william douglas cochlea
but well has it been said
sour pleasant vices
are made the whips to scourge us 
the station which the lady cochlea
even now held as the wife a man high
rank and interest and the mother a lawful
family did not prevent her nourishing a
painful sense degradation even while she
was proud the talents the power and the
station her son now prime ruler the
state but still a pledge her illicit intercourse
had james done to her she said
in her secret heart the justice he owed her
she had seen in her son as a source unmixed
delight and unchastened pride the
lawful monarch scotland and one the
ablest who ever swayed the sceptre the
house mar not inferior in antiquity or
grandeur to that drummond would then
have also boasted a queen amongst its
daughters and escaped the stain attached
to female frailty even when it has a royal
lover for its apology while such feelings
the abbot 
preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe
they had a corresponding effect on her
countenance where with the remains 
great beauty were mingled traits indicative
 inward discontent and peevish melancholy
it perhaps contributed to increase
this habitual temperament that the lady
loehleven had adopted uncommonly rigid
and severe views religion imitating in
her ideas reformed faith the very worst
errors the catholics in limiting the benefit
 the gospel to those who profess their
own speculative tenets
in every respect the unfortunate queen
mary's now the compulsory guest or rather
prisoner this sullen lady was obnoxious
to her hostess lady loehleven disliked
her as the daughter mary guise the
legal possessor those rights over james's
heart and hand which she conceived herself
to have been injuriously deprived and
yet more so as the professor a religion
which she detested worse than paganism
such was the dame who with stately
 the abbot
mien and sharp yet handsome features
shrouded by her black velvet coif interrogated
the domestic who steered her barge
to the shore what had become lindesay
and sir robert melville the man related
what had passed and she smiled scornfully
as she replied fools must be flattered
not fought with row back make thy
excuse as thou canst say lord ruthven
hath already reached this castle and that he
is impatient for lord lindesay's presence
away with thee randal yet stay what
galopin is that thou hast brought hither 
 so please you my lady he is the page
who is to wait upon 
 ay the new male minion said the
lady lochleven j the female attendant
arrived yesterday i shall have a wellordered
house with this lady and her retinue 
but i trust they will soon find some others
to undertake such a charge begone randal
 and you to roland graeme follow
me to the garden
she led the way with a slow and stately
the abbot 
step to the small garden which enclosed
by a stone wall ornamented with statues
and an artificial fountain in the centre
extended its dull parterres on the side 
the courtyard with which it communicated
by a low and arched portal within the narrow
circuit its formal and limited walks
mary stuart was now learning to perform
the weary part a prisoner which with
little interval she was doomed to sustain
during the remainder her life she was
followed in her slow and melancholy exercise
by two female attendants but in the
first glance which roland greene bestowed
upon one so illustrious by birth so distinguished
by her beauty accomplishments
and misfortunes he was sensible the
presence no other than the unhappy
queen scotland
her face her form have been so deeply
impressed upon the imagination that even at
the distance nearly three centuries it is unnecessary
to remind the most ignorant and
uninformed reader the striking traits which
 the abbot
characterize that remarkable countenance
which seems at once to combine our ideas 
the majestic the pleasing and the brilliant
leaving us to doubt whether they express
most happily the queen the beauty or the
accomplished woman who is there at the
very mention mary stuart's name that
has not her countenance before him familiar
as that the mistress his youth or
the favourite daughter his advanced age 
even those who feel themselves compelled
to believe all or much what her enemies
laid to her charge cannot think without
a sigh upon a countenance expressive
 anything rather than the foul crimes
with which she was charged when living
and which still continue to shade if not
to blacken her memory that brow so
truly open and regal those eyebrows so
regularly graceful which yet were saved
from the charge regular insipidity by
the beautiful effect the hazel eyes which
they overarched and which seem to utter
a thousand histories the nose with
the abbot 
all its grecian precision outline the
mouth so well proportioned so sweetly
formed as if designed to speak nothing but
what was delightful to hear the dimpled
chin the stately swanhke neckform a countenance
the like which we know not to
have existed in any other character moving
in that high class life where the actresses
as well as the actors command general
and undivided attention it is in vain
to say that the portraits which exist this
remarkable woman are not like each other 
for amidst their discrepancy each possesses
general features which the eye at once acknowledges
as peculiar to the vision which
our imagination has raised while we read
her history for the first time and which
has been impressed upon it by the numerous
prints and pictures which we have
seen indeed we cannot look on the worst
 them however deficient in point execution
without saying that it is meant for
queen mary and no small instance it is
 the power beauty that her charms
 the abbot
should have remained the subject not merely
 admiration but warm and chivalrous
interest after the lapse such a length
 time we know that by far the most
acute those who in latter days have
adopted the unfavourable view mary's
character longed like the executioner before
his dreadful task was performed to kiss
the fair hand her on whom he was about
to perform so horrible a duty
dressed then in a deep mourning robe
and with all those charms face shape and
manner with which faithful tradition has
made each reader familiar mary stuart advanced
to meet the lady lochleven who
on her part endeavoured to conceal dislike
and apprehension under the appearance 
respectful indifference the truth was that
she had experienced repeatedly the queen's
superiority in that species disguised yet
cutting sarcasm with which women can successfully
avenge themselves for real and
substantial injuries it may be well doubted
whether this talent was not as fatal to
the abbot 
its possessor as the many others enjoyed by
that highly gifted but most unhappy female
for while it often afforded her a momentary
triumph over her keepers it failed not to
exasperate their resentment and the satire
and sarcasm in which she had indulged
where frequently retaliated by the deep and
bitter hardships which they had the power
 inflicting it is well known that her
death was at length hastened by a letter
which she wrote to queen elizabeth in
which she treated her jealous rival and the
countess shrewsbury with the keenest
irony and ridicule
as the ladies met together the queen
said bending her head at the same time in
return to the obeisance the lady lochleven
 we are this day fortunate we
enjoy the company our amiable hostess
at an unusual hour and during a period
which we have hitherto been permitted to
give to our private exercise but our good
hostess knows well she has at all times access
to our presence and need not observe
 the abbot
the useless ceremony requiring our permission

i am sorry my presence is deemed an
intrusion by your grace said the lady
 lochleven i came but to announce
the arrival an addition to your train
motioning with her hand towards roland
graeme a circumstance towards which
ladies are seldom indifferent
 o i crave your ladyship's pardon 
and am bent to the earth with obligation for
the kindness my nobles or my sovereigns
shall i call them who have permitted me
such a respectable addition to my personal
retinue
they have indeed studied madam
said the lady lochleven to shew their
kindness toward your grace something at
the risk perhaps sound policy and i trust
their doings will not be misconstrued
impossible said the queen the
bounty which permits the daughter so
many kings and who yet is queen the
the abbot 
realm the attendance two waiting women
and a boy is a grace which mary stuart can
never sufficiently acknowledge why my
train will be equal to that any countrydame
in this your kingdom fife saving
but the lack a gentlemanusher and two
blue coated servingmen but i must not
forget in my selfish joy the additional trouble
and charges to which this augmentation
 our train will put our kind hostess and
the whole house lochleven it is this
i am aware which clouds your brows my
worthy lady but be good cheer the
crown scotland has many a fair manor
and your affectionate son and my no less
affectionate brother will endow the good
knight your husband with the best them
ere mary should be dismissed from this hospitable
castle from your ladyship's lack 
means to support the charges
the douglass lochleven madam
answered the lady have known for ages
how to discharge their duty to the state
 the abbot
without looking for reward even when the
task was both irksome and dangerous
nay but my dear lochleven said the
queen you are over scrupulous i pray
you accept a goodly manor what should
support the queen scotland in this her
princely court saving her own crown lands
and who should minister to the wants 
a mother save an affectionate son like the
earl murray who possesses so wonderfully
both the power and inclination or
said you it was the danger the task which
clouded your smooth and hospitable brow 
no doubt a page is a formidable addition
to my bodyguard females and i bethink
me it must have been for that reason
that my lord lindesay refused even now
to venture within the reach a force so
formidable without being attended by a
competent retinue
the lady lochleven started and looked
something surprised and mary suddenly
changing her manner from the smooth ironthe
abbot 
ital affectation mildness to an accent 
austere command and drawing up at the
same time her fine person said with the full
majesty her rank yes lady lochleven
 i know that ruthven is already in
the castle and that lindesay waits on the
bank the return your barge to bring him
hither along with sir robert melville for
what purpose do these nobles come and
why am i not in ordinary decency apprized
 their arrival 
 their purpose madam replied the
lady lochleven they must themselves
explain but a formal annunciation were
needless where your grace hath attendants
who can play the espial so well
 alas poor fleming said the queen
turning to the elder the female attendants
 thou wilt be tried condemned and
gib betted for a spy in the garrison because
thou didst chance to cross the great
hall while my good lady lochleven was
parleying at the full pitch her voice with
her pilot randal put black wool in thy
 the abbot
ears girl as you value the wearing them
longer remember in the castle lochleven
ears and tongues are matters not 
use but show merely our good hostess
can hear as well as speak for us all
we excuse your further attendance my
lady hostess she said once more addressing
the object her resentment and
retire to prepare for an interview with our
rebel lords we will use the antichamber
 our sleeping apartment as our hall
 audience you young man she proceeded
addressing roland graeme aid at
once softening the ironical sharpness her
manner into goodhumoured raillery you
who are all our male attendance from our
lord high chamberlain down to our least
galopin follow us to prepare our court
she turned and walked slowly towards
the castle the lady lochleven folded
her arms and smiled in bitter resentment
as she watched her retiring steps
 thy whole male attendance she muttered
repeating the queen's last words
the abbot 
 and well for thee had it been had thy
train never been larger then turning to
roland in whose way she had stood while
making this pause she made room for him
to pass saying at the same time art thou
already evesdropping follow thy mistress
minion and if thou wilt tell her what i have
now said
roland graeme hastened after his royal
mistress and her attendants who had just
entered a posterngate communicating betwixt
the castle and the small garden they
ascended a winding stair as high as the second
storey which was in a great measure
occupied by a suite three rooms opening
into each other and assigned as the dwelling
 the captive princess the outermost
was a small hall or outerroom within
which opened a large parlour and from
that again the queen's bedroom another
small apartment which opened into
the same parlour contained the beds the
gentlewomen in waiting
 the abbot
roland graeme stepped as became his
station into the outermost these apartments
there to await such orders as might
be communicated to him from the grated
window the room he saw lindesay
melville and their followers disembark 
and observed that they were met at the castle
gate by a third noble to whom lindesay
exclaimed in his loud harsh voice my
lord ruthven you have the start us
at this instant the page's attention was
called to a burst hysterical sobs from the
inner apartment and to the hurried ejaculations
 the terrified females which led him
almost instantly to hasten to their assistance
when he entered he saw that the queen
had thrown herself into the large chair
which stood nearest the door and was sobbing
for breath in a strong fit hysterical
affection the elder female supported her
in her arms while the younger bathed her
face with water and with tears alternately
hasten young man said the elder
the abbot 
lady in alarm fly call in assistance she
is swooning 
but the queen ejaculated in a faint and
broken voice stir not i charge you 
call no one to witness i am better i will
recover instantly and indeed with an
effort which seemed like that one struggling
for life she sate up in her chair and
endeavoured to resume her composure
while her features yet trembled with the
violent emotion body and mind which
she had undergone i am ashamed 
my weakness girls she said taking the
hands her attendants j but it is over
and i am mary stuart once more the savage
tone that man's voice my knowledge
 his insolence the name which he
named the purpose for which they come
may excuse a moments weakness and it
shall be a moment's only she snatched
from her head the curch or cap which had
been disordered during her hysterical agoi
ny shook down the thick clustered tresses
 dark brown which had been before 
the abbot
ed under it and drawing her slender fingers
across the labyrinth which they formed
she arose from the chair and stood
like the inspired image a grecian prophetess
in a mood which partook at once
 sorrow and pride smiles and tears
 we are ill appointed she said to meet
our rebel subjects but as far as we may
we will strive to present ourselves as becomes
their queen follow me my maidens
she said what says thy favourite
song my fleming 
my maids come to my dressing bower
and deck my nutbrown hair 
where'er ye laid a plait before
look ye lay ten times mair
alas she added when she had repeated
with a smile these lines an old ballad
 violence has already robbed me the
ordinary decorations my rank and the
few that nature gave me have been destroyed
by sorrow and by fear yet while she
spoke thus she again let her slender fingers
stray through the wilderness the beauties
abbot 
ful tresses which veiled her kingly neck and
swelling bosom as if in her agony mind
she had not altogether lost the consciousness
 her unrivalled charms roland graeme
on whose youth inexperience and ardent
sense what was dignified and lovely the
demeanour so fair and highborn a lady
wrought like the charm a magician stood
rooted to the spot with surprise and interest
longing to hazard his life in a quarrel
so fair as that which mary stuart's must
needs be she had been bred in france 
she was possessed the most distinguished
beauty she had reigned a queen and
a scottish queen to whom knowledge 
character was as essential as the use vital
air in all these capacities mary was
 all women on the earth most alert at
perceiving and using the advantages which
her charms gave her over almost all who
came within the sphere their influence
she cast on roland a glance which might
nave melted a heart stone my poor
boy she said with a feeling partly real
vol n i
 the abbot
partly political thou art a stranger to us
sent to this doleful captivity from the society
 some tender mother or sister or
maiden with whom you had freedom to
tread a gay measure round the may pole i
grieve for you but you are the only male
in my limited household wilt thou obey
my orders 
to the death madam said graeme ina
determined tone
 then keep the door mine apartment
said the queen keep it till they
offer actual violence or till we shall be fitly
arrayed to receive these intrusive visitors

 i will defend it till they pass over my
body said roland graeme any hesitation
which he had felt concerning the line 
conduct he ought to pursue being completely
swept away by the impulse the
moment
 not so my good youth answered mary
 not so command thee if i have
one faithful subject beside me much need
the abbot 
god wot i have to care for his safety
resist them but till they are put to the
shame using actual violence and then
give way i charge you remember my commands
and with a smile expressive at
once favour and authority she turned
from him and followed by her attendants
entered the bedroom
the youngest paused for half a second ere
she followed her companion and made a signal
to roland graeme with her hand he had
been already long aware that this was catherine
seyton a circumstance which could
not much surprise a youth quick intellects
who recollected the sort mysterious discourse
which had passed betwixt the two matrons
at the deserted nunnery and on which
his meeting with catherine in this place
seemed to cast so much light yet such was
the engrossing effect mary s presence that
it surmounted for the moment even the feelings
 a youthful lover and it was not until
catherine seyton had disappeared that
roland began to consider in what relation
 the abbor
they were to stand to each other she held
up her hand to me in a commanding manner
he thought j perhaps she wanted to
confirm my purpose for the execution 
the queen's commands for i think she
could scarce purpose to scare me with the
sort discipline which she administered to
freezejacket and to poor adam woodcock
but we will see to that anon j meantime
let us do justice to the trust reposed
in us by this unhappy queen i think my
lord murray will himself own that it is
the duty a faithful page to defend his lady
against intrusion on her privacy
accordingly he stepped to the little vestibule
made fast with lock and bar the
door which opened from thence to the large
staircase and then sate himself down to attend
the result he had not long to wait
a rude and strong hand first essayed to
lift the latch then pushed and shook the
door with violence and when it resisted his
attempt to open it exclaimed undo the
door there you within 
the abbot 
 why and at whose command said
the page am i to undo the door the
queen scotland 
another vain attempt which made hinge
and bolts jingle shewed that the impatient
applicant without would willingly have entered
without regarding his challenge j but
at length an answer was returned
 undo the door on your peril the lord
lindesay comes to speak with the lady
mary scotland
the lord lindesay as a scottish noble
answered the page must await his
sovereign's leisure
an earnest altercation ensued amongst
those without in which roland distinguished
the remarkably harsh voice lindesay
in reply to sir robert melville who appeared
to have been using some soothing language
 no no no i tell thee no i
will place a petard against the door rather
than be baulked by a profligate woman and
bearded by an insolent footboy
yet at least said melville let me
 the abbot
try fair means in the first instance violence
to a lady would stain your scutcheon
for ever or await till my lord ruthven
comes
 will await no longer said lindesay 
it is high time the business were done
and we on our return to the council but
thou mayest try thy fair play as thou callest
it while i cause my train to prepare
the petard i came hither provided with as
good gunpowder as blew up the kirk 
field
for god's sake be patient said melville
 and approaching the door he said
as speaking to those within let the queen
know that i her faithful servant robert
melville do entreat her for her own sake
and to prevent worse consequence that she
will undo the door and admit lord lindsay
who brings a mission from the council
 state
 i will do your errand to the queen
said the page and report to you her answer

the abbot 
he went to the door the bedchamber
and tapping against it gently it was
opened by the elder lady to whom he communicated
his errand and returned with
directions from the queen to admit sir robert
melville and lord lindesay roland
greene returned to the vestibule and opened
the door accordingly into which the
lord lindesay strode with the air a soldier
who has fought his way into a conquered
fortress j while melville deeply dejected
followed him more slowly
i draw you to witness and to record
said the page to this last that save for
the especial commands the queen i
would have made good the entrance with
my best strength and my best blood against
all scotland
 be silent young man said melville
in a tone grave rebuke add not brands
to dre this is no time to make a flourish
 thy boyish chivalry
 she has not appeared even yet said
lindesay who had now reached the midst

 the abbot
 the parlour or audience room how call
you this trifling 
patience my lord replied sir robert
time presses not and lord ruthven hath
not as yet descended
at this moment the door the inner
apartment opened and queen mary presented
herself advancing with an air peculiar
grace and majesty and seeming totally
unruffled either by the visit or by the
rude manner in which it had been enforced
her dress was a robe black velvet a
small ruff open in front gave a full view
 her beautifully formed chin and neck but
veiled the bosom on her head she wore
a small cap lace and a transparent white
veil hung from her shoulders over the long
black robe in large loose folds so that it
could be drawn at pleasure over the face
and person she wore a cross gold
around her neck and had her rosary gold
and ebony hanging from her girdle she was
closely followed by her two ladies who remained
standing behind her during the conthe
abbot 
terence even lord lindesay though the
rudest noble that rude age was surprised
into something like respect by the unconcerned
and majestic mien her whom
he had expected to find frantic with impotent
passion or dissolved in useless and
vain sorrow or overwhelmed with the fears
likely in such a situation to assail fallen
royalty
 we fear we have detained you my
lord lindesay said the queen while
she curtsied with dignity in answer to his
reluctant obeisance but a female does
not willingly receive her visitors without
some minutes spent at the toilette men
my lord are less dependant on such ceremonies

lord lindsay casting his eye down on
his own travelstained and disordered dress
muttered something a hasty journey and
the queen paid her greeting to sir robert
melville with courtesy and even as
it seemed with kindness there was then
a dead pause during which lindesay 
the abbot
ed towards the door as if expecting with
impatience the colleague their embassy
the queen alone was entirely unembarrassed
and as if to break the silence she addressed
lord lindesay with a glance at the
large and cumbrous sword which he wore
as already mentioned hanging from his
neck
you have there a trusty and a weighty
travelling companion my lord i trust you
expected to meet with no enemy here
against whom such a formidable weapon
could be necessary it is methinks somewhat
a singular ornament for a court
though i am as i well need to be too
much a stuart to fear a sword
 it is not the first time madam replied
lindesay bringing round the weapon
so as to rest its point on the ground and
leaning one hand on the huge crosshandle
it is not the first time that this weapon
has intruded itself into the presence the
house stuart
 possibly my lord replied the queen
the abbot 
 it may have clone service to my ancestors
 your ancestors were men loyalty
 ay madam replied he service it
hath done but such as kings love neither
to acknowledge nor to reward it was the
service which the knife renders to the tree
when trimming it to the quick and depriving
it the superfluous growth rank
and unfruitful suckers which rob it nourishment

 you talk riddles my lord said mary 
i will hope the explanation carries nothing
insulting with it
 you shall judge madam answered
lindesay with this good sword was
archibald douglas earl angus girded
on the memorable day when he acquired
the name bellthereat for dragging from
the presence your greatgrandfather the
third james the race a crew minions
flatterers and favourites whom he hanged
over the bridge lauder as a warning to
such reptiles how they approach a scottish
throne with this same weapon the same
inflexible champion scottish honour and
 the abbot
nobility slew at one blow spent kilspin
die a courtier your grandfather james
the fourth who had dared to speak lightly
 him in the royal presence they fought
near the brook fall and bellthereat
with this blade sheared through the thigh
 his opponent and lopped the limb as
easily as a shepherd's boy slices a twig from
a sapling
 my lord replied the queen reddening
 my nerves are too good to be alarmed
even by this terrible history may i ask
how a blade so illustrious passed from the
house douglas to that lindesay 
methinks it should have been preserved asa
consecrated relique by a family who have
held all that they could do against their
king to be done in favour their country
nay madam said melville anxiously
interfering ask not that question lord
lindesay and you my lord for shame 
for decency forbear to reply to it
 it is time that this lady should hear the
truth replied lindesay
the abbot 
 and be assured that she will be moved
to anger by none that you can tell her my
lord there are cases in which just scorn
has always the mastery over just anger
 then know said lindesay that upon
the field carburyhill when that false
and infamous traitor and murtherer james
sometime earl both well and nicknamed
duke orkney offered to do personal
battle with any the associated nobles
who came to drag him to justice i accepted
his challenge and was by the noble
earl morton gifted with this good sword
that i might therewith fight it out ah so
help me heaven had his presumption been
one grain more or his cowardice one grain
less i should have done such work with
this good steel on his traitorous corpse that
the hounds and carrioncrows should have
found their morsels daintily carved to their
use 
the queen's courage well nigh gave way
to the mention bothwell's name a name
connected with such a train guilt shame
 the abbot
and disaster but the prolonged boast 
lindesay gave her time to rally herself and
to answer with an appearance cold contempt
 it is easy to slay an enemy who
enters not the lists but had mary stuart
inherited her father's sword as well as his
sceptre the boldest her rebels should
not upon that day have complained that
they had no one to cope withal your
lordship will forgive me if i abridge this
conference a brief description a bloody
fight is long enough to satisfy a lady's curiosity
 and unless my lord lindesay has
something more important to tell us than 
the deeds which old bellthereat achieved
and how he would himself have emulated
them had time and tide permitted we will
retire to our private apartment and you
fleming shall finish reading to us yonder
little treatise des rhodomontade espag
nobles
tarry madam said lindesay his complexion
reddening in his turn i know
your quick wit too well old to have sought
the abbot 
an interview that yon might sharpen its
edge at the expence my honour lord
kuthven and myself with sir robert melville
as a concurrent come to your grace
on the part the secret council to tender
to you what much concerns the safety 
your own life and the welfare the state
the secret council said the queen 
by what powers can it subsist or act
while i from whom it holds its character
am here detained under unjust restraint 
but it matters not what concerns the welfare
 scotland shall be acceptable to mary
stuart come from whatsoever quarter it will
and for what concerns her own life she
has lived long enough to be weary it even
at the age twentyfive where is your
colleague my lord why tarries he 
he comes madam said melville and
lord ruthven entered at the instant holding
in his hand a packet as the queen
returned his salutation she became deadly
pale but instantly recovered herself by dint
 strong and sudden resolution just as the
 the abbot
noble whose appearance seemed to excite
such emotions in her bosom entered the
apartment in company with george douglas
the youngest son the knight 
lochleven who during the absence his
father and brethren acted as seneschal 
the castle under the direction the elder
lady lochleven his father's mother
the abbot 
chapter vii
i give this heavy weight from oflpmy heads
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand 
with mine own tears i wash away ray balm
with my own hand i give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
richard 
lord ruthven had the look and bearing
which became a soldier and a statesman
and the martial cast his form and features
procured him the popular epithet 
greysteil by which he was distinguished
by his intimates after the hero a metrical
romance then generally known his dress
which was a buffcoat embroidered had a
half military character but exhibited nothing
 the sordid negligence which distinguished
that lindesay but the son
 an illfated sire and the father a yet
 the abbot
more unfortunate family bore in his look
that cast inauspicious melancholy by
which the physiognomists that time pretended
to distinguish those who were predestined
to a violent and unhappy death
the terror which the presence this
nobleman impressed on the queen's mind
arose from the active share he had borne
in the slaughter david rizzio his father
having presided at the perpetration
 that abominable crime although so weak
from long and wasting illness that he could
not endure the weight his armour having
arisen from a sickbed to commit a
murther in the presence his sovereign
on that occasion his son also had attended
and taken an active part it was little
to be wondered at that the queen
considering her condition when such a
deed horror was acted in her presence
should retain an instinctive terror for the
principal actors in the mulier she returned
however with grace the salutation
 lord ruthven and extended her hand
the abbot 
to george douglas who kneeled and kissed
it with respect the first mark a subject's
homage which roland graeme had seen any
 them render to the captive sovereign she
returned his greeting in silence and there
was a brief pause during which the steward
 the castle a man a sad brow and a severe
eye placed under george douglas's
directions table and writing materials and
the page obedient to his mistress's dumb
signal advanced a large chair to the side on
which the queen stood the table thus forming
a sort bar which divided the queen
and her personal followers from her unwelcome
visitors the steward then withdrew
after a low reverence when he had closed
the door behind him the queen broke silences
with your favour my lords i
will sit my walks are not indeed extensive
enough at present to fatigue me greatly
yet i find repose something more necessary
than usual
she sate down accordingly and shading
her cheek with her beautiful hand looked
 the abbot
keenly and impressively at each the nobles
in turn mary fleming applied her
kerchief to her eyes and catherine seyton
and roland graeme exchanged a glance
which showed that both were too deeply
engrossed with sentiments interest and
commiseration for their royal mistress to
think any thing which regarded themselves

 i wait your business my lords said
the queen after she had been seated for
about a minute without a word being spoken
 i wait your message from those you
call the secret council i trust it is a petition
 pardon and a desire that i will
resume my rightful throne without using
with due severity my right punishing
those vvho have dispossessed me it
madam replied ruthven it is painful
for us to speak harsh truths to a princess
who has long ruled us but we come to
offer not to implore pardon in a word
madam we have to propose to you on the
the abbot 
part the secret council that you sign
these deeds which will contribute greatly
to the pacification the state the advancement
 god's word and the welfare your
own future life
 am i expected to take these fair words
on trust my lord or may i hear the contents
 these reconciling papers ere i am
asked to sign them
 unquestionably madam it is our purpose
and wish you should read what you
are required to sign replied ruthven
 required replied the queen with
some emphasis but the phrase suits well
the matter read my lord
the lord ruthven proceeded to read a
formal instrument running in the queen's
name and setting forth that she had been
called at an early age to the administration
 the crown and realm scotland and had
toiled diligently therein until she was in
body and spirit so wearied out and disgusted
that she was unable any longer to endure
the travail and pain state affairs j and
 the abbot
that since god blessed her with a fair and
hopeful son she was desirous to ensure to
 him even while she yet lived his succession
to the crown which was his by right hereditary
descent wherefore the instrument
proceeded we the motherly affection
we bear to our said son have renounced
and demitted and by these our
letters free good will renounce and demit
the crown government and guiding the
realm scotland in favour our said son
that he may succeed to us as native prince
thereof as much as if we had been removed
by decease and not by our own proper act
and that this demission our royal authority
may have the more full and solemn effect
and none pretend ignorance we give
grant and commit full and free and plain
power to our trusty cousins lord lindesay
 the byres and william lord ruthven
to appear in our name before as many 
the nobility clergy and burgesses as maybe
assembled at stirling and there in our
name and behalf publicly and in their prethe
abbot 
sence to renounce the crown guidance
and government this our kingdom 
scotland
the queen here broke in with an air 
extreme surprise how is this my lords
she said are my ears turned rebels that
they deceive me with sounds so extraordinary
 and yet it is no wonder that having
conversed so long with rebellion they
should now force its language upon my understanding
 say i am mistaken my lords
say for the honour yourselves and
the scottish nobility my right trusty cousins
 lindesay and ruthven two barons
 warlike fame and ancient line have not
sought the prisonhouse their kind mistress
for such a purpose as these words seem
to imply say for the sake honour and
loyalty that my ears have deceived me
 no madam said ruthven gravely
 your ears do not deceive you they deceived
you when they were closed against
the preachers the evangelic and the 
the abbor
nest advice your faithful subjects j and
when they were ever open to flattery 
pickthanks and traitors foreign circulars
and domestic minions the land may no
longer brook the rule one who cannot
rule herself wherefore i pray you to comply
with the last remaining wish your
subjects and counsellors and spare yourself
and us the further agitation matter so
painful
and is this all my loving subjects require
 me my lord said mary in a tone
 bitter irony do they really stint
themselves to the easy boon that i should
yield up the crown which is mine by birthright
to an infant which is scarcely more
than a year old fling down my sceptre
and take up a distaff o no it is too little
for them to ask that other roll parchment
contains something harder to be complied
with and which may more highly tax
my readiness to comply with the petitions
 my lieges
this parchment answered ruthven
the abbot 
in the same tone inflexible gravity and
unfolding the instrument as he spoke is
one by which your grace constitutes your
nearest in blood and the most honourable
and trustworthy your subjects james
earl murray regent the kingdom
during the minority the young king
he already holds the appointment from the
secret council
the queen gave a sort shriek and
clapping her hands together exclaimed
comes the arrow out his quiver out
 my brother's bow alas i looked for
his return from france as my sole at least
my readiest chance deliverance and
yet when i heard that he had assumed the
government i guessed he would shame to
wield it in my name
 i must pray your answer madam said
lord ruthven to the demand the
council
 the demand the council said the
queen say rather the demand a set
vol k
 the abbot
 robbers impatient to divide the spoil
they have seized to such a demand and
sent by the mouth a traitor whose scalp
but for my womanish mercy should long
since have stood on the city gates mary 
scotland has no answer
 i trust madam said lord ruthven
my being unacceptable to your presence
will not add to your obduracy resolution
it may become you to remember that
the death the minion rizzio cost the
house ruthven its head and leader my
father more worthy than a whole province
 such vile sycophants died in exile and
brokenhearted
the queen clasped her hands on her
face and resting her arms on the table
stooped down her head and wept so bitterly
that the tears were seen to find their
way in streams between the white and slender
fingers with which she endeavoured to
conceal them
 my lords said sir robert melville
 this is too much rigour under your
the abbot 
lordships favour we came hither not to revive
old griefs but to find the mode 
avoiding new ones
 sir robert melville said ruthven
we best know for what purpose we were
delegated hither and wherefore you were
somewhat unnecessarily sent to attend us
nay by my hand said lord lindsay
 i know not why we were cumbered
with the good knight unless he comes in
place the lump sugar which pothicars
put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments
to please a froward child a needless
labour methinks where men have the
means to make them swallow the physic
otherwise
 nay my lords said melville rye best
know your own secret instructions i conceive
i shall best obey mine in striving to
mediate between her grace and you
be silent sir robert melville said
the queen arising and her face still glowing
with agitation as she spoke my kerchief
fleming i shame that traitors should
 the abbot
have power to move me thus tell me
proud lords she added wiping away the
tears as she spoke by what earthly warrant
can liege subjects pretend to challenge the
rights an anointed sovereign to throw
off the allegiance they have vowed and to
take avay the crown from the head on
which divine warrant hath placed it 
 madam said ruthven i will deal
plainly with you your reign from the dismal
field pinkieclench when you were
a babe in the cradle till now that ye
stand a grown dame before us hath been
such a tragedy losses disasters civil dissentions
and foreign wars that the like is
not to be found in our chronicles the
french and english have one consent
made scotland the battlefield on which to
fight out their own ancient quarrel for
ourselves every man's hand hath been
against his brother nor hath a year passed
over without rebellion and slaughter exile
 nobles and oppressing the commons
we may endure it no longer and therethe
abbot 
fore as a prince to whom god hath refused
the gift hearkening to wise counsel
and on whose dealings and projects no
blessing hath ever descended we pray you
to give way to other rule and governance
 the land that a remnant may yet be saved
to this distracted realm
 my lord said mary it seems to me
that you fling on my unhappy and devoted
head those evils which with far more justice
 may impute to your own turbulent
wild and untameable dispositionsthe frantic
violence with which you the magnates
 scotland enter into feuds against each
other sticking at no cruelty to gratify your
wrath taking deep revenge for the slightest
offences and setting at defiance those
wise laws which your ancestors made for
staunching such cruelty rebelling against
the lawful authority and bearing yourselves
as if there where no king in the land or rather
as if each were king in his own premises
and now you throw the blame on
 the abbot
me on me whose life has been embittered
 whose sleep has been broken whose
happiness has been wrecked by your dissentions
have i not myself been obliged to
traverse wilds and mountains at the head
 a few faithful followers to maintain peace
and to put down oppression have i not
worn harness on my person and carried
pistols at my saddle j fain to lay aside the
softness a woman and the dignity a
queen that i might show an example to
my followers 
i we grant madam said lindesay rudely
 that the affrays occasioned by your
misgovernment may sometimes have startled
you in the midst a masque or galliard
 or it may be that such may have interrupted
the idolatry the mass or the
jesuitical counsels some french ambassador
but the longest and severest journey
which your grace has taken in my memory
was from hawick to hermitage castle
j and whether it was for the weal the
the abbot sl
state or for your own honour rests with
your grace's conscience
the queen turned to him with inexpressible
sweetness tone and manner and
that engaging look which heaven had assigned
her as if to shew that the choicest
arts to win men's affections may be given
in vain lindesay she said you spoke
not to me in this stern tone and with such
scurril taunt yon fair summer evening when
you and i shot at the butts against the earl
 mar and mary livingstone and won 
them the evening's collation in the privy
garden saint andrews the master 
lindesay was then my friend and vowed
to be my soldier how i have offended the
lord lindesay i know not unless honours
have changed manners
hardhearted as he was lindesay seemed
struck with this unexpected appeal but almost
instantly replied madam it is well
known that your grace could in those days
make fools whomsoever approached you
 the abbot
i pretend not to have been wiser than
others but gayer men and better courtiers
soon jostled aside my rude homage and i
think your grace cannot but remember
times when my awkward attempts to take
the manners that pleased you were the sport
 the courtpopinjays the maries and the
frenchwomen
 my lord i grieve if i have offended you
through idle gaiety said the queen and
can but say it was most unwittingly done
you are fully revenged for through gaiety
she said with a sigh will i never offend
any one more
our time is wasting madam said
lord ruthven j i must pray your decision
on this weighty matter which i have
submitted to you
 what my lord said the queen upon
the instant and without a moment's time to
deliberate can the council as they term
themselves expect this me 
madam replied ruthven the count
abbot 
cil hold the opinion that since the fatal
term which passed betwixt the night 
king henry's murder and the day 
your grace should have held you
prepared for the measure now proposed as
the easiest escape from your numerous dangers
and difficulties
 great god exclaimed the queen 
and is it as a boon that you propose tome
what every christian king ought to regard
as a loss honour equal to the loss 
life you take from me my crown my
power my subjects my wealth my state
what in the name every saint can you
offer or do you offer in requital my compliance

 we give you pardon answered rutheven
sternly we give you space and means
to spend your remaining life in penitence
and seclusion we give you time to make
your peace with heaven and to receive the
pure gospel which you have ever rejected
and persecuted
k 
sic the abbot
the queen turned pale at the menace
which this speech as well as the rough and
inflexible tones the speaker seemed distinctly
to infer and if i do not comply
with your request so fiercely urged my
lord what then follows 
she said this in a voice in which female
and natural fear was contending with the
feelings insulted dignity there was a
pause as if no one cared to return to the
question a distinct answer at length rutheven
spoke there is little need to tell
to your grace who are well read both in
the laws and in the chronicles the realm
that murder and adultery are crimes for
which ere now queens themselves have suffered
death
and where ray lord or how found you
an accusation so horrible against her who
stands before you said queen mary
 the foul and odious calumnies which
have poisoned the general mind scotland
and placed me a helpless prisoner in
your hands are surely no proof guilt
the abbot 
we need look for no farther proof than
the shameless marriage betwixt the widow
 the murdered and the leader the band
 murderers they that joined hands in
the fated month may had already united
hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded
that marriage but a few brief weeks
my lord my lord said the queen
eagerly remember well there were more
consents than mine went to that fatal union
that most unhappy act a most unhappy
life the evil steps adopted by sovereigns
are often the suggestion bad counsellors
but these counsellors are worse than fiends
who tempt and betrays they themselves are
the first to call their unfortunate princes to
answer for the consequences their own
advice heard ye never a bond by the
nobles my lords recommending that illfated
union to the illfated mary methinks
were it carefully examined we should see
that the names morton and lindesay
and ruthven may be found in that bond
i 
s the abbot
which pressed me to marry that unhappy
man ah stout and loyal lord berries
who never knew guile or dishonour you
bent your noble knee to me in vain to
warn me my danger and wert yet the first
to draw thy good sword in my cause when i
suffered for neglecting thy counsel faithful
knight and true noble what a difference
betwixt thee and those counsellors evil
who now threaten my life for having fallen
into the snares they spread for me 
 madam said ruthven we know that
you are an orator and perhaps for that reason
the council has sent hither men whose
converse hath been more with the wars than
with the language the schools or the cabals
 state we but desire to know if on
assurance life and honour ye will demit
the rule this kingdom scotland 
 and what warrant have i said the
queen that ye will keep treaty with me
if i should barter my kingly estate for seclusion
and leave to weep in secret 
the abbor 
 our honour and our word madam
answered ruthven
they are too slight and unsold pledges
my lord said the queen add at
least a handful thistledown to give them
weight in the balance
away ruthven said lindesay she
was ever deaf to counsel save slaves and
sycophants let her remain by her refusal
and abide by it
stay my lord said sir robert melville
 or rather permit me to have but a
few minutes private audience with her
grace if my presence with you could
avail aught it must be as a mediator do
not i conjure you leave the castle or
break off the conference until i bring you
word how her grace shall finally stand disposed

 we will remain in the hall said lindsay
 for half an hour's space but in despising
our words and our pledge honour
she has touched the honour my name 
s the abbot
let her look herself to the course she has to
pursue if the half hour should pass away
without her determining to comply with
the demands the nation her career will
be brief enough
with little ceremony the two nobles left
the apartment traversed the vestibule and
descended the windingstairs the clash 
lindesay's huge sword being heard as it rang
against each step in his descent george
douglas followed them after exchanging
with melville a gesture surprise and sympathy

as soon as they were gone the queen
again giving way to grief fear and agitation
threw herself into the seat wrung her
hands and seemed to abandon herself to
despair her female attendants weeping
themselves endeavoured yet to pray hero
be composed and sir robert melville
kneeling at her feet made the same entreaty
after giving way to a passionate
burst sorrow she at length said to melthe
abbot 
ville kneel not to me melville mock
me not with the homage the person when
the heart is far away why stay you behind
with the deposed the condemned her who
has but few hours perchance to live you
have been favoured as well as the rest j why
do you continue the empty show gratitude
and thankfulness any longer than they 
 madam said sir robert melville so
help me heaven at my need my heart is as
true to you as when you were in your highest
place
 true to me true to me repeated the
queen with some scorn j tush melville
what signifies the truth which walks hand
in hand with my enemies falsehood thy
hand and thy sword have never been so well
acquainted that i can trust thee in aught
where manhood is required o seyton for
thy bold father who is both wise true and
valiant 
roland graeme could withstand no longer
his earnest desire to offer his services to a
 the abbot
princess so distressed and so 
one sword he said madam can do
any thing to back the wisdom this grave
counsellor or to defend your rightful cause
here is my weapon and here is my hand
ready to draw and use it and raising his
sword with the one hand he laid the other
upon the hilt
as he thus held up the weapon catherine
seyton exclaimed methinks i see a
token from my father madam and immediately
crossing the apartment she took
roland graeme by the skirt the cloak
and asked him earnestly whence he had
that sword
the page answered with surprise methinks
this is no presence in which to jest 
surely damsel you yourself best know
whence and how i obtained the weapon
 is this a time for folly said catherine
seyton unsheathe the sword instantly 
if the queen commands me said the
youth looking towards his royal mistress
the abbot s
 for shame maiden said the queen j
 wouldst thou instigate the poor boy to
enter into useless strife with the two most
approved soldiers in scotland 
in your grace's cause replied the
page i will venture my life upon them 
and as he spoke he drew his weapon partly
from the sheath and a piece parchment
rolled around the blade fell out and dropped
on the floor catherine seyton caught
it up with eager haste
 it is my father's hand writing she
said and doubtless conveys his best duteous
advice to your majesty i knew that
it was prepared to be sent in this weapon
but i expected another messenger
by my faith fair one thought roland
and if you knew not that i had such a secret
missive about me i was yet more ignorant

the queen cast her eye upon the scroll
and remained a few minutes wrapped in
deep thought sir robert melville she
 the abbot
at length said this scroll advises me to
submit myself to necessity and to subscribe
the deeds these hard men have brought with
them as one who gives way to the natural
fear inspired by the threats rebels and
murtherers you sir robert are a wiseman
and seyton is both sagacious and
brave neither i think would mislead
me in this matter
madam said melville if i have not
the strength body the lords berries or
seyton i will yield to neither in zeal for
your majesty's service i cannot fight for
you like these lords but neither them
are more willing to die for your service
i believe it my old and faithful counsellor
said the queen and believe me
melville i did thee but a moment's injustice
read what my lord seyton hath
written to us and give us thy best counsel
he glanced over the parchment and instantly
replied o my dear and royal
mistress only treason itself could give you
other advice than lord seyton has here
the abbot 
expressed he berries huntley the english
ambassador throgmorton and others
your friends are all alike opinion that
whatever deeds or instruments you execute
within these walls must lose all force and
effect as extorted from your grace by dress
by sufferance present evil and fear
 men and harm to ensue on your refusal
yield therefore to the tide and be assured
that in subscribing what parchments they
presenttoyou you bind yourself to nothing
since your act signature wants that which
alone can make it valid the free will 
the granter
 ay so says my lord seyton replied
mary yet methinks for the daughter 
so long a line sovereigns to resign her
birth right because rebels press upon her
with threats argues little royalty and
will read ill for the fame mary in future
chronicles tush sir robert melville
the traitors may use black threats and bold
words but they will not dare to put their
hands forth on our person
 the abbot
alas madam they have already dared
so far and incurred such peril by the lengths
which they have gone that they are but one
step from the worst and uttermost
 surely said the queen her fears again
predominating scottish nobles would not
lend themselves to assassinate a helpless
woman 
 bethink you madam he replied
 what horrid spectacles have been seen
in our day and what act is so dark that
some scottish hand has not been found to
dare it lord lindesay besides his natural
sullenness and hardness temper is the
near kinsman henry darnley and rutheven
has his own deep and dangerous plans
the council besides speak proofs by
writ and word a casket with letters 
i know not what
ah good melville answered the
queen were i as sure the evenhanded
integrity my judges as my own
innocence and yet
 oh pause madam said melville j
the abbot 
 even innocence must sometimes for a
season stoop to injurious blame besides
you are here
he looked round and paused
 speak out melville said the queen
 never one approached my person who
wished to work me evil and even this poor
page whom i have today seen for the first
time in my life i can trust safely with your
communication
 nay madam answered melville in
such emergence and he being the bearer
 lord seyton's message i will venture to
say before him and these fair ladies whose
truth and fidelity i dispute not i say i will
venture to say that there are other modes
besides that open trial by which deposed
sovereigns often die and that as machiavel
saith there is but one step betwixt a
king's prison and his grave
oh were it but swift and easy for the
body said the unfortunate princess were
it but safe and happy change for the soul
the woman lives not that would take the
 the abbot
step so soon as i but alas melville
when we think death a thousand sins
which we have trode as worms beneath our
feet rise up against us as flaming serpents
most injuriously do they accuse me being
aiding darnley death yet blessed
lady i afforded too open occasion for the
suspicion i espoused bothwell
think not that now madam said
melville think rather the immediate
mode saving yourself and son comply
with their present unreasonable demands
and trust that better times will shortly arrives

 madam said roland graeme if it
pleases you that i should do so i will presently
swim through the lake if they refuse
me other conveyance to the shore i will
go to the courts successively england
france and spain and will shew you have
subscribed these vile instruments from no
stronger impulse than the fear death
and i will do battle against them that say
otherwise
the abbot 
the queen turned her round and with
one those sweet smiles which during the
era life's romance overpay every risk
held her hand towards roland but without
speaking a word he kneeled reverently
and kissed it and melville again resumed
his plea
 madam he said time presses and you
must not let these boats which i see they are
even now preparing put forth on the lake
here are enough witnesses your ladies
this bold youth myself when it can serve
your cause effectually for i would not hastily
stand committed in this matter but
even without me here is evidence enough
to shew that you have yielded to the demands
 the council through force and
fear but from no sincere and unconstrained
assent their boats are already manned
for their return oh permit your old servant
to recal them
 melville said the queen thou art
an ancient courtier when didst thou ever
know a sovereign prince recal to his presto
the abbot
sence subjects who had parted from him on
such terms as those on which these envoys
 the council left us and who yet were
recalled without submission or apology 
let it cost me both life and crown i will
not again command them to my presence
alas madam that empty form should
make a barrier if i rightly understand you
are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous
counsel but your scruple is saved
i hear them return to ask your final resolution
 o take the advice the noble
seyton and you may once more command
those who now usurp a triumph over you
but hush i hear them in the vestibule
as he concluded speaking george douglas
opened the door the apartment and
marshalled in the two noble envoys
 we come madam said the lord
ruthven to request your answer to the
proposal the council
 your final answer said lord lindesay
for with a refusal you must couple the
certainty that you have precipitated your
the abbot 
fate and renounced the last opportunity 
making peace with god and ensuring your
longer abode in the world
my lords said mary with inexpressible
grace and dignity the evils we cannot
resist we must submit to i will subscribe
these parchments with such liberty choice
as my condition permits me were i on
yonder shore with a fleet jennet and ten
good and loyal knights around me i would
subscribe my sentence eternal condemnation
as soon as the resignation my
throne but here in the castle cochlea
with deep water around me and you
my lords beside me i have no freedom 
choice give me the pen melville and bear
witness to what i do and why i do it
 it is our hope your grace will not suppose
yourself compelled by any apprehensions
from us said the lord ruthven to
execute what must be your own voluntary
deed
the queen had already stooped towards
the table and placed the parchment before
vol l
 the abbot
her with the pen between her fingers ready
for the important act signature but
when lord ruthven had done speaking she
looked up stopped short and threw down
the pen if said she i am expected
to declare i give away my crown freewill
or otherwise than because i am compelled
to renounce it by the threat worse
evils to myself and my subjects i will not
put my name to such an untruth not to
gain full possession england france and
scotland all once my own in possession or
by right
beware madam said lindesay and
snatching hold the queen's arm with his
own gauntlets hand he pressed it in the
rudeness his passion more closely perhaps
than he was himself aware beware
how you contend with those who are
the stronger and have the mastery your
fate
he held his grasp on her arm bending
his eyes on her with a stern and intimidating
look till both ruthven and melthe
abbot 
ville cried shame and douglas who had
hitherto remained in a state apparent
apathy had made a stride from the door as
if to interfere the rude baron then quitted
his hold disguising the confusion which
he really felt at having indulged his passion
to such extent under a sullen and contemptuous
smile
the queen immediately began with an
expression pain to bare the arm which
he had grasped by drawing up the sleeve 
her gown and it appeared that his grasp
had left the purple marks his iron fingers
upon her flesh my lord she said asa
knight and gentleman you might have
spared my frail arm so severe a proof that
you have the greater strength on your side
and are resolved to use it but i thank
you for itit is the most decisive token 
the terms on which this day's business is to
rest i draw you to witness both lords and
ladies she said shewing the marks the
grasp on her arm that i subscribe these
instruments in obedience to the sign manual
 the abbot
 my lord lindesay which you may
see imprinted on mine arm
lindesay would have spoken but was restrained
by his colleague ruthven who said
to him peace my lord let the lady
mary scotland ascribe her signature to
what she will it is our business to procure
it and to carry it to the council should
there be debate hereafter on the manner in
which it was exhibited there will be time
enough for it
lindesay was silent accordingly only
muttering within his beard i meant not
to hurt her but i think women's flesh be as
tender as newfallen snow
the queen meanwhile subscribed the
rolls parchment with a hasty indifference
as if they had been matters slight consequence
or mere formality when she had
performed this painful task she arose and
having curtsied to the lords was about to
withdraw to her chamber ruthven and
sir robert melville made the first a formal
reverence the second an obeisance in
the abbot 
which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy
was obviously checked by the fear 
appearing in the eyes his colleagues too
partial to his former mistress but lindsay
stood motionless even when they were
preparing to withdraw at length as if
moved by a sudden impulse he walked
round the table which had hitherto been
betwixt them and the queen kneeled on
one knee took her hand kissed it let it
fall and arose lady he said thou
art a noble creature even though thou
hast abused god's choicest gifts i pay that
devotion to thy manliness spirit which
i would not have paid to the power thou
hast long unreservedly wielded i kneel to
mary stuart not tb the queen
 the queen and mary stuart pity thee
alike lindesay said mary alike they
pity and they forgive thee an honoured soldier
hadst thou been by aking's side leagued
with rebels what art thou but a good blade
in the hands a ruffian farewell my
lord ruthven the smoother but the deeper
 the abbot
traitor farewell melville mayst thou
find masters that can understand state policy
better and have the means to reward
it more richly than mary stuart farewell
george douglas make your respected
grand'dame comprehend that we would be
alone for the remainder the day god
wot we have need to collect our thoughts
all bowed and withdrew but scarce had
they entered the vestibule ere ruthven
and lindesay were at variance chide
not with me ruthven lindesay was heard
to say in answer to something more indistinctly
urged by his colleague chide not
with me for i will not brook it you put
the hangman's office on me in this matter
and even the very hangman hath leave to
ask some pardon those on whom he does
his office i would i had as deep cause to
be this lady's friend as i have to be her enemy
 thou shouldst see if i spared limb and
life in her quarrel
thou art a sweet minion said rutheven
 to fight a lady's quarrel and all for
the abbot 
a brent brow and a tear in the eye such
toys have been out thy thoughts this
many a year
 do me right ruthven said lindesay
you are like a polished corslet steel it
shines more gaudily but it is not a whit
softer nay it is five times harder than a
glasgow breastplate hammered iron
enough we know each other
they descended the stairs were heard
to summon their boats and the queen signed
to roland graeme to retire to the vestibule
and leave her with her female attendants

 the abbot
chapter viii
give me a morsel on the greensward rather
coarse as you will the cooking let the fresh spring
bubble beside my napkin sand the free birds
twittering and chirping hop from bough to bough
to claim the crumbs i leave for perquisites 
your prisonfeasts i like not 
the woodsman a drama
a recess in the vestibule was enlightened
by a small window at which roland
graeme stationed himself to mark the departure
 the lords he could see their
followers mustering on horseback under
their respective banners the western sun
glancing on their corslet and steel caps as
they moved to and fro mounted or dismounted
at intervals on the narrow space
betwixt the castle and the water the lords
bwuthven and lindesay were already moving
the abbot 
slowly to their boats accompanied by the
lady lochleven her grandson and their
principal attendants they took a ceremonious
leave each other as roland could
discern by their gestures and the boats put
c from the landingplace the boatmen
stretched to their oars and they speedily
diminished upon the eye the idle gazer
who had no better employ ment than to watch
their motions such seemed also the occupation
 the lady lochleven and george
douglas who returning from the landingplace
looked frequently back to the boats
and at length stopped as if to observe their
progress under the window at which roland
graeme was stationed as they gazed on
the lake he could hear the lady distinctly
say and she has bent her mind to save
her life at the expence her kingdom r
her life madam replied her son i
know not who would dare to attempt it
in the castle my father had i dreamt
that it was with such purpose that lindesay
l 
 the abbot
insisted on bringing his followers hither
neither he nor they should have passed the
iron gate lochleven castle
 i speak not private slaughter my
son but open trial condemnation and
execution for with such she has been threatened
and to such threats she has given way
had she not had more the false russian
blood than the royal race scotland in
her veins she had bidden them defiance to
their teeth but it is all the same complexion
and meanness is the natural companion
 profligacy i am discharged forsooth
from intruding on her gracious presence
this evening go thou my son and
render the usual service the meal to this
unqueened queen
so please you lady mother said douglas
 i care not greatly to approach her
presence
 thou art right my son and therefore
i trust thy prudence even because i have
noted thy caution she is like an isle on the
the abbot 
ocean surrounded with shelves and quicksands
its verdure fair and inviting to the eye
but the wreck many a goodly vessel which
hath approached it too rashly but for thee
my son i fear nought and we may not
with our honour suffer her to eat without
the attendance one us she may die
by the judgment heaven or the fiend
may have power over her in her despair 
and then we would be touched in honour
to shew that in our house and at our table
she had had all fair play and fitting usage
here roland was interrupted by a smart
tap on the shoulders reminding him sharply
 adam woodcock's adventure the
preceding evening he turned round almost
expecting to see the page saint
michael's hostelry he saw indeed catherine
seyton but she was in female attire
differing indeed a great deal in shape and
materials from that which she had worn
when they first met and becoming her
birth as the daughter a great baron and
 the abbot
her rank as the attendant on a princess
 so fair page said she eaves dropping
is one your page like qualities i presume
 fair sister answered roland in the
same tone if some friends mine be as
well acquainted with the rest our mystery
as they are with the arts swearing
swaggering and switching they need ask
no page in christendom for further insight
into his vocation
 unless that pretty speech infer that
you have yourself had the discipline the
switch since we last met the probability
whereof i nothing doubt i profess fair
page i am at a loss to conjecture your
meaning but there is no time to debate
it now they come with the evening meal
be pleased sir page to do your duty
four servants entered bearing dishes
preceded by the same stern old steward
whom roland had already seen and followed
by george douglas already mentioned
as the grandson the lady lochleven
and who acting as seneschal replete
abbot 
seated upon this occasion his father the
lord the castle he entered with his
arms folded on his bosom and his looks
bent on the ground with the assistance
 roland grasme a table was suitably covered
in the next or middle apartment on
which the domestics placed their burthens
with great reverence the steward and douglas
bending low when they had seen the
table properly adorned as if their royal prisoner
had sate at the board in question the
door opened and douglas raising his eyes
hastily cast them again on the earth when
he perceived it was only the lady mary
fleming who entered
her grace she said will not eat
tonight
 let us hope she may be otherwise persuaded
said douglas meanwhile madam
please to see our duty performed
a servant presented bread and salt on a
silver plate and the old steward carved for
douglas a small morsel in succession from
each the dishes presented which he
 the abbot
tasted as was then the custom at the tables
 princes to which death was often
suspected to find its way in the disguise 
food
the queen will not then come forth
tonight said douglas
 she has so determined replied the
lady
 our further attendance then is unnecessary
 we leave you to your supper fair
ladies and wish you good even
he retired slowly as he came and with
the same air deep dejection and was
followed by the attendants belonging to
the castle the two ladies sate down to
their meal and poland greene with ready
alacrity prepared to wait upon them catherine
seyton whispered her companion
who replied with the question spoken in a
low tone but looking at the page is he
 gentle blood and well nurtured 
the answer which she received seemed
satisfactory for she said to roland sit
the abbot 
down young gentleman and eat with your
sisters in captivity
 permit me rather to perform my duty
in attending them said roland anxious
to shew he was possessed the high tone
 deference prescribed by the rules chivalry
towards the fair sex and especially to
dames and maidens quality
you will find sir page said catherine
you will have little time allowed you for
your meal waste it not in ceremony or you
may rue your politeness ere tomorrow
morning
 your speech is too free maiden said
the elder lady the modesty the youth
may teach you more fitting fashions towards
one whom today you have seen for the first
time
catherine sey ton cast down her eyes but
not till she had given a single glance inexpressible
archness towards roland whom
her more grave companion now addressed
in a tone protection
 the abbot
 regard her not young gentleman 
she knows little the world save the forms
 a country nunnerystake thy place at the
board and refresh thyself after thy
journey
roland graeme obeyed willingly as it
was the first food he had that day tasted j
for lindesay and his followers seemed regardless
 human wants yet notwithstanding
the sharpness his appetite a natural
gallantry disposition the desire 
shewing himself a wellnurtured gentleman
in all courtesies towards the fair sex and
for aught i know the pleasure assisting
catherine seyton kept his attention awake
during the meal to all those nameless acts
 duty and service which gallants that
age were accustomed to render he carved
with neatness and decorum and selected
duly whatever was most delicate to place
before the ladies ere they could form a
wish he sprung from the table ready to
comply with it poured wine tempered
the abbot 
it with water removed and exchanged
trenchers and performed the whole honours
 the table with an air at once 
cheerful diligence profound respect and
graceful promptitude
when he observed that they had finished
eating he hastened to offer to the elder
lady the silver ewer basin and napkin
with the ceremony and gravity which
he would have used towards mary herself
he next with the same decorum having
supplied the basin with fair water presented
it to catherine seyton apparently
she was determined to disturb his selfpossession
if possible for while in the act 
bathing her hands she contrived as it were
by accident to flirt some drops water
upon the face the assiduous assistant
but if such was her mischievous purpose
she was completely disappointed for roland
graeme internally piquing himself on
his selfcommand neither laughed nor was
discomposed and all that the maiden gained
by her frolic was a severe rebuke from
 the abbot
her companion taxing her with maladdress
and indecorum catherine replied not but
sat pouting something in the humour a
spoilt child who watches the opportunity
 wreaking upon some one or other its resentment
for a deserved reprimand j
the lady mary fleming in the meanwhile
was naturally well pleased with the
exact and reverent observance the page a
and said to catherine after a favourable
glance at roland graeme you might
well say catherine our companion in inactivity
was wellborn and gently nurtured i
i would not make him vain by my praise
but his services enable us to dispense with
those which george douglas condescends
not to afford us save when the queen is
herself in presence
humph i think hardly answered catherine
 george douglas is one the
most handsome gallants in scotland and
tis pleasure to see him even still when the
gloom lochleven castle has shed the
same melancholy over him that it has done
the abbot 
over every thing else when he was at
holyrood who would have said the young
sprightly george douglas would have been
contented to play the locksman here in
lochleven with no gayer amusement than
that turning the key on two or three
helpless women a strange office for a
knight the bleeding heart why does
he not leave it to his father or his brothers

perhaps like us he has no choice answered
the lady fleming but catherine
thou hast used thy brief space at court
well to remember what george douglas
was then
i used mine eyes which i suppose was
what i was designed to do and they were
worth using there when i was at the nunnery
they were very useless appurtenances
and now i am at lochleven they are good
for nothing save to look over that eternal
work embroidery
 you say thus when you have been but
 the abbot
a few brief hours amongst us was this the
maiden who would live and die in a dungeon
might she but have permission to wait
on her gracious queen 
nay if you chide in earnest my jest
is ended said catherine seyton i would
not yield in attachment to my poor godmother
to the gravest dame that ever had
wise saws upon her tongue and a doublestarched
ruff around her throat you know
i would not dame mary fleming and it
is putting shame on me to say otherwise 
she will challenge the other court lady
thought roland greene j she will to a certainty
fling down her glove and if dame
mary fleming hath but the soul to lift it
we may have a combat in the lists but the
answer lady mary fleming was such as
turns away wrath
 thou art a good child she said my
catherine and a faithful but heaven pity
him who shall have one day a creature so
beautiful to delight him and a thing so
the abbot l
mischievous to torment him thou art fit
to drive twenty husbands stark mad
 nay said catherine resuming the
full career her careless good humour
he must be halfwitted beforehand that
gives me such an opportunity but i am
glad you are not angry with me in sincerity
casting herself as she spoke into the
arms her friend and continuing with a
tone apologetic fondness while she kissed
her on either side the face you
know my dear fleming that i have to contend
with both my father's lofty pride and
with my mother's high spirit god bless
them they have left me these good qualities
having small portion to give beside as
times go and so i am wilful and saucy 
but let me remain but a week in this castle
and o my dear fleming my spirit will
be as chastised and as humble as thine
own
dame mary fleming's sense dignity
and love form could not resist this
 the abbot
affectionate appeal she kissed catherine
seyton in her turn affectionately while answering
the last part her speech she said
 now our lady forbid dear catherine
that you should lose aught that is beseeming
 what becomes so well your light heart
and lively humour keep but your sharp
wit on this side madness and it cannot
but be a blessing to us but let me go mad
wench i hear her grace touch her silver
call and extricating herself from catherine's
grasp she went towards the door 
queen mary from which was heard the
low tone a silver whistle which now only
used by the boatswains in the navy was
then for want bells the ordinary mode
by which ladies even the very highest
rank summoned their domestics when
she had made two or three steps towards
the door the queen's apartment however
she turned back and advancing to the
young couple whom she left together she
said in a very serious though a low tone
 i trust it is impossible that we can any 
the abbot 
us or in any circumstances forget that few
as we are we form the household the
queen scotland and that in her calamity
all boyish mirth and childish jesting
can only serve to give a great triumph to
her enemies who have already found their
account in objecting to her the lightness
 every idle folly that the young and the
gay practised in her court so saying she
left the apartment
catherine seyton seemed much struck
with this remonstrance she suffered herself
to drop into the seat which she had
quitted when she went to embrace dame
mary fleming and for some time rested
her brow upon her hands while roland
graeme looked at her earnestly with a mixture
 emotions which perhaps he himself
could neither have analyzed nor explained
as she raised her face slowly from the posture
to which a momentary feeling selfrebuke
had depressed it her eyes encountered
those roland and became gradually
animated with their usual spirit 
the abbot
pious drollery which not unnaturally exci 
ted a similar expression in those the 
equally volatile page they sat for the
space two minutes each looking at the 
other with great seriousness on their features
and much mirth in their eyes until 
at length catherine was the first to break
silence
 may i pray you fair sir she began
very demurely to tell me what you see
in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious
and knowing as those with which
it is your worship's pleasure to honour me i
it would seem as there were some wonderful
confidence and intimacy betwixt us fair
sir if one is to judge from your extremely
cunning looks and so help me our lady
as i never saw you but twice in my life before

and where were these happy occasions
said roland if i may be bold
enough to ask the question 
 at the nunnery saint catherine's
said the damsel in the first instance j and
the abbot 
in the second during five minutes a certain
raid or foray which it was your pleasure
to make into the lodging my lord
and father lord seyton from which to my
surprise as probably to your own you returned
with a token friendship and favour
instead broken bones which were
the more probable reward your intrusion
considering the prompt ire the house 
seyton i am deeply mortified she added
ironically that your recollection should
require refreshment on a subject so important
 and that my memory should be stronger
than yours on such an occasion is truly
humiliating
 your own memory is not so exactly
correct fair mistress answered the page
 seeing you have forgotten meeting the
third in the hostelry saint michael's
when it pleased you to lay your switch
across the face my comrade in order
i warrant to shew that in the house 
seyton neither the prompt ire its descendants
nor the use the doublet and
vol ir m
 the abbot
hose are subject to salique law or confined
to the use the males
fair sir answered catherine looking
at him with great steadiness and some surprise
 unless your fair wits have forsaken
you i am at a loss what to conjecture 
your meaning
by my troth fair mistress answered
roland and were i as wise a warlock as
michael scott i could scarce riddle the
dream you read me did i not see you last
night in the hostelry saint michael's 
did you not bring me this sword with command
not to draw it save at the command
 my native and rightful sovereign and
have i not done as you required me oris
the sword a piece lath mynvord a
bullrush my memory a dream and my
eyes good for nought spirals which corlies
might pick out my head 
and if your eyes serveyou not more
truly on other occasions than in your vision
 saint michael said catherine i know
not the pain apart that the cries would
the abbot l
do you any great injury in the deprivation
but hark the bell hush for god's sake
we are interrupted
the damsel was right for no sooner
had the dull toll the castle bell begun
to resound through the vaulted apartment
than the door the vestibule flew open
and the steward with his severe countenance
his gold chain and his white rod
entered the apartment followed by the
same train domestics who had placed
the dinner on the table and who now
with the same ceremonious formality began
to remove it
the steward remained motionless as
some old picture while the domestics did
their office and when it was accomplished
every thing removed from the table
and the board itself taken from its tresses
and disposed against the wall he said
aloud without addressing any one in particular
and somewhat in the tone a herald
reading a proclamation my noble
lady dame margaret erskine by marcs
the abbot
rage douglas lets the lady mary scotland
and her attendants to wit that a servant
 the true evangelic her reverend
chaplain will tonight as usual expound
lecture and catechize according to the
forms the congregation gospellers
 hark you my friend mr dryfesdale
said catherine i understand this announcement
is a nightly form yours
now i pray you to remark that the lady
fleming and i for i trust your insolent
invitation concerns us only have chosen
saint peter's pathway to heaven so i see
no one whom your godly exhortation catechize
or lecture can benefit excepting
this poor page who being in satan's hand
as well as yourself had better worship with
you than remain to cumber our betteradvised
devotions
the page was well nigh giving a round
denial to the assertion with this speech
implied when remembering what had passed
betwixt him and the regent and seeing
catherine's finger raised in a monitory
the abbot 
fashion he felt himself as on former occasions
at the castle avenel obliged to
submit to the task dissimulation and
followed clydesdale down to the castlechapel
where he assisted in the devotions
 the evening
the chaplain was named elias henderson
he was a man in the prime 
life and possessed good natural parts
carefully improved by the best education
which these times afforded to these qualities
were added a faculty close and
terse reasoning and at intervals a flow 
happy illustration and natural eloquence
the religious faith roland graeme as
we have already had opportunity to observe
rested on no secure basis but was
entertained rather in obedience to his
grandmother's behests and his secret desire
to contradict the chaplain avenel
castle than from any fixed or steady reliance
which he placed on the romish creed
his ideas had been late considerably enlarged
by the scenes he had passed through j
 the abbot
and feeling that there was shame in not understanding
something those political
disputes betwixt the professors the ancient
and the reformed faith he listened
with more attention than it had hitherto
been in his nature to yield on such occasions
to an animated discussion some
 the principal points difference betwixt
the churches so passed away the
first day in the castle lochleven and
those which followed it were for sometime
 a very monotonous and uniform
tenor
the abbot ll
chapter 
tis a weary life this
vaults overhead and grates and bars around me
and my sad hours spent with as sad companions
whose thoughts are brooding o er their own mischances
far far too deeply to take part in mine
the woodsman
the course life to which mary and
her little retinue were doomed was in the
last degree secluded and lonely varied only
as the weather permitted or rendered impossible
the queen's usual walk in the garden
or on the battlements the greater part 
the morning she wrought with her ladies at
those pieces needle work many which
still remain proofs her indefatigable application
at such hours the page was permitted
the freedom the castle and islet 
nay he was sometimes invited to attend
george douglas when he went a sporting
the abbot
ing upon the lake or on its margin j opportunities
 diversion which were only
clouded by the remarkable melancholy
which always seemed to brood on that gentleman's
brow and to mark his whole demeanour
 a sadness so profound that roland
never observed him to smile or to
speak any word unconnected with the immediate
object their exercise
the most pleasant part roland's day
was the occasional space which he was permitted
to pass in personal attendance on the
queen and her ladies together with the regular
dinnertime which he always spent
with dame mary fleming and catherine
seyton on these occasions he had frequent
occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive
imagination the latter damsel
who was unwearied in her contrivances to
amuse her mistress and to banish for a time
at least the melancholy which preyed on
her bosom she danced she sung she recited
tales ancient and modern times with
that heartfelt exertion talent which
the abbot 
the pleasure lies not in the vanity displaying
it to others but in the enthusiastic
consciousness that we possess it ourselves
and yet these high accomplishments were
mixed with an airof rusticity and hairbrained
vivacity which seemed rather to belong
to some village maid the coquette the
ring around the maypole than to the highbred
descendant an ancient baron a
touch audacity altogether shorts effrontery
and far less approaching to vulgarity
gave as it were a wildness to all that she did
and mary while defending her from some
occasional censure her grave companion
compared her to a trained singingbird escaped
from a cage which practises in all the
luxuriance freedom and in full possession
 the greenwood bough the airs which
it had learned during its earlier captivity
the moments which the page was permitted
to pass in the presence this fascinating
creature danced so rapidly away
that brief as they were they compensated
the weary dulness all the rest the day
m 
 the abt
the space indulgence however was
always brief nor were any private interviews
betwixt him and catherine permitted
or even possible whether it were some
special precaution respecting the queen's
household or whether it were her general
ideas propriety dame fleming seemed
particularly attentive to prevent the young
people from holding any separate correspondence
together and bestowed for catherine's
sole benefit in this matter the full
stock prudence and experience which she
had acquired when mother the queen's
maidens honour and by which she had
acquired their hearty hatred casual meetings
however could not be prevented unless
catherine had been more desirous 
shunning or roland graeme less anxious
in watching for them a smile a gibe
a sarcasm disarmed its severity by the
arch look with which it was accompanied
was all that time permitted to pass between
them on such occasions but such
passing interview neither afforded time nor
the abbot 
opportunity to renew the discussion the
circumstances attending their earlier acquaintance
nor to permit roland to investigate
more accurately the mysterious apparition
 the page in the purple velvet cloak
at the hostelry saint michael's
the winter's months slipped heavily away
and spring was already advanced when
roland graeme observed a gradual change
in the manners his fellow prisoners
having no business his own to attend
to and being like those his age education
and degree sufficiently curious concerning
what passed around he became by
degrees to suspect and finally to be convinced
that there was something in agitation
among his companions in captivity
to which they did not desire that he should
be privy nay he became almost certain
that by some means unintelligible to him
queen mary held correspondence beyond
the walls and waters which surrounded her
prisonhouse and that she nourished some
secret hope deliverance or escape in
the conversations betwixt her and her 
the abbot
tenants at which he was necessarily present
the queen could not always avoid
shewing that she was acquainted with the
events which were passing abroad in the
world and which he only heard through
her report he observed that she wrote
more and worked less than had been her
former custom and that as if desirous to lull
suspicion asleep she changed her manner
towards the lady lochleven into one more
gracious and which seemed to express a
resigned submission to her lot they
think i am blind he said to himself and
that i am unfit to be trusted because i am
so young or it may be because i was sent
hither by the regent well be it so 
they may be glad to confide in me in the
long run and catherine seyton for as saucy
as she is may find me as safe a confidant as
that sullen douglas whom she is always running
after it may be they are angry with
me for listening to master elias henderson 
but it was their own fault for sending me
there and if the man speaks truth and good
sense and preaches only the word god
the abbot 
he is as like to be right as either pope or
councils
it is probable that in this last conjecture
roland graeme had hit upon the real cause
why the ladies had not entrusted him with
their counsel he had late had several
conferences with henderson on the subject
 religion and had given him to understand
that he stood in need his instructions
although he had not thought there
was either prudence or necessity for confessing
that hitherto he had held the tenets 
the church rome
elias henderson a keen propagator 
the reformed faith had sought the seclusion
 lochleven castle with the express purpose
and expectation making converts
from rome amongst the domestics the
dethroned queen and confirming the faith 
those who already held the protestant doctrines
perhaps his hopes soared a little higher
and he might nourish some expectation
 a proselyte more distinguished in the person
 the deposed queen but the 
the abbot
tenacity with which she and her female au
tenants refused to see or listen to him
rendered such hope if he nourished it altogether
abortive
the opportunity therefore enlarging
the religious information roland
graeme and bringing him to a more due
sense his duties to heaven was hailed
by the good man as a door opened by
providence for the salvation a sinner
he dreamed not indeed that he was converting
a papist but such was the ignorance
which england displayed upon some
material points the reformed doctrine
that master henderson while praising his
docility to the lady lochleven and her
grandson seldom failed to add that his venerable
brother henry warden must be
now decayed in strength and in mind since
he found a catechumen his flock so ill
grounded in the principles his belief
for this indeed roland graeme thought it
was unnecessary to assign the true reason
which was his having made it a point 
the abbot 
honour to forget all that henry warden
taught him as soon as he was no longer
compelled to repeat it over as a lesson acquired
by rote the lessons his new instructor
if not more impressively delivered
were received by a more willing ear
and a more awakened understanding and
the solitude lochleven castle was favourable
to graver thoughts than the page
had hitherto entertained he wavered yet
indeed as one who was almost persuaded 
but his attention to the chaplain's instructions
procured him favour even with the
stern old dame herself and he was once or
twice but under great precaution permitted
to go to the neighbouring village 
kinross situated on the mainland to execute
some ordinary commission his unfortunate
mistress
for some time roland greene might be
considered as standing neuter betwixt the
two parties who inhabited the watergirdled
tower lochleven but as he rose in the
opinion the lady the castle and her
 the abbot
chaplain he perceived with great grief that
he lost ground in that mary and her female
allies
he came gradually to be sensible that
he was regarded as a spy upon their discourse
and that instead the ease with
which they had formerly conversed in his
presence without suppressing any the
natural feelings anger or sorrow or
mirth which the chance topic the moment
happened to call forth their talk was
now studiously restricted to the most indifferent
subjects and a studied reserve
observed even in their mode treating
these this obvious want confidence was
accompanied with a correspondent change
in their personal demeanour towards the
unfortunate page the queen who had
at first treated him with marked courtesy
now scarce spoke to him save to convey
some necessary command for her service
the lady fleming restricted her notice to
the most dry and distant expressions civility
and catherine seyton became bitthe
abbot 
ter in her pleasantries and shy cross and
petted in any intercourse they had together
what was yet more provoking he
saw or thought he saw marks intelligence
betwixt george douglas and the
beautiful catherine seyton and sharpened
by jealousy he wrought himself almost
into a certainty that the looks which they
exchanged conveyed matters deep and
serious import no wonder he thought if
courted by the son a proud and powerful
baron she can no longer spare a word
or look to the poor fortuneless page
in a word roland graeme's situation
became truly uncomfortable and his heart
naturally enough rebelled against the injustice
 this treatment which deprived him
 the only comfort which he had received
for submitting to a confinement in other respects
irksome he accused queen mary
and catherine seyton for concerning the
opinion dame fleming he was indifferent
 inconsistency in being displeased
with him on account the natural cones
the abbot
quinces an order their own why
did they send him to hear this overpowering
preacher the abbot ambrosius he
recollected understood the weakness 
their popish cause better when he enjoined
him to repeat within his miiid avert
and credos and paters all the while old
henry warden preached or lectured that
so he might secure himself against lending
even a momentary ear to his heretical
doctrine but i will endure this life no
longer said he to himself manfully j do
they suppose i would betray my mistress
because i see cause to doubt her religion
 that would be a serving as they
say the devil for god's sake i will forth
into the world he that serves fair ladies
may at least expect kind looks and kind
words and i bear not the mind a gentleman
to submit to cold treatment and
suspicion and a lifelong captivity besides
i will speak to george douglas tomorrow
when we go out together fishing
a sleepless night was spent in agitating
the abbot 
this magnanimous resolution and he arose
in the morning not perfectly decided in
his own mind whether he should abide by
it or not it happened that he was summoned
by the queen at an unusual hour
and just as he was about to go out with
george douglas he went to attend her
commands in the garden but as he had
his anglingrod in his hand the circumstance
announced his previous intention
and the queen turning to the lady fleming
said catherine must devise some
other amusement for us ma honneamiey our
discreet page has already made his party
for the day's pleasure
 said from the beginning answered
the lady fleming that your grace ought
not to rely on being favoured with the company
 a youth who has so many huguenot
acquaintances and has the means 
amusing himself far more agreeably than
with us
i wish said catherine her animated
features reddening with mortification that
 the abbot
his friends would sail away with him for
good and bring us in return a page if such
a thing can be found faithful to his queen
and to his religion
 one part your wishes may be granted
madam said roland graeme unable i
any longer to restrain his sense the treatment
which he received on all sides and 
he was about to add i heartily wish you
a companion in my room if such can be
found who is capable enduring women's 
caprices without going distracted luckily
he recollected the remorse which he had i
felt at having given way to the vivacity 
his temper upon a similar occasion and
closing his lips imprisoned until it died on
his tongue a reproach so misbecoming the
presence majesty
 why do you remain there said the
queen as if you were rooted to the parterre

 i but attend your grace's commands
said the page
 i have none to give you begone sir 
the abbot 
as he left the garden to go to the boat
he distinctly heard mary upbraid one her
attendants in these words you see to
what you have exposed us
this brief scene at once determined roland
graeme's resolution to quit the castle
if it were possible and to impart his resolution
to george douglas without loss 
time that gentleman in his usual mood
 silence sate in the stern the little skiff
which they used on such occasions trimming
his fishingtackle and from time to
time indicating by signs to greene who
pulled the oars which way he should row
when they were a furlong or two from the
castle roland rested on the oars and addressed
his companion somewhat abruptly
 i have something importance to say to
you under your pleasure fair sir
the pensive melancholy douglas's
countenance at once gave way to the eager
keen and startled look one who expects
to hear something deep and alarming
import
 the abbot
i am wearied to the very death this
castle lochleven continued roland
is that all said douglas i know
none its inhabitants who are much better
pleased with it
 ay but i am neither a native the
house nor a prisoner in it and so i may
reasonably desire to leave it
 you might desire to quit it with equal
reason answered douglas if you were
both the one and the other
but said roland greene i am not
only tired living in lochleven castle but
i am determined to quit it
that is a resolution more easily taken
than executed replied douglas
 not if yourself sir and your lady mother
chuse to consent answered the page
 you mistake the matter roland said
douglas you will find that the consent
 two other persons is equally essential 
that the lady mary your mistress and
that my uncle the regent who placed
you about her person and who will not
the abbot 
think it proper that she should change her
attendants so soon
 and must i then remain whether i will
or no demanded the page somewhat appalled
at a view the subject which would
have occurred sooner to a person more
experience
at least said george douglas you
must will to remain till my uncle wills to
dismiss you
 frankly said the page and speaking
to you as a gentleman who is incapable
 betraying me i will confess that if
i thought myself a prisoner here neither
walls nor water should confine me ions
frankly said douglas i could not
much blame you for the attempt yet for
all that my father or uncle or the earl or
any my brothers or in short any the
king's lords into whe hands you fell would
in such a case hang you like a dog or like a
sentinel who deserts his post and i promise
you that you will hardly escape them
but row towards saint serf's island there
 the abbot
is a breeze from the west and we will have
sport keeping to windward the isle where
the ripple is strongest we will speak more
 what you have mentioned when we have
had an hour's sport
their fishing was successful though never
did two anglers pursue even that silent
and unsocial pleasure with less verbal intercourse

when their time was expired douglas
took the oars in his turn and by his order
roland greene steered the boat directing
her course upon the landingplace at the
castle but he also stopped in the midst 
his course and looking around him said to
graeme there is a thing which i could
mention to thee but it is so deep a secret
that even here surrounded as we are by sea
and sky without the possibility a listener
i cannot prevail on myself to speak it out
 better leave it unspoken sir answered
roland greene if you doubt the honour
 him who alone can hear it
 i doubt not your honour replied
the abbot 
george douglas but you are young imprudent
and changeful
 young said roland i am and it
may be imprudent but who hath informed
you that i am changeful 
 one that knows you perhaps better
than you know yourself replied douglas
i suppose you mean catherine seyton
said the page his heart rising as he spoke j
 but she is herself fifty times more variable
in her humour than the very water which
we are floating upon
 my young acquaintance said douglas
 i pray you to remember that catherine
seyton is a lady blood and birth and
must not be lightly spoken 
mastergeorgeof douglassaidgrame
 as that speech seemed to be made under
the warrant something like a threat i pray
you to observe that i value not the threat
at the estimation a fin one these
dead trouts and moreover i would have
you to know that the champion who undervol
 n
 the abbot
takes the defence every lady blood
and birth whom men accuse change 
faith and fashion is like to have enough
 work on his hands
go to said the seneschal but in a
tone good humour thou art a foolish
boy unfit to deal with any matter more serious
than the casting a net or the flying
 a hawk
 if your secret concern catherine seyton
said the page i care not for it and
so you may tell her if you will i wot she
can shape you opportunity to speak with
her as she has ere now
the flush which passed over douglas's
face made the page aware that he had
lighted on a truth when he was in fact
speaking at random and the feeling that
he had done so was like striking a dagger
into his own heart his companion without
farther answer resumed the oars and
pulled lustily till they arrived at the island
and the castle the servants received the
produce their spoil and the two fishers
the abbot 
turning from each other in silence went
each to his several apartment
roland graeme had spent about an hour
in grumbling against catherine seyton the
queen the regent and the whole house
 lochleven with george douglas at the
head it when the time approached that
his duty called him to attend the meal 
queen mary as he arranged his dress for
this purpose he grudged the trouble which
on similar occasions he used with boyish
foppery to consider as one the most important
duties his day and when he
went to take his place behind the chair 
the queen it was with an air offended
dignity which could not escape her observation
and probably appeared to her ridiculous
enough for she whispered something
in french to her ladies at which the lady
fleming laughed and catherine appeared
half diverted and half disconcerted this
pleasantry which the subject was concealed
from him the unfortunate page 
the abbot
civet course as a new offence and
called an additional degree sullen dignity
into his mien which might have exposed
him to farther raillery but that mary appeared
disposed to make allowance for and
compassionate his feelings
with the peculiar tact and delicacy which
no woman possessed in greater perfection
she began to sooth by degrees the vexed
spirit her magnanimous attendant the
excellence the fish which he had taken
in his expedition the high flavour and
beautiful red colour the trouts which
have long given distinction to the lake led
her first to express her thanks to her attendant
for so agreeable an addition to her table
especially upon i jour che jeune and then
brought on enquiries into the place where
the fish had been taken their size their peculiarities
the times when they were in season
and a comparison between the lochleven
trouts and those which are found in
the lakes and rivers the south scotthe
abbot 
land the ill humour roland giccrae
was never an obstinate character it rolled
away like mist before the sun and he
was easily engaged in a keen and animated
dissertation about lochleven trout and sea
trout and river trout and bull trout and
char which never rise to a lily and par
which some suppose infant salmon and
herrings which frequent the nith and vena
kisses which are only found in the castlewood
 lochmaben and he was hurrying
on with the eager impetuosity and enthusiasm
 a young sportsman when he observed
that the smile with which the queen at
first listened to him died languidly away and
that in spite her efforts to suppress them
tears rose to her eyes he stopped suddenly
short and distressed in his turn asked
if he had had the misfortune unwittingly
to give displeasure to her grace 
no my poor boy replied the queen 
but as you numbered up the lakes and
rivers my kingdom imagination cheated
me as it will do and snatched me
 the abbot
from these dreary walls away to the romantic
streams nithsdale and the royal
towers lochmaben o land which my
fathers have so long ruled the pleasures
which you extend so freely your queen is
now deprived and the poorest beggar who
may wander free from one landward town
to another would scorn to change fates with
mary scotland j
 your highness said the lady fleming
 will do well to withdraw
come with me then fleming said 
the queen i would not burthen hearts
so young as these are with the sight my
sorrows
she accompanied these words with a look
 melancholy compassion towards roland
and catherine who were now left alone together
in the apartment
the page found his situation not a little 
embarrassing for as every reader has expel
pierced who may have chanced to be in such
a situation it is extremely difficult to maintain
the full dignity an offended person
the abbot 
in the presence a beautiful girl whatever
reason we may have for being angry with
her catherine seyton on her part sate
still like a lingering ghost which conscious
 the awe which its presence imposes is
charitably disposed to give the poor confused
mortal whom it visits time to recover
his senses and comply with the grand rule
 damonology by speaking first but as
roland seemed in no hurry to avail himself
 her condescension she carried it a step
farther and herself opened the conversation

 i pray you fair sir if it may be permitted
me to disturb your august reverie
by a question so simple what may have
become your rosary 
it is lost madam lost sometime since
said roland partly embarrassed and partly
indignant
 and may i ask farther sir said catherine
 why you have not replaced it
with another i have half a mind she
said taking from her pocket a string ebon
the abbot
ny beads adorned with gold to bestow
one upon you to keep for my sake just to
remind you former acquaintance
there was a little tremulous accent in
the tone with which these words were delivered
which at once put to flight roland
graeme's resentment and brought him to
catherine's side but she instantly resumed
the bold and firm accent which was more
familiar to her i did not bid you she
said come and sit so close by me for the
acquaintance that i spoke has been stiff
and cold dead and buried for this many a
day
 now heaven forbid i said the page 
it has only slept and now that you desire
it should awake fair catherine believe me
that a pledge your returning favour
 nay nay said catherine withholding
the rosary towards which as he spoke he
extended his hand have changed my
mind on better reflection what should a
heretic do with these holy beads that have
been blessed by the father the church
himself
the abbot 
roland winced grievously for he saw
plainly which way the discourse was now
likely to tend and felt that it must at all
events be embarrassing nay but he
said it was as a token your own regard
that you offered them
 ay fair sir but that regard attended
the faithful subject the loyal and pious catholic
the individual who was so solemnly
devoted at the same time with myself to
the same grand duty which you must now
understand was to serve the church and
the queen to such a person if you ever
heard him was my regard due and not
to him who associates with heretics and is
about to become a renegado
 i should scarce believe fair mistress
said roland indignantly that the vane
 your favour turned only to a catholic
wind considering that it points so plainly
to george douglas who i think is both
kinsman and protestant
think better george douglas said
catherine than to believe and then
n 
 the abbot
checking herself as if she had spoken too
much she went on i assure you fair
mr roland that all who wish you well are
sorry for you
their number is very few i believe
answered roland and their sorrow if
they feel any not deeper than ten minutes
time will cure
 they are more numerous and think
more deeply concerning you than you seem
to be aware answered catherine but
perhaps they think wrong you are the
best judge for yourself and if you prefer
gold and church lands to honour and loyalty
and the faith your fathers why should
you be hampered in conscience more than
others 
may heaven bear witness for me
said roland that if i entertain any difference
 opinion that is if i nourish any
doubts in point religion they have been
adopted on the conviction my own mind
and the suggestion my conscience 
ay ay your conscience your conthe
abbot 
science repeated she with satiric emphasis
y your conscience is the scapegoat i
warrant it an able one it will bear the burthen
 one the bestmanorsof the abbey
 saint mary's kennaquhair lately forfeited
to our noble lord the king by the
abbot and community thereof for the
high crime fidelity to their religious vows
and now to be granted by the high and
mighty traitor and so forth james earl
 murray to the good squire dames
roland graeme for his loyal and faithful
service as underespial and deputyturnkey
for securing the person his lawful
sovereign queen mary
 you misconstrue me cruelly said the
page yes catherine most cruelly god
knows i would protect this poor lady at the
risk my life or with my life but what can
i do what can any one do for her 
 much may be done enough may be
done all may be doneif men will be
but true and honourable as scottish men
were in the days bruce and wallace o
roland from what an enterprize you are now
soo the abbot
withdrawing your heart and hand through
mere fickleness and coldness spirit 
 how can i withdraw said roland
from an enterprize which has never been
communicated to me has the queen or
have you or has any one communicated
with me upon any thing for her service
which i have refused or have you not
all you held me at such distance from
your counsels as if i were the most faithless
spy since the days gallon 
and who said catherine seyton
 would trust the sworn friend and pupil
and companion the heretic preacher
henderson ay a proper tutor you have
chosen instead the excellent ambrosius
who is naw turned out house and
homestead if indeed he is not languishing
in a dungeon for withstanding the tyranny
 morton to whose brother the temporalities
 that noble house god have
been gifted away by the regent
 is it possible said the page j and is
the excellent father ambrose in such distress

the abbot 
he would account the news your
falling away from the faith your fathers
answered catherine a worse mishap than
aught that tyranny can inflict on himself
but why said roland very much
moved should you suppose that that 
that it is with me as you say 
 do you yourself deny it replied catherine
do you not admit that you have drank
the poison which you should have dashed
from your lips do you deny that it now
ferments in your veins if it has not altogether
corrupted the springs life do yau
deny that you have your doubts as you
proudly term them respecting what papes
and councils have declared it unlawful to
doubt is not your faith wavering if not
overthrown does not the heretic preacher
boast his conquest does not the heretic
woman this prisonhouse hold up thy
example to others do not the queen
and the lady fleming believe in thy falling
away and is there any except oneyes
i will speak it out and think as lightly
 the abbot
as you please my good will is there one
except myself that holds even a lingering
hope that you may yet prove what we once
all believed you 
 i know not said our poor page much
embarrassed by the view which was thus presented
to him the conduct he was expected
to pursue and by a person in whom he
was not the less interested that so long
residence in lochleven castle with no object
so likely to attract his undivided attention
had taken place since since they had
first met i know not what you expect
 me or fear from me was sent hitherto
attend queen mary and to her i acknowledge
the duty a servant through
life and death if any one had expected
service another kind i was not the party
to render it i neither avow nor disclaim
the doctrines the reformed church will
you have the truth it seems to me that
the profligacy the catholic clergy has
brought this judgment on their own heads
and for aught i know it may be for their
the abbot 
reformation but for betraying this unhappy
queen god knows i am guiltless 
the thought did i believe worse her
than as her servant i wish as her subject
i dare to do i would not betray her 
far from it i would aid her in aught which
could tend to a fair trial her cause
enough enough answered catherine
clasping her hands together then thou
wilt not desert us if any means are presented
by which placing our royal mistress at
freedom this case may be honestly tried
betwixt her and her rebellious subjects
nay but fair catherine replied the
page hear but what the lord murray
said when he sent me hither
 hear but what the devil said replied
the maiden rather than what a false subject
a false brother a false counsellor a
false friend said a man raised from a petty
pensioner on the crown's bounty to bethe
counsellor majesty and the prime
distributor the bounties the state 
sod the abbor
one with whom rank fortune title consequence
and power all grew up like a mushroom
by the mere warm good will the
sister whom in requital he hath mewed
up in this place melancholy seclusion 
whom in further requital he has deposed
and whom if he dared he would murder
i think not so ill the earl murray
said roland graeme and sooth to
speak he added with a slight smile it
would require some bribe to make me embrace
with firm and desperate resolution
either one side or the other
 nay if that is all replied catherine
seyton in a tone enthusiasm you shall
be guerdon with prayers from oppressed
subjects from dispossessed clergy from
insulted nobles with immortal praise by
future ages with eager gratitude by the
present with fame an earth and with felicity
in heaven your country will thank
you your queen will be debtor to you 
you will achieve at once the highest from
the abbot 
the lowest degree in chivalry all men will
honour all women will love you and i
sworn with you so early to the accomplishment
 queen mary's freedom will yes
i will love you better than ever sister loved
brother
say on say on said poland kneeling
on one knee and taking her hand which
in the warmth her exhortation catherine
held towards him
nay said she pausing i have already
said too much far too much if i
prevail not with you far too little if i do
but i prevail lie continued seeing that
the countenance the youth she addressed
returned the enthusiasm her own i
prevail or rather the good cause prevails
through its own strength thus i devote
thee to it and as she spoke she approached
her finger to the brow the astonished
youth and without touching it signed the
cross over his forehead stooped her face
towards him and seemed to kiss the empty
space in which she had traced the symbol j
 the abbot
then starting up and extricating herself
from his grasp darted into the queen's
apartment
koland graeme remained as the enthusiastic
maiden had left him kneeling on one
knee with breath withheld and with eyes
fixed upon the space which the fairy form
 catherine seyton had so lately occupied
if his thoughts were not unmixed delight
they at least partook that thrilling
and intoxicating though mingled sense
 pain and pleasure the most overpowering
which life offers in its blended cup he
rose and retired slowly and although the
chaplain mr henderson preached on that
evening his best sermon against the errors
 popery i would not engage that he was
followed accurately through the train his
reasoning by the young proselyte with a
view to whose especial benefit he had handled
the subject
the abbot 
chapter x
and when love's torch hath set the heart in flame
comes signor reason with his saws and cautions
giving such aid as the old greybeard sexton
who from the church vault drags his crazy engine
to ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet
against a conflagration
old play
in a musing mood roland graeme upon
the ensuing morning betook himself to the
battlements the castle as a spot where
he might indulge the course his thickcoming
fancies with least chance interruption
but his place retirement was
in the present case ill chosen for he was
presently joined by master elias henderson

 i sought you young man said the
preacher having to speak something
which concerns you nearly
the page had no pretence for avoiding
the conference which the chaplain thus 
 the abbot
feared though he felt that it might prove an
embarrassing one
 in teaching thee as far as my feeble
knowledge hath permitted thy duty towards
god said the chaplain there are
particulars your duty towards man upon
which i was unwilling long or much to insist
you are here in the service a lady
honourable as touching her birth deserving
 all compassion as respects her misfortunes
and garnished with even but too
many those outward qualities which win
men's regard and affection have you ever
considered your regard to this lady mary
 scotland in its true light and bearing 
 i trust reverend sir replied roland
graeme that i am well aware the duties
a servant in my condition owes to his
royal mistress especially in her lowly and
distressed condition
true answered the preacher but it
is even that honest feeling which may in
the lady mary's case carry thee into great
crime and treachery
the abbot 
 how so reverend sir replied the
page i profess i understand you not
i speak to you not the crimes this
illadvised lady said the preacher they
are not subjects for the ears her sworn
servant but it is enough to say that this
unhappy person hath rejected more offers 
grace more hopes glory than ever were
held out to earthly princes and that she is
now her day favour being passed sequestered
in this lonely castle for the commonweal
 the people scotland and it maybe
for the benefit her own soul
 reverend sir said roland somewhat
impatiently i am but too well aware that
my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned since
i have the misfortune to share in her restraint
myself which to speak sooth i
am heartily weary
 it is even that which i am about to
speaksaid the chaplain mildly but first
my good roland look forth on the pleasant
prospect yonder cultivated plain you see
where the smoke arises yonder village 
the abbot
ing half hidden by the trees and you know it
to be the dwellingplace peace and industry
from space to space each by the side 
its own stream you see the gray towers 
barons with cottages interspersed and you
know that they also with their household
are now living in unity the lance hung up on
the wall and the sword resting in its sheath
you see too more than one fair church
where the pure waters life are offered to
the thirsty and where the hungry are refreshed
with spiritual food what would
he deserve who should bring fire and
slaughter into so fair and happy a scene 
who should bare the swords the gentry
and turn them against each other who
should give tower and cottage to the flames
and slake the embers with the blood the
indwellers what would he deserve who
should lift up again that ancient dagon 
superstition whom the worthies the time
have beaten down and who should once
more make the churches god the high
places baal 
the abbot 
 you have limned a frightful picture
reverend sir said roland greene yet i
guess not whom you would charge with the
purpose effecting a change so horrible
 god forbid replied the preacher that
 should say to thee thou art the man 
yet beware roland graeme that thou in
serving thy mistress hold fast the still higher
service which thou west to the peace thy
country and the prosperity her inhabitants
 else roland gramme thou mayest bethe
very man upon whose head will fall the
curses and assured punishment due to such
work ifthou art won by the song these syrens
to aid that unhappy lady's escape from
this place penitence and security it is
over with the peace scotland's cottages
and with the prosperity her palaces and
the babe unborn shall curse the name the
man who gave inlet to the disorder which
will follow the war betwixt the mother and
the son
 i know no such plan reverend sir
 the abbot
answered the page and therefore can aid
none such my dirty towards the queen
has been simply that an attendant it is
a task which at times i would willingly
have been freed nevertheless 
 it is to prepare thee for the enjoyment
 something more liberty said the
preacher that i have endeavoured to impress
upon you the deep responsibility under
which your office must be discharged
george douglas hath told the lady loch
leven that you are weary this service and
my intercession hath partly determined her
good ladyship that as your discharge cannot
be granted you shall instead be employed
in certain commissions on the mainland
which have hitherto been discharged
by other persons confidence wherefore
come with me to the lady for even today
such duty will be imposed on you
 i trust you will hold me excused reverend
sir said the page who felt that an
increase confidence on the part the
the abbot 
lady the castle and her family would
render his situation in a moral view doubly
embarrassing one cannot serve two masters
 and i much fear that my mistress will
not hold me excused for taking employment
under another
 dear not that said the preacher her
consent shall be asked and obtained i fear
she will yield it but too easily as hoping to
avail herself your agency to maintain
correspondence with her friends as those
falsely call themselves who would make
her name the watch word for civil war
 and thus said the page i will be
exposed to suspicion on all sides for my
mistress will consider me as a spy placed on
her by her enemies seeing me so far trusted
by them and the lady lochleven will
never cease to suspect the possibility my
betraying her because circumstances put it
into my power to do so i would rather remain
as i am
there followed a pause one or two
minutes during which henderson looked
vol ir o
 the abbot
steadily in roland's countenance as if desirous
to ascertain whether there was not
more in the answer than the precise words
seemed to imply he failed in this point
however for roland bred a page from
childhood knew how to assume a sullen
petted cast countenance well enough
calculated to hide all internal emotions
 i understand thee not roland said
the preacher or rather thou thickest on
this matter more deeply than i apprehended
to be in thy nature methought the
delight going on shore with thy bow or
thy gun or thy anglingrod would have
borne away all other feelings
 and so it would replied roland who
perceived the danger suffering henderson's
half raised suspicions to become fully
awake i would have thought nothing
but the gun and the oar and the wild waterfowl
that tempt me by sailing among
the sedges yonder so far out flightshot
had you not spoken my going on shore
as what was to occasion burning town
the abbot 
and tower the downfall the evangelic
and the up setting the mass
 follow me then said henderson
 and we will seek the lady lochleven
they found her at breakfast with her
grandson george douglas peace be with
your ladyship said the preacher bowing
to his patroness roland graeme awaits
your order
 young man said the lady our
chaplain hath warranted for thy fidelity
and we are determined to give you certain
errands to do for us in our town kinross
 not by my advice said douglas coldly
 i said not that it was answered the lady
something sharply the mother thy
father may i should think be old enough
to judge for herself in a matter so simple
thou wilt take the skiff roland and two
 my people whom clydesdale or randal
will order out and fetch off certain stuff 
plate and hangings which should last night
be lodged at kinross by the wains from
edinburgh
s the abbot
and give this packet said george
douglas to a servant ours whom you
will find in waiting there it is the report
to my father he added looking towards
the grandmother who acquiesced by bending
her head
i have already mentioned to master
henderson said roland graeme that
as my duty requires my attendance on the
queen her grace's permission for my journey
ought to be obtained before i can undertake
your commission
 look to it my son said the old lady
the scruple the youth is honourable
craving your pardon madam i have
no wish to force myself on her presence
thus early said douglas in an indifferent
tone j it might displease her and were noway
agreeable to me
and i said the lady lochleven although
her temper hath been more gentle
 late have no will to undergo without
necessity the rancour her wit
 under your permission madam said
the abbot 
the chaplain i will myself render your
request to the queen during my long residence
in this house she hath not deigned
to see me in private or to hear my doctrine
 yet so may heaven prosper my labours
as love for her soul and desire to
bring her into the right path was my chief
desire for coming hither
take care master henderson said
douglas in a tone which seemed almost
sarcastic lest you rush hastily on an adventure
to which you have no vocation 
you are learned and know the adage ne
aceesseris in consilium nisi vocat who
hath required this at your hand 
the master to whose service i am called
answered the preacher looking upward
 he vho hath commanded me to
be earnest in season and out season
 your acquaintance hath not been much
i think with courts or princes continued
the young esquire
 no sir replied henderson but
 the abbot
ike my master knox i see nothing frightful
in the fair face a pretty lady
my son said the lady lochleven
 quench not the good man's zeal let him
do the errand to this unhappy princess
 with more willingness than i would
do it myself said george douglas yet
something in his manner appeared to con 
tract his words 
the minister went accordingly and demanding
an audience the imprisoned
princess was admitted he found her with
her ladies engaged in the daily task embroidery
the queen received him with 
that courtesy which in ordinary cases she j
used towards all who approached her and 
the clergyman in opening his commission
was obviously somewhat more embarrassed
than he had expected to be the good
lady lochleven may it please your
grace
he made a short pause during which
mary said with a smile my grace would
the abbot 
in truth be well pleased were the lady
lochleven our good lady but go on 
what is the will the good lady lochleven

 she desires madam said the chaplain
 that your grace will permit this young
gentleman your page roland grme to
pass to kinross to look after some household
stuff and hangings sent hither for the
better furnishing your grace's apartments
the lady lochleven said the
queen uses needless ceremony in requesting
our permission for that which
stands within her own pleasure we well
know that this young gentleman's attendance
on us had not been so long permitted
were he not thought to be more at the command
 that good lady than at ours but
we cheerfully yield consent that he shall goon
her errand with our will we would doom
no living creature to the captivity which
we ourselves must suffer
 ay madam answered the preacher
 and it is doubtless natural for humanity
s the abbot
to quarrel with its prisonhouse yet there
have been those who have found that time
spent in the house temporal captivity
may be so employed as to redeem us from
spiritual slavery
i apprehend your meaning sir replied
the queen but i have heard your
apostle i have heard master john knox 
aim were i to be perverted i would willingly
resign to the ablest and most powerful 
heresiarchs the poor honour he might acquire
by overcoming my faith and my
hope
 madam said the preacher it is not
to the talents or skill the husbandman
that god gives the increase the words
which were offered in vain by him whom
you justly call our apostle during the bustle
and gaiety a court may yet find better
acceptance during e leisure for reflection
which this place affords god knows
lady that i speak in singleness heart
as one who would as soon compare himself
to the immortal angels as to the holy man
the abbot si
whom you have named yet would you
but condescend to apply to their noblest
use those talents and that learning which
all allow you to be possessed would
you afford us but the slightest hope that
you would hear and regard what can be
urged against the blinded superstition and
idolatry in which you are brought up sure
am i that the most powerfully gifted my
brethren that even john knox himself
would hasten hither and account the rescue
 your single soul from the nets romish
error
 i am obliged to you and o them for
their charity said mary bu as i have
at present but one presencechamber i
will reluctantly see it converted into a huguenot
synod
 at least madam be not thus obstinately
blinded in your errors hear one who
has hungered and thirsted watched and
prayed to undertake the good work your
conversion and who would be content to
die the instant that a work so advantageous
 the abbot
for yourself and so beneficial to scotland
were accomplished yes lady could i but
shake the remaining pillar the heathen
temple in this land and that permit me to
term your faith in the delusions rome 
i could be content to die overwhelmed in
the ruins
 i will not insult your zeal sir replied
mary by saying you are more likely to
make sport for the philistines than to overwhelm
them your charity claims my
thanks for it is warmly expressed and maybe
truly purposed but believe as well 
me as i am willing to do you and think
that i may be as anxious to recal you to the
ancient and only road as you are to teach
me your new byeways to paradise
 then madam if such be your generous
purpose said henderson eagerly what
hinders that we should dedicate some part
 that time unhappily now too much at
cour grace's disposal to discuss a question
so weighty you by report all men are
both learned and witty and i though withthe
abbot 
c
out such advantage am strong in my cause
as in a tower defence why should we
not spend some space in endeavouring to
discover which us hath the wrong side
in this most important matter 
nay said queen mary i never alleged
my force was strong enough to accept
 a combat en champ clos with a scholar
and a polemic besides the match is not
equal you sir might retire when you felt
the battle go against you while i am tied
to the stake and have no permission to say
the debate wearies me i would be alone
she curtsied low to him as she uttered
these words and henderson whose zeal
was indeed ardent but did not extend to
the neglect delicacy bowed in return
and prepared to withdraw
 i would he said that my earnest
wish my most zealous prayer could procure
to your grace any blessing or comfort
but especially that in which alone
blessing or comfort is as easily as the slighted
ths abbot
est intimation your wish will remove me
from your presence
he was in the act departing when
mary said to him with much courtesy
do me no injury in your thoughts good
sir j it may be that if my time here be protracted
longer as surely i hope it will not
trusting that either my rebel subjects will repent
 their disloyalty or that my faithful
lieges will obtain the upper hand but if my
time be here protracted it may be i shall
have no displeasure in hearing one who seems
so reasonable and compassionate as yourself
and i may hazard your contempt by endeavouring
to recollect and repeat the reasons
which schoolmen and councils give for the
faith that is in me although i fear that
god help mee my latin has deserted me
with my other possessions this must however
be for another day meanwhile sir let
the lady lochleven employ my page as
she lists i will not afford suspicion by speaking
a word to him before he goes roland
the abbot 
greeme my friend lose not an opportunity
 amusing thyself dance sing run and
leap all may be done merrily on the mainland
 but he must have more than quicksilver
in his vins who could frolic here
 alas madam said the preacher to
what is it you exhort the youth while time
passes and eternity summons can our
salvation be insured by idle mirth or our
good work wrought out without fear and
trembling 
 i cannot fear or tremble replied the
queen to mary stuart such emotions
are unknown but if weeping and sorrow
on my part will atone for the boy enjoying
an hour boyish pleasure be assured the
penance shall be duly paid
nay but gracious lady said the
preacher in this you greatly err our
tears and our sorrows are all too little for
our own fauns and follies nor can we transfer
them as your church falsely teaches to
the benefit others
 may pray you sir answered the
 the abbot
queen with as little offence as such a
prayer may import to transfer yourself elsewhere
we are sick at heart and may not
now be disturbed with farther controversy
and thou roland take this little purse 
then turning to the divine she said shewing
its contents look reverend sir it
contains only these two or three gold festoons
a coin which though bearing my own
poor features i have ever found more active
against me than on my side just as my subjects
take arms against me with my own
name for their summons and signal take
this purse that thou mayest want no means
 amusement fail not fail not to bring
me back news from kinross only let it be
such as without suspicion or offence maybe
told in the presence this reverend
gentleman or the good lady lochleven 
herself
the last hint was too irresistible to be
withstood and henderson withdrew half
mortified half pleased with his reception
for mary from long habit and the address
the abbot 
which was natural to her had learned in an
extraordinary degree the art evading
discourse which was disagreeable to her
feelings or prejudices without affronting
those by whom it was proffered
roland graeme retired with the chaplain
at a signal from his lady but it did not
escape him that as he left the room stepping
backwards and making the deep obeisance
due to royalty catherine seyton held
up her slender forefinger with a gesture
which he alone could witness and which
seemed to say remember what has passed
betwixt us
roland greene had now his last charge
from the lady lochleven there are
revels she said this day at the village 
my son's authority is as yet unable to prevent
these continued workings the ancient
leaven folly which the romish
priests have kneaded into the very souls 
the scottish peasantry t do not command
thee to abstain from them that would be
only to lay a snare for thy folly or to teach
 the abbot
thee falsehood but enjoy these vanities
with moderation and mark them as what
thou must soon learn to renounce and contemn
our chamberlain at kinross luke
lundin doctor as he foolishly calleth
himself will acquaint thee what is to be
done in the matter about which thou goes
remember thou art trusted shew thyself
therefore worthy trust
when we recollect that roland graeme
was not yet nineteen and that he had spent
his whole life in the solitary castle avenel
excepting the few hours he had passed in
edinburgh and his late residence at lochleven
the latter period having very little
served to enlarge his acquaintance with the
gay world we cannot wonder that his heart
beat high with hope and curiosity at the
hope partaking the sport even a country
wake he hastened to his little cabin
and turned over the wardrobe with which
in every respect becoming his station
he had been supplied from edinburgh
probably by order the earl murray
the abbot 
by the queen's command he had hitherto
waited upon her in mourning or at least in
sadcoloured raiment her condition she
said admitted nothing more gay but
now he selected the gayest dress his wardrobe
afforded composed scarlet slashed
with black satin the royal colours 
scotland combed his long curled hairdisposed
his chain and medal round a beaver
hat the newest block and with the
gay falchion which had reached him in so
mysterious a manner hung by his side in
an embroidered belt his apparel added to
his natural frank mien and handsome form
made a most commendable and pleasing
specimen the young gallant the period
he sought to make his parting reverence to
the queen and her ladies but old clydesdale
hurried him to the boat
 we will have no private audiences he
said my master since you are to be trusted
with somewhat we will try at least to
save thee from the temptation opportunity
god help thee child he added with
 the abbor
a glance contempt at his gay clothes
 an the bearward be yonder from saint
andrews have a care thou go not near
him
 and wherefore i pray you said roland

lest he take thee for one his runaway
jack anapes answered the steward
smiling sourly
i wear not my clothes at thy cost said
roland indignantly
nor at thine own either my son replied
the steward else would thy garb
better resemble thy merit
roland graeme suppressed with difficulty
the repartee which arose to his lips and
wrapping his scarlet mantle around him
threw himself into the boat which two
rowers themselves urged by curiosity to
see the revels pulled stoutly towards the
west the lake as they put off roland
thought he could discover the face 
catherine seyton though carefully withdrawn
from observation peeping from a
the abbot 
loophole to view his departure he pulled
off his hat and held it up as a token that
he saw and wished her adieu a white kerchief
waved for a second across the window
and for the rest the little voyage the
thoughts catherine seyton disputed
ground in his breast with the expectations
excited by the approaching revel as they
approached nigher and nigher to the shore
the sounds mirth and music the laugh
the halloo and the shout came thicker upon
the ear and in a trice the boat was moored
and roland graeme hastened in quest 
the chamberlain that being informed what
time he had to his own disposal he might
lay it out to the best advantage
s the abbor
chapter xl
room for the master the ring ye swains
divide your crowded ranks before him march

the clamorous warpipe and farechoing horn

no long space intervened ere roland
graeme was able to discover among the
crowd revellers who gambollel upon the
open space which extends betwixt the village
and the lake a person so great importance
as doctor luke lundin upon
whom devolved officially the charge representing
the lord the land and who
was attended for support his authority
by a piper a drummer and four sturdy
clowns armed with rusty halberds garnished
with partycoloured ribbands myrmidons
who early as the day was had althe
abbot 
ready broken more than one head in the
awful names the laird lochleven and
his chamberlain
as soon as this dignitary was informed
that the castle skiff had arrived with a gallant
dressed like a lord's son at the least
who desired presently to speak with him
he adjusted his ruff and his black coat
turned round his girdle till the garnished
hilt his long rapier became visible and
walked with due solemnity towards the
beach solemn indeed he was entitled to
be even on less important occasions for he
had been bred to the venerable study medicine
as those acquainted with the science
very soon discovered from the aphorisms
which ornamented his discourse his success
had not been equal to his pretensions 
but as he was a native the neighbouring
kingdom fife and bore distant relation
to or dependance upon the ancient
family lundin that ilk who were
bound in close friendship with the house
 lochleven he had through their inter
the abbot
rest got planted comfortably enough in his
present station upon the banks that beautiful
lake the profits his chamberlain
being moderate especially in these unsettled
times he had eked it out a little with some
practice in his original profession and it
was said that the inhabitants the village
and barony kinross were not more effectually
whirled which may be translated
enthralled to the baron's mill than they
were to the medical monopoly the chamberlain
woe betide the family the rich
boor who presumed to depart this life without
a passport from doctor luke lundin 
for if his representatives had aught to settle
with the baron as it seldom happened otherwise
they were sure to find a cold friend
in the chamberlain he was considerate
enough however gratuitously to help the
poor out their ailments and sometimes
out all their other distresses at the same
time
formal in a double proportion both asa
physician and as a person in office and
the abbot sb
proud the scraps learning which rendered
his language almost universally unintelligible
doctor luke lundin approached
the beach and hailed the page as he advanced
towards him the freshness the
morning upon you fair sir you are sent
i warrant me to see if we observe here the
regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed
for eschewing all superstitious ceremonies
and idle abilities in these our
revels i am aware that her good ladyship
would willingly have altogether abolished
and abrogated them but as i had
the honour to quote to her from the works
 the learned hercules saxony finis

latin ad imguem every cure must be
wrought either by art and induction rule

vulgar mind will be defeated and purged

i have no charge doctor lundin
replied the page
call me not doctor said the chamberlain
 since i have laid aside my furred
gown and bonnet and retired me into this
temporality chamberlainship
o sire said the page who was no
stranger by report to the character this
original the cowl makes not the monk
neither the cord the friar we have all heard
 the cures wrought by doctor lundin
toys young sir trifles answered the
leech with grave disclamation superior
skill the hitremiss practice a poor
the abbot 
retired gentleman in a short cloak and
doublet marry heaven sent its blessing
and this i must say better fashioned medicines
have brought fewer patients through
longa rohha cora scientia saith the italian
 ha fair sir you have the language 
roland greeme did not think it necessary
to expound to this learned theban
whether he understood him or no but
leaving that matter uncertain he told him
he came in quest certain packages which
should have arrived at kinross and been
placed under the chamberlain's charge the
evening before
 body o me said doctor lundin i
fear our common carrier john auchter
muchty hath met with some mischance
that he came not up last night with his
pains bad land this to journey in my
master and the fool will travel by night too
although besides all maladies from your
tussis to your destiny which walk abroad in
the night air he may well fall in with half
vol n p
s the abbot
a dozen swashbucklers who will ease him
at once his baggage and his earthly complaints
i must send forth to enquire after
him since he hath stuff the honourable
household on hand and by our lady he
hath stuff mine too certain drugs sent
me from the city for composition my
alexipharmics this gear must be looked
to hodge said he addressing one his
redoubled bodyguard do thou and
toby telford take the mickle brown aver
and the black cuttailed mare and make
out towards the keirycraigs and see what
tidings you can have auchtermuchty
and his pains i trust it is only the medicine
 the pottlepot being the only nedu
tarentum which the beast useth which hath
caused him to tarry on the road take the
ribbands from your halberds you knaves
and get on your jacks platesleeves and
knapscuils that your presence may work
some terror if you meet with opposers
he then added turning to roland graeme
 i warrant me we shall have news the
the abbot 
pains in brief season meantime it will
please you to look upon the sports but first
to enter my poor lodging and take your
morning's cup for what saith the school
 salerno 
speculum mane haustura
restaurant naturam exhausted
 your learning is too profound for me
replied the page and so would your
draught be likewise i fear
not a whit fair sir a cordial cup 
sack impregnated with wormwood is the
best anti pestilential draught j and to speak
truth the pestilential miasmata are now
very rife in the atmosphere we live in a
happy time young man continued he ina
tone grave irony and have many
blessings unknown to our fathers here
are two sovereigns in the land a regnant
and a claimant that is enough one good
thing but if any one wants more he may
find a king in every peelhouse in the country
 so if we lack government it is not for
want governors then have we a civil
 the abbot
war to refresh us every year and to prevent
our population from starving for want 
food and for the same purpose we have
the plague proposing us a visit the best 
all recipes for thinning a land and converting
younger brothers into elder ones well
each man in his vocation you young fellows
 the sword desire to wrestle fence
or so forth with some expert adversary 
and for my part i love to match myself for
life or death against that same plague
as they proceeded up the street the
little village towards the doctor's lodgings
his attention was successively occupied by
the various personages whom he met and
pointed out to the notice his companion
do you see that fellow with the red
bonnet the blue jerkin and the great rough
barton in his hand i believe that clown
hath the strength a tower he has lived
fifty years in the world and never encouraged
the liberal sciences by buying one
pennyworth medicaments but see you
that man with the fades hippocrates v said
the abbot 
he pointing out a thin peasant with swelled
legs and a most cadaverous countenance 
that i call one the worthiest men in
the barony he breakfasts luncheons dines
and sups by my advice and not without my
medicine and for his own single part will
go farther to clear out a moderate stock 
pharmaceutical than half the country besides
 how do you my honest friend 
said he to the party in question with a tone
 condolence
 very weakly sir since i took the electuary
answered the patient it neighboured
ill with the two spoonfuls peaseporridge
and the kernmilk
peaseporridge and kernmilk have you
been under medicine these ten years and
keep your diet so ill the next morning
take the electuary by itself and touch nothing
for six hours the poor object bowed
and shuffled off
the next whom the doctor deigned to
take notice j was a lame fellow by whom
the honour was altogether undeserved for
p 
 the abbot
at sight the medicine he began to shuffle
away in the crowd as fast as his infirmities
would permit
 there is an ungrateful hound for you
said doctor lundin j i cured him the
gout in his feet and now he talks the
agreeableness medicine and makes the
first use his restored legs to fly from his
physician hisjodagra hath become a cki
agra as honest martial hath it the gout
has got into his fingers and he cannot draw
his purse old saying and true
anaemia cum poscit medicis satan est
we are angels when we come to cure devils
when we ask payment but i will administer
a purgation to his purse i warrant
him there is his brother too a sordid
chuff so ho there saunders varlet you
have been ill i hear 
just got the turn as i was thinking to
send to your honour and i am brawly now
again it was nae great thing that ailed
me
the abbot 
hark you sirrah said the doctor i
trust you remember you are owing to the
laird four stones barley meal and a bow
 oats j and i would have you send no more
such kainfowls as you sent last season that
looked as wretchedly as patients just dismissed
from a plaguehospital and there
is hard money owing besides
 i was thinking sir said the man more
scoticoy that is returning no direct answer
on the subject on which he was addressed
my best way would be to come down to
your honour and take your advice yet incase
my trouble should come back
 do so then knave replied lundin
 and remember what ecclesiasticus saith
give place to the physician let him not
go from thee for thou hast need him
his exhortation was interrupted by an
apparition which seemed to strike the doctor
with as much horror and surprise as his
own visage inflicted upon sundry those
persons whom he had addressed
the figure which produced this effect on
 the abbot
the aesculapius the village was that a
tall old woman who wore a highcrowned
hat and muffler the first these habiliments
added apparently to her stature
and the other served to conceal the lower
part her face and as the hat itself was
slouched little could be seen besides two
brown cheekbones and the eyes swarthy
fire that gleamed from under two shaggy
grey eye brows she was dressed in a long
darkcoloured robe unusual fashion bordered
at the skirts and on the stomacher
with a sort white trimming resembling
the jewish phylacteries on which were
wrought the characters some unknown
language she held in her hand a walking
staff black ebony
by the soul celsus said doctor
luke lundin it is old mother nineveh
herself she hath come to beard me within
mine own bounds and in the very execution
 mine office have at thy coat
old woman as the song says hob anster
let her presently be seized and comthe
abbot 
mitted to the tolbooth and if there are any
zealous brethren here who would give the
hag her deserts and duck her as a witch
in the loch i pray let them in no way be
hindered
but the myrmidons doctor lundin
shewed in this case no alacrity to do his
bidding hob anster even ventured to remonstrate
in the name himself and his
brethren to be sure he was to do his
honour's bidding and for a that folks said
about the skill and the witcheries mother
nicneven he would put his trust in
god and his hand on her collar without
dreadful but she was no common spae
wife this mother nicneven like jean joppa
that lived in the briersbaulk she had
lords and lairds that would ruffle for her
there was moncrief tippermalloch that
was popish and the laird carslogie a
kennedy queen's man were in the fair with
wha kennedy how mony swords and bucklers
at their back and they would be sure to
make a breakout if the officers meddled with
s the abbot
the auld popish witch wife who was sewell
friend mair especially as the laird's best
men such as were not in the cattle were
in edinburgh with him and he doubted his
honour the doctor would find over few to
make a good backing if blades were bare
the doctor listened unwillingly to this
prudential counsel and was only comforted
by the faithful promise his satellite that
the old woman should as he expressed
it be ta'en canny the next time she trespassed
on the bounds
 and in that event said the doctor to
his companion fire and faggot shall bethe
best her welcome
this he spoke in hearing the dame
herself who even then and in passing the
doctor shot towards him from under her
grey eyebrows a look the most insulting
and contemptuous superiority
this way continued the physician
this way marshalling his guest into his
lodging take care you stumble not over
the abbot 
a retort for it is hazardous for the ignorant
to walk in the ways art
the page found all reason for the caution
 for besides stuffed birds and lizards
and snakes bottled up and bundles simples
made up and other parcels spread out
to dry and all the confusion not to mention
the confused and sickening smells incidental
to a druggist's stock in trade he
had also to avoid heaps charcoal crucibles
boltheads stoves and the other furniture
 a chemical laboratory
amongst his other philosophical qualities
doctor lundin failed not to be a confused
sloven and his old dame housekeeper whose
life as she said was spent in redding
him up had trotted off to the mart 
gaiety with other and younger folks much
clattering and jangling therefore there was
among jars and bottles and vials ere the
doctor produced the salutiferous potion
which he recommended so strongly and
a search equally long and noisy follows
the abbot
ed among broken cans and cracked pipkin
ere he could bring forth a cup out 
which to drink it both matters being at
length achieved the doctor set the example
to his guest by quaffing off a cup the
cordial and smacking his lips with approbation
as it descended his gullet roland
in turn submitted to swallow the potion
which his host so earnestly recommended
but which he found so insufferably bitter
that he became eager to escape from the
laboratory in search a draught fair
water to expel the taste in spite his
efforts he was nevertheless detained by the
garrulity his host till he gave him some
account mother nicneven
 i care not to speak her said the
doctor in the open air and among the
throng people not for fright like yon
cowardly dog anster but because i would
give no occasion for a fray having no leisure
to look to stabs slashes and broken bones
men call the old hag a prophetess i do
scarce believe she could foretell when a
the abbot 
brood chickens will chip the shell men
say she reads the heavens my black bitch
knows as much them when she sits baying
the moon men pretend the old wretch
is a sorceress a witch and what not liter
nos i will never contradict a rumour which
may bring her to the stake which she so
richly deserves but neither will i believe
that the tales witches which they din into
our ears are aught but knavery cozenage
and old womens fables
in the name heaven what is she
then said the page that you make such
a stir about her 
 she is one those cursed old women
replied the physician who take currently
and impudently upon themselves to act as
advisers and curers the sick on the
strength some trash herbs some
rhyme spells some julep or diet drink
or cordial
 nay go no farther said the page if
they brew cordials evil be their lot and
all their partakers 
vol q
 the abbot
you say well young man said doctor
lundin for mine own part i know no
such pests to the commonwealth as these
old incarnate devils who haunt the chambers
 the brainsick patients that are mad
enough to suffer them to interfere with
disturb and let the regular progress a
learned and artificial cure with their syrups
and their juleps and discords and mithridate
and my lady whatshallcall'ums
powder and worthy dame trachea's pill 
and thus make widows and orphans and
cheat the regular and well studied physician
in order to get the name wise women
and steely neighbours and so forth
but no more on't mother nicneven and
i will meet one day and she shall know
there is danger in dealing with the doctor
it is a true word and many have found
it said the page but under your favour
i would fain walk abroad for a little and
see these sports
 it is well moved said the doctor
 and i too should be showing myself
the abbot 
abroad moreover the pray waits us
young man today totus muscles agit 
 and they sallied forth accordingly
into the mirthful scene

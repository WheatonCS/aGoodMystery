at an
inn was impossible and finding that i was not pressed for time and was
merely making a tour of observation he insisted that i should give him
a day or two at his father's country-seat to which he was going to pass
the holidays and which lay at a few miles distance it is better
than eating a solitary christmas dinner at an inn said he and i can
assure you of a hearty welcome in something of the old-fashioned style
his reasoning was cogent and i must confess the preparation i had seen
for universal festivity and social enjoyment had made me feel a little
impatient of my loneliness i closed therefore at once with his
invitation the chaise drove up to the door and in a few moments i was
on my way to the family mansion of the bracebridges


christmas eve

 saint francis and saint benedight
 blesse this house from wicked wight
 from the night-mare and the goblin
 that is hight good fellow robin
 keep it from all evil spirits
 fairies weezels rats and ferrets
 from curfew time
 to the next prime
 cartwright

it was a brilliant moonlight night but extremely cold our chaise
whirled rapidly over the frozen ground the postboy smacked his whip
incessantly and a part of the time his horses were on a gallop he
knows where he is going said my companion laughing and is eager to
arrive in time for some of the merriment and good cheer of the servants
hall my father you must know is a bigoted devotee of the old school
and prides himself upon keeping up something of old english hospitality
he is a tolerable specimen of what you will rarely meet with nowadays
in its purity the old english country gentleman for our men of fortune
spend so much of their time in town and fashion is carried so much into
the country that the strong rich peculiarities of ancient rural life
are almost polished away my father however from early years took
honest peacham for his textbook instead of chesterfield he determined
in his own mind that there was no condition more truly honorable and
enviable than that of a country gentleman on his paternal lands and
therefore passes the whole of his time on his estate he is a strenuous
advocate for the revival of the old rural games and holiday observances
and is deeply read in the writers ancient and modern who have treated
on the subject indeed his favorite range of reading is among the
authors who flourished at least two centuries since who he insists
wrote and thought more like true englishmen than any of their
successors he even regrets sometimes that he had not been born a few
centuries earlier when england was itself and had its peculiar manners
and customs as he lives at some distance from the main road in rather
a lonely part of the country without any rival gentry near him he has
that most enviable of all blessings to an englishman an opportunity
of indulging the bent of his own humor without molestation being
representative of the oldest family in the neighborhood and a great
part of the peasantry being his tenants he is much looked up to and
in general is known simply by the appellation of the squire a title
which has been accorded to the head of the family since time immemorial
i think it best to give you these hints about my worthy old father to
prepare you for any eccentricities that might otherwise appear absurd


 peacham's complete gentleman 


we had passed for some time along the wall of a park and at length the
chaise stopped at the gate it was in a heavy magnificent old style
of iron bars fancifully wrought at top into flourishes and flowers
the huge square columns that supported the gate were surmounted by the
family crest close adjoining was the porter's lodge sheltered under
dark fir trees and almost buried in shrubbery

the postboy rang a large porter's bell which resounded though the still
frosty air and was answered by the distant barking of dogs with which
the mansion-house seemed garrisoned an old woman immediately appeared
at the gate as the moonlight fell strongly upon her i had a full view
of a little primitive dame dressed very much in the antique taste with
a neat kerchief and stomacher and her silver hair peeping from under a
cap of snowy whiteness she came curtseying forth with many expressions
of simple joy at seeing her young master her husband it seemed was up
at the house keeping christmas eve in the servants hall they could
not do without him as he was the best hand at a song and story in the
household

my friend proposed that we should alight and walk through the park to
the hall which was at no great distance while the chaise should follow
on our road wound through a noble avenue of trees among the naked
branches of which the moon glittered as she rolled through the deep
vault of a cloudless sky the lawn beyond was sheeted with a slight
covering of snow which here and there sparkled as the moonbeams caught
a frosty crystal and at a distance might be seen a thin transparent
vapor stealing up from the low grounds and threatening gradually to
shroud the landscape

my companion looked around him with transport how often said he
have i scampered up this avenue on returning home on school vacations
how often have i played under these trees when a boy i feel a degree of
filial reverence for them as we look up to those who have cherished us
in childhood my father was always scrupulous in exacting our holidays
and having us around him on family festivals he used to direct and
superintend our games with the strictness that some parents do the
studies of their children he was very particular that we should play
the old english games according to their original form and consulted
old books for precedent and authority for every merrie disport yet i
assure you there never was pedantry so delightful it was the policy
of the good old gentleman to make his children feel that home was the
happiest place in the world and i value this delicious home-feeling as
one of the choicest gifts a parent could bestow

we were interrupted by the clamor of a troop of dogs of all sorts and
sizes mongrel puppy whelp and hound and curs of lower degree
that disturbed by the ring of the porter's bell and the rattling of the
chaise came bounding open-mouthed across the lawn

 the little dogs and all tray blanch
 and sweetheart see they bark at me

cried bracebridge laughing at the sound of his voice the bark was
changed into a yelp of delight and in a moment he was surrounded and
almost overpowered by the caresses of the faithful animals

we had now come in full view of the old family mansion partly thrown in
deep shadow and partly lit up by the cold moonshine it was an irregular
building of some magnitude and seemed to be of the architecture of
different periods one wing was evidently very ancient with heavy
stone-shafted bow windows jutting out and overrun with ivy from among
the foliage of which the small diamond-shaped panes of glass glittered
with the moonbeams the rest of the house was in the french taste of
charles the second's time having been repaired and altered as my
friend told me by one of his ancestors who returned with that monarch
at the restoration the grounds about the house were laid out in the
old formal manner of artificial flower-beds clipped shrubberies raised
terraces and heavy stone balustrades ornamented with urns a leaden
statue or two and a jet of water the old gentleman i was told was
extremely careful to preserve this obsolete finery in all its
original state he admired this fashion in gardening it had an air
of magnificence was courtly and noble and befitting good old family
style the boasted imitation of nature in modern gardening had sprung
up with modern republican notions but did not suit a monarchical
government it smacked of the leveling system i could not help smiling
at this introduction of politics into gardening though i expressed some
apprehension that i should find the old gentleman rather intolerant
in his creed frank assured me however that it was almost the only
instance in which he had ever heard his father meddle with politics and
he believed that he had got this notion from a member of parliament who
once passed a few weeks with him the squire was glad of any argument
to defend his clipped yew trees and formal terraces which had been
occasionally attacked by modern landscape gardeners

as we approached the house we heard the sound of music and now and
then a burst of laughter from one end of the building this bracebridge
said must proceed from the servants hall where a great deal of
revelry was permitted and even encouraged by the squire throughout the
twelve days of christmas provided everything was done conformably to
ancient usage here were kept up the old games of hoodman blind shoe
the wild mare hot cockles steal the white loaf bob apple and snap
dragon the yule-clog and christmas candle were regularly burnt and the
mistletoe with its white berries hung up to the imminent peril of all
the pretty housemaids


 the mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens
 at christmas and the young men have the privilege of
 kissing the girls under it plucking each time a berry from
 the bush when the berries are all plucked the privilege
 ceases


so intent were the servants upon their sports that we had to ring
repeatedly before we could make ourselves heard on our arrival being
announced the squire came out to receive us accompanied by his two
other sons one a young officer in the army home on a leave of absence
the other an oxonian just from the university the squire was a fine
healthy-looking old gentleman with silver hair curling lightly round an
open florid countenance in which the physiognomist with the advantage
like myself of a previous hint or two might discover a singular
mixture of whim and benevolence

the family meeting was warm and affectionate as the evening was far
advanced the squire would not permit us to change our travelling
dresses but ushered us at once to the company which was assembled in
a large old-fashioned hall it was composed of different branches of a
numerous family connection where there were the usual proportion of old
uncles and aunts comfortable married dames superannuated spinsters
blooming country cousins half-fledged striplings and bright-eyed
boarding-school hoydens they were variously occupied some at a round
game of cards others conversing around the fireplace at one end of the
hall was a group of the young folks some nearly grown up others of
a more tender and budding age fully engrossed by a merry game and a
profusion of wooden horses penny trumpets and tattered dolls about
the floor showed traces of a troop of little fairy beings who having
frolicked through a happy day had been carried off to slumber through a
peaceful night

while the mutual greetings were going on between young bracebridge and
his relatives i had time to scan the apartment i have called it a hall
for so it had certainly been in old times and the squire had evidently
endeavored to restore it to something of its primitive state over
the heavy projecting fireplace was suspended a picture of a warrior
in armor standing by a white horse and on the opposite wall hung a
helmet buckler and lance at one end an enormous pair of antlers were
inserted in the wall the branches serving as hooks on which to suspend
hats whips and spurs and in the corners of the apartment were
fowling-pieces fishing-rods and other sporting implements the
furniture was of the cumbrous workmanship of former days though some
articles of modern convenience had been added and the oaken floor had
been carpeted so that the whole presented an odd mixture of parlor and
hall

the grate had been removed from the wide overwhelming fireplace to
make way for a fire of wood in the midst of which was an enormous log
glowing and blazing and sending forth a vast volume of light and heat
this i understood was the yule-clog which the squire was particular
in having brought in and illumined on a christmas eve according to
ancient custom


 the yule-clog is a great log of wood sometimes the root
 of a tree brought into the house with great ceremony on
 christmas eve laid in the fireplace and lighted with the
 brand of last year's clog while it lasted there was great
 drinking singing and telling of tales sometimes it was
 accompanied by christmas candles but in the cottages the
 only light was from the ruddy blaze of the great wood fire
 the yule-clog was to burn all night if it went out it was
 considered a sign of ill luck

herrick mentions it in one of his songs

 come bring with a noise
 my metric merrie boys
 the christmas log to the firing
 while my good dame she
 bids ye all be free
 and drink to your hearts desiring

the yule-clog is still burnt in many farm-houses and kitchens in
england particularly in the north and there are several superstitions
connected with it among the peasantry if a squinting person come to the
house while it is burning or a person barefooted it is considered an
ill omen the brand remaining from the yule-clog is carefully put away
to light the next year's christmas fire


it was really delightful to see the old squire seated in his hereditary
elbow-chair by the hospitable fireside of his ancestors and looking
around him like the sun of a system beaming warmth and gladness to
every heart even the very dog that lay stretched at his feet as he
lazily shifted his position and yawned would look fondly up in his
master's face wag his tail against the floor and stretch himself again
to sleep confident of kindness and protection there is an emanation
from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is
immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease i had not
been seated many minutes by the comfortable hearth of the worthy old
cavalier before i found myself as much at home as if i had been one of
the family

supper was announced shortly after our arrival it was served up in a
spacious oaken chamber the panels of which shone with wax and around
which were several family portraits decorated with holly and ivy
besides the accustomed lights two great wax tapers called christmas
candles wreathed with greens were placed on a highly polished beaufet
among the family plate the table was abundantly spread with substantial
fare but the squire made his supper of frumenty a dish made of wheat
cakes boiled in milk with rich spices being a standing dish in old
times for christmas eve i was happy to find my old friend minced pie
in the retinue of the feast and finding him to be perfectly orthodox
and that i need not be ashamed of my predilection i greeted him with
all the warmth wherewith we usually greet an old and very genteel
acquaintance

the mirth of the company was greatly promoted by the humors of an
eccentric personage whom mr bracebridge always addressed with the
quaint appellation of master simon he was a tight brisk little man
with the air of an arrant old bachelor his nose was shaped like the
bill of a parrot his face slightly pitted with the small-pox with a
dry perpetual bloom on it like a frostbitten leaf in autumn he had an
eye of great quickness and vivacity with a drollery and lurking waggery
of expression that was irresistible he was evidently the wit of the
family dealing very much in sly jokes and innuendoes with the ladies
and making infinite merriment by harping upon old themes which
unfortunately my ignorance of the family chronicles did not permit
me to enjoy it seemed to be his great delight during supper to keep
a young girl next to him in a continual agony of stifled laughter in
spite of her awe of the reproving looks of her mother who sat opposite
indeed he was the idol of the younger part of the company who laughed
at everything he said or did and at every turn of his countenance
i could not wonder at it for he must have been a miracle of
accomplishments in their eyes he could imitate punch and judy make
an old woman of his hand with the assistance of a burnt cork and
pocket-handkerchief and cut an orange into such a ludicrous caricature
that the young folks were ready to die with laughing

i was let briefly into his history by frank bracebridge he was an old
bachelor of a small independent income which by careful management was
sufficient for all his wants he revolved through the family system
like a vagrant comet in its orbit sometimes visiting one branch and
sometimes another quite remote as is often the case with gentlemen of
extensive connections and small fortunes in england he had a chirping
buoyant disposition always enjoying the present moment and his
frequent change of scene and company prevented his acquiring those
rusty unaccommodating habits with which old bachelors are so
uncharitably charged he was a complete family chronicle being versed
in the genealogy history and intermarriages of the whole house of
bracebridge which made him a great favorite with the old folks he was
a beau of all the elder ladies and superannuated spinsters among whom
he was habitually considered rather a young fellow and he was master
of the revels among the children so that there was not a more popular
being in the sphere in which he moved than mr simon bracebridge of
late years he had resided almost entirely with the squire to whom he
had become a factotum and whom he particularly delighted by jumping
with his humor in respect to old times and by having a scrap of an
old song to suit every occasion we had presently a specimen of his
last-mentioned talent for no sooner was supper removed and spiced wines
and other beverages peculiar to the season introduced than master simon
was called on for a good old christmas song he bethought himself for a
moment and then with a sparkle of the eye and a voice that was by no
means bad excepting that it ran occasionally into a falsetto like the
notes of a split reed he quavered forth a quaint old ditty

 now christmas is come
 let us beat up the drum
 and call all our neighbors together
 and when they appear
 let us make them such cheer
 as will keep out the wind and the weather c

the supper had disposed every one to gayety and an old harper was
summoned from the servants hall where he had been strumming all the
evening and to all appearance comforting himself with some of the
squire's home-brewed he was a kind of hanger-on i was told of the
establishment and though ostensibly a resident of the village was
oftener to be found in the squire's kitchen than his own home the old
gentleman being fond of the sound of harp in hall

the dance like most dances after supper was a merry one some of the
older folks joined in it and the squire himself figured down several
couple with a partner with whom he affirmed he had danced at every
christmas for nearly half a century master simon who seemed to be a
kind of connecting link between the old times and the new and to
be withal a little antiquated in the taste of his accomplishments
evidently piqued himself on his dancing and was endeavoring to gain
credit by the heel and toe rigadoon and other graces of the ancient
school but he had unluckily assorted himself with a little romping girl
from boarding-school who by her wild vivacity kept him continually on
the stretch and defeated all his sober attempts at elegance such are
the ill-sorted matches to which antique gentlemen are unfortunately
prone

the young oxonian on the contrary had led out one of his maiden aunts
on whom the rogue played a thousand little knaveries with impunity he
was full of practical jokes and his delight was to tease his aunts and
cousins yet like all madcap youngsters he was a universal favorite
among the women the most interesting couple in the dance was the
young officer and a ward of the squire's a beautiful blushing girl of
seventeen from several shy glances which i had noticed in the course of
the evening i suspected there was a little kindness growing up between
them and indeed the young soldier was just the hero to captivate a
romantic girl he was tall slender and handsome and like most
young british officers of late years had picked up various small
accomplishments on the continent he could talk french and italian draw
landscapes sing very tolerably dance divinely but above all he had
been wounded at waterloo what girl of seventeen well read in poetry
and romance could resist such a mirror of chivalry and perfection

the moment the dance was over he caught up a guitar and lolling
against the old marble fireplace in an attitude which i am half inclined
to suspect was studied began the little french air of the troubadour
the squire however exclaimed against having anything on christmas eve
but good old english upon which the young minstrel casting up his eye
for a moment as if in an effort of memory struck into another strain
and with a charming air of gallantry gave herrick's night-piece to
julia

 her eyes the glow-worm lend thee
 the shooting stars attend thee
 and the elves also
 whose little eyes glow
 like the sparks of fire befriend thee

 no will-o-the-wisp mislight thee
 nor snake nor slow-worm bite thee
 but on thy way
 not making a stay
 since ghost there is none to affright thee

 then let not the dark thee cumber
 what though the moon does slumber
 the stars of the night
 will lend thee their light
 like tapers clear without number

 then julia let me woo thee
 thus thus to come unto me
 and when i shall meet
 thy silvery feet
 my soul i'll pour into thee

the song might or might not have been intended in compliment to the
fair julia for so i found his partner was called she however was
certainly unconscious of any such application for she never looked
at the singer but kept her eyes cast upon the floor her face was
suffused it is true with a beautiful blush and there was a gentle
heaving of the bosom but all that was doubtless caused by the exercise
of the dance indeed so great was her indifference that she amused
herself with plucking to pieces a choice bouquet of hot-house flowers
and by the time the song was concluded the nosegay lay in ruins on the
floor

the party now broke up for the night with the kind-hearted old custom of
shaking hands as i passed through the hall on my way to my chamber the
dying embers of the yule-clog still sent forth a dusky glow and had it
not been the season when no spirit dares stir abroad i should have
been half tempted to steal from my room at midnight and peep whether the
fairies might not be at their revels about the hearth

my chamber was in the old part of the mansion the ponderous furniture
of which might have been fabricated in the days of the giants the room
was panelled with cornices of heavy carved work in which flowers and
grotesque faces were strangely intermingled and a row of black-looking
portraits stared mournfully at me from the walls the bed was of rich
though faded damask with a lofty tester and stood in a niche opposite
a bow window i had scarcely got into bed when a strain of music seemed
to break forth in the air just below the window i listened and found
it proceeded from a band which i concluded to be the waits from some
neighboring village they went round the house playing under the
windows i drew aside the curtains to hear them more distinctly
the moonbeams fell through the upper part of the casement partially
lighting up the antiquated apartment the sounds as they receded
became more soft and aerial and seemed to accord with the quiet and
moonlight i listened and listened they became more and more tender and
remote and as they gradually died away my head sunk upon the pillow
and i fell asleep




christmas day

 dark and dull night flie hence away
 and give the honor to this day
 that sees december turn'd to may
 
 why does the chilling winter's morne
 smile like a field beset with corn
 or smell like to a meade new-shorne
 thus on the sudden come and see
 the cause why things thus fragrant be
 herrick

when i woke the next morning it seemed as if all the events of the
preceding evening had been a dream and nothing but the identity of the
ancient chamber convinced me of their reality while i lay musing on my
pillow i heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door
and a whispering consultation presently a choir of small voices chanted
forth an old christmas carol the burden of which was 

 rejoice our saviour he was born
 on christmas day in the morning

i rose softly slipt on my clothes opened the door suddenly and beheld
one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter could
imagine it consisted of a boy and two girls the eldest not more than
six and lovely as seraphs they were going the rounds of the house and
singing at every chamber door but my sudden appearance frightened them
into mute bashfulness they remained for a moment playing on their lips
with their fingers and now and then stealing a shy glance from under
their eyebrows until as if by one impulse they scampered away and as
they turned an angle of the gallery i heard them laughing in triumph at
their escape

everything conspired to produce kind and happy feelings in this
stronghold of old-fashioned hospitality the window of my chamber looked
out upon what in summer would have been a beautiful landscape there was
a sloping lawn a fine stream winding at the foot of it and a tract of
park beyond with noble clumps of trees and herds of deer at a distance
was a neat hamlet with the smoke from the cottage chimneys hanging over
it and a church with its dark spire in strong relief against the clear
cold sky the house was surrounded with evergreens according to the
english custom which would have given almost an appearance of summer
but the morning was extremely frosty the light vapor of the preceding
evening had been precipitated by the cold and covered all the trees and
every blade of grass with its fine crystalizations the rays of a bright
morning sun had a dazzling effect among the glittering foliage a robin
perched upon the top of a mountain-ash that hung its clusters of red
berries just before my window was basking himself in the sunshine
and piping a few querulous notes and a peacock was displaying all
the glories of his train and strutting with the pride and gravity of a
spanish grandee on the terrace walk below

i had scarcely dressed myself when a servant appeared to invite me to
family prayers he showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing
of the house where i found the principal part of the family already
assembled in a kind of gallery furnished with cushions hassocks and
large prayer-books the servants were seated on benches below the old
gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery and master
simon acted as clerk and made the responses and i must do him the
justice to say that he acquitted himself with great gravity and decorum

the service was followed by a christmas carol which mr bracebridge
himself had constructed from a poem of his favorite author herrick and
it had been adapted to an old church melody by master simon as there
were several good voices among the household the effect was extremely
pleasing but i was particularly gratified by the exaltation of heart
and sudden sally of grateful feeling with which the worthy squire
delivered one stanza his eye glistening and his voice rambling out of
all the bounds of time and tune

 tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth
 with guiltless mirth
 and givest me wassaile bowles to drink
 spiced to the brink
 lord tis thy plenty-dropping hand
 that soiles my land
 and giv'st me for my bushell sowne
 twice ten for one

i afterwards understood that early morning service was read on every
sunday and saint's day throughout the year either by mr bracebridge or
by some member of the family it was once almost universally the case
at the seats of the nobility and gentry of england and it is much to
be regretted that the custom is falling into neglect for the dullest
observer must be sensible of the order and serenity prevalent in those
households where the occasional exercise of a beautiful form of worship
in the morning gives as it were the keynote to every temper for the
day and attunes every spirit to harmony

our breakfast consisted of what the squire denominated true old english
fare he indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts
of tea and toast which he censured as among the causes of modern
effeminacy and weak nerves and the decline of old english heartiness
and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his
guests yet there was a brave display of cold meats wine and ale on
the sideboard

after breakfast i walked about the grounds with frank bracebridge
and master simon or mr simon as he was called by everybody but the
squire we were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs that seemed
loungers about the establishment from the frisking spaniel to the
steady old stag-hound the last of which was of a race that had been
in the family time out of mind they were all obedient to a dog-whistle
which hung to master simon's buttonhole and in the midst of their
gambols would glance an eye occasionally upon a small switch he carried
in his hand

the old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine
than by pale moonlight and i could not but feel the force of the
squire's idea that the formal terraces heavily moulded balustrades and
clipped yew trees carried with them an air of proud aristocracy there
appeared to be an unusual number of peacocks about the place and i was
making some remarks upon what i termed a flock of them that were basking
under a sunny wall when i was gently corrected in my phraseology
by master simon who told me that according to the most ancient and
approved treatise on hunting i must say a muster of peacocks in the
same way added he with a slight air of pedantry we say a flight
of doves or swallows a bevy of quails a herd of deer of wrens or
cranes a skulk of foxes or a building of rooks he went on to inform
me that according to sir anthony fitzherbert we ought to ascribe to
this bird both understanding and glory for being praised he will
presently set up his tail chiefly against the sun to the intent you
may the better behold the beauty thereof but at the fall of the leaf
when his tail falleth he will mourn and hide himself in corners till
his tail come again as it was

i could not help smiling at this display of small erudition on so
whimsical a subject but i found that the peacocks were birds of some
consequence at the hall for frank bracebridge informed me that they
were great favorites with his father who was extremely careful to keep
up the breed partly because they belonged to chivalry and were in
great request at the stately banquets of the olden time and partly
because they had a pomp and magnificence about them highly becoming an
old family mansion nothing he was accustomed to say had an air of
greater state and dignity than a peacock perched upon an antique stone
balustrade

master simon had now to hurry off having an appointment at the parish
church with the village choristers who were to perform some music of
his selection there was something extremely agreeable in the cheerful
flow of animal spirits of the little man and i confess i had been
somewhat surprised at his apt quotations from authors who certainly
were not in the range of every-day reading i mentioned this last
circumstance to frank bracebridge who told me with a smile that master
simon's whole stock of erudition was confined to some half a dozen old
authors which the squire had put into his hands and which he read over
and over whenever he had a studious fit as he sometimes had on a
rainy day or a long winter evening sir anthony fitzherbert's book of
husbandry markham's country contentments the tretyse of hunting by
sir thomas cockayne knight isaac walton's angler and two or three
more such ancient worthies of the pen were his standard authorities
and like all men who know but a few books he looked up to them with a
kind of idolatry and quoted them on all occasions as to his songs
they were chiefly picked out of old books in the squire's library and
adapted to tunes that were popular among the choice spirits of the last
century his practical application of scraps of literature however had
caused him to be looked upon as a prodigy of book-knowledge by all the
grooms huntsmen and small sportsmen of the neighborhood

while we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell
and i was told that the squire was a little particular in having his
household at church on a christmas morning considering it a day of
pouring out of thanks and rejoicing for as old tusser observed 

 at christmas be merry and thankful withal
 and feast thy poor neighbors the great with the small

if you are disposed to go to church said frank bracebridge i can
promise you a specimen of my cousin simon's musical achievements as the
church is destitute of an organ he has formed a band from the village
amateurs and established a musical club for their improvement he has
also sorted a choir as he sorted my father's pack of hounds according
to the directions of jervaise markham in his country contentments for
the bass he has sought out all the deep solemn mouths and for the
tenor the loud-ringing mouths among the country bumpkins and for
sweet-mouths he has culled-with curious taste among the prettiest
lasses in the neighborhood though these last he affirms are the most
difficult to keep in tune your pretty female singer being exceedingly
wayward and capricious and very liable to accident

as the morning though frosty was remarkably fine and clear the most
of the family walked to the church which was a very old building of
gray stone and stood near a village about half a mile from the park
gate adjoining it was a low snug parsonage which seemed coeval with the
church the front of it was perfectly matted with a yew tree that had
been trained against its walls through the dense foliage of which
apertures had been formed to admit light into the small antique
lattices as we passed this sheltered nest the parson issued forth and
preceded us

i had expected to see a sleek well-conditioned pastor such as is often
found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patron's table but i
was disappointed the parson was a little meagre black-looking man
with a grizzled wig that was too wide and stood off from each ear so
that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it like a dried filbert
in its shell he wore a rusty coat with great skirts and pockets that
would have held the church bible and prayer-book and his small legs
seemed still smaller from being planted in large shoes decorated with
enormous buckles

i was informed by frank bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of
his father's at oxford and had received this living shortly after the
latter had come to his estate he was a complete black-letter hunter
and would scarcely read a work printed in the roman character the
editions of caxton and wynkyn de worde were his delight and he was
indefatigable in his researches after such old english writers as have
fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness in deference perhaps to
the notions of mr bracebridge he had made diligent investigations into
the festive rites and holiday customs of former times and had been as
zealous in the inquiry as if he had been a boon companion but it was
merely with that plodding spirit with which men of adust temperament
follow up any track of study merely because it is denominated learning
indifferent to its intrinsic nature whether it be the illustration of
the wisdom or of the ribaldry and obscenity of antiquity he had pored
over these old volumes so intensely that they seemed to have been
reflected into his countenance which if the face be indeed an index of
the mind might be compared to a title-page of black-letter

on reaching the church-porch we found the parson rebuking the
gray-headed sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which
the church was decorated it was he observed an unholy plant profaned
by having been used by the druids in their mystic ceremonies and
though it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of
halls and kitchens yet it had been deemed by the fathers of the church
as unhallowed and totally unfit for sacred purposes so tenacious was
he on this point that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great
part of the humble trophies of his taste before the parson would consent
to enter upon the service of the day

the interior of the church was venerable but simple on the walls were
several mural monuments of the bracebridges and just beside the altar
was a tomb of ancient workmanship on which lay the effigy of a warrior
in armor with his legs crossed a sign of his having been a crusader i
was told it was one of the family who had signalized himself in the holy
land and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the hall

during service master simon stood up in the pew and repeated the
responses very audibly evincing that kind of ceremonious devotion
punctually observed by a gentleman of the old school and a man of old
family connections i observed too that he turned over the leaves of a
folio prayer-book with something of a flourish possibly to show off an
enormous seal-ring which enriched one of his fingers and which had the
look of a family relic but he was evidently most solicitous about
the musical part of the service keeping his eye fixed intently on the
choir and beating time with much gesticulation and emphasis

the orchestra was in a small gallery and presented a most whimsical
grouping of heads piled one above the other among which i particularly
noticed that of the village tailor a pale fellow with a retreating
forehead and chin who played on the clarinet and seemed to have blown
his face to a point and there was another a short pursy man stooping
and laboring at a bass-viol so as to show nothing but the top of a
round bald head like the egg of an ostrich there were two or three
pretty faces among the female singers to which the keen air of a frosty
morning had given a bright rosy tint but the gentlemen choristers had
evidently been chosen like old cremona fiddles more for tone than
looks and as several had to sing from the same book there were
clusterings of odd physiognomies not unlike those groups of cherubs we
sometimes see on country tombstones

the usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well the vocal
parts generally lagging a little behind the instrumental and some
loitering fiddler now and then making up for lost time by travelling
over a passage with prodigious celerity and clearing more bars than the
keenest fox-hunter to be in at the death but the great trial was an
anthem that had been prepared and arranged by master simon and on which
he had founded great expectation unluckily there was a blunder at the
very outset the musicians became flurried master simon was in a fever
everything went on lamely and irregularly until they came to a chorus
beginning now let us sing with one accord which seemed to be a
signal for parting company all became discord and confusion each
shifted for himself and got to the end as well or rather as soon as
he could excepting one old chorister in a pair of horn spectacles
bestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose who happened to stand
a little apart and being wrapped up in his own melody kept on a
quavering course wriggling his head ogling his book and winding all
up by a nasal solo of at least three bars duration

the parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies
of christmas and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day
of thanksgiving but of rejoicing supporting the correctness of his
opinions by the earliest usages of the church and enforcing them by the
authorities of theophilus of caesarea st cyprian st chrysostom st
augustine and a cloud more of saints and fathers from whom he made
copious quotations i was a little at a loss to perceive the necessity
of such a mighty array of forces to maintain a point which no one
present seemed inclined to dispute but i soon found that the good man
had a legion of ideal adversaries to contend with having in the course
of his researches on the subject of christmas got completely embroiled
in the sectarian controversies of the revolution when the puritans made
such a fierce assault upon the ceremonies of the church and poor old
christmas was driven out of the land by proclamation of parliament
the worthy parson lived but with times past and knew but little of the
present

shut up among worm-eaten tomes in the retirement of his antiquated
little study the pages of old times were to him as the gazettes of the
day while the era of the revolution was mere modern history he forgot
that nearly two centuries had elapsed since the fiery persecution of
poor mince-pie throughout the land when plum porridge was denounced as
mere popery and roast beef as anti-christian and that christmas had
been brought in again triumphantly with the merry court of king charles
at the restoration he kindled into warmth with the ardor of his contest
and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to combat he had a
stubborn conflict with old prynne and two or three other forgotten
champions of the roundheads on the subject of christmas festivity
and concluded by urging his hearers in the most solemn and affecting
manner to stand to the traditional customs of their fathers and feast
and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the church


 from the flying eagle a small gazette published
 december the house spent much time this day about
 the business of the navy for settling the affairs at sea
 and before they rose were presented with a terrible
 remonstrance against christmas day grounded upon divine
 scriptures cor v i cor xv and in honor of
 the lord's day grounded upon these scriptures john xx i
 rev i psalms cxviii lev xxiii mark xv
 psalms lxxxiv in which christmas is called anti-
 christ's masse and those masse-mongers and papists who
 observe it etc in consequence of which parliament spent
 some time in consultation about the abolition of christmas
 day passed orders to that effect and resolved to sit on
 the following day which was commonly called christmas day


i have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate
effects for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and
all possessed with the gayety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their
pastor the elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard greeting
and shaking hands and the children ran about crying ule ule and
repeating some uncouth rhymes which the parson who had joined us
informed me had been handed down from days of yore the villagers doffed
their hats to the squire as he passed giving him the good wishes of the
season with every appearance of heartfelt sincerity and were invited by
him to the hall to take something to keep out the cold of the weather
and i heard blessings uttered by several of the poor which convinced
me that in the midst of his enjoyments the worthy old cavalier had not
forgotten the true christmas virtue of charity


 ule ule
 three puddings in a pule
 crack nuts and cry ule


on our way homeward his heart seemed overflowed with generous and happy
feelings as we passed over a rising ground which commanded something
of a prospect the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our
ears the squire paused for a few moments and looked around with an
air of inexpressible benignity the beauty of the day was of itself
sufficient to inspire philanthropy notwithstanding the frostiness of
the morning the sun in his cloudless journey had acquired sufficient
power to melt away the thin covering of snow from every southern
declivity and to bring out the living green which adorns an english
landscape even in mid-winter large tracts of smiling verdure contrasted
with the dazzling whiteness of the shaded slopes and hollows every
sheltered bank on which the broad rays rested yielded its silver rill of
cold and limpid water glittering through the dripping grass and sent
up slight exhalations to contribute to the thin haze that hung just
above the surface of the earth there was something truly cheering in
this triumph of warmth and verdure over the frosty thraldom of winter
it was as the squire observed an emblem of christmas hospitality
breaking through the chills of ceremony and selfishness and thawing
every heart into a flow he pointed with pleasure to the indications of
good cheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farm-houses and
low thatched cottages i love said he to see this day well kept
by rich and poor it is a great thing to have one day in the year
at least when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go and of
having as it were the world all thrown open to you and i am almost
disposed to join with poor robin in his malediction on every churlish
enemy to this honest festival

 those who at christmas do repine
 and would fain hence dispatch him
 may they with old duke humphry dine
 or else may squire ketch catch'em

the squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and
amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower
orders and countenanced by the higher when the old halls of castles and
manor-houses were thrown open at daylight when the tables were covered
with brawn and beef and humming ale when the harp and the carol
resounded all day long and when rich and poor were alike welcome to
enter and make merry our old games and local customs said he had
a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home and the promotion
of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord they made the times
merrier and kinder and better and i can truly say with one of our old
poets

 i like them well the curious preciseness
 and all-pretended gravity of those
 that seek to banish hence these harmless sports
 have thrust away much ancient honesty

the nation continued he is altered we have almost lost our
simple true-hearted peasantry they have broken asunder from the higher
classes and seem to think their interests are separate they have
become too knowing and begin to read newspapers listen to ale-house
politicians and talk of reform i think one mode to keep them in
good-humor in these hard times would be for the nobility and gentry to
pass more time on their estates mingle more among the country-people
and set the merry old english games going again


 an english gentleman at the opening of the great day 
 ie on christmas day in the morning had all his tenants
 and neighbors enter his hall by daybreak the strong beer
 was broached and the black-jacks went plentifully about
 with toast sugar and nutmeg and good cheshire cheese the
 hackin the great sausage must be boiled by daybreak or
 else two young men must take the maiden ie the cook by
 the arms and run her round the market-place till she is
 shamed of her laziness round about our sea-coal fire


such was the good squire's project for mitigating public discontent
and indeed he had once attempted to put his doctrine in practice and
a few years before had kept open house during the holidays in the old
style the country-people however did not understand how to play their
parts in the scene of hospitality many uncouth circumstances occurred
the manor was overrun by all the vagrants of the country and more
beggars drawn into the neighborhood in one week than the parish officers
could get rid of in a year since then he had contented himself with
inviting the decent part of the neighboring peasantry to call at the
hall on christmas day and with distributing beef and bread and ale
among the poor that they might make merry in their own dwellings

we had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a
distance a band of country lads without coats their shirt-sleeves
fancifully tied with ribbons their hats decorated with greens and
clubs in their hands was seen advancing up the avenue followed by a
large number of villagers and peasantry they stopped before the hall
door where the music struck up a peculiar air and the lads performed
a curious and intricate dance advancing retreating and striking their
clubs together keeping exact time to the music while one whimsically
crowned with a fox's skin the tail of which flaunted down his back
kept capering round the skirts of the dance and rattling a christmas box
with many antic gesticulations

the squire eyed this fanciful exhibition with great interest and
delight and gave me a full account of its origin which he traced to
the times when the romans held possession of the island plainly proving
that this was a lineal descendant of the sword dance of the ancients
it was now he said nearly extinct but he had accidentally met
with traces of it in the neighborhood and had encouraged its revival
though to tell the truth it was too apt to be followed up by the rough
cudgel play and broken heads in the evening

after the dance was concluded the whole party was entertained with brawn
and beef and stout home-brewed the squire himself mingled among the
rustics and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference and
regard it is true i perceived two or three of the younger peasants as
they were raising their tankards to their mouths when the squire's
back was turned making something of a grimace and giving each other the
wink but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces and were
exceedingly demure with master simon however they all seemed more
at their ease his varied occupations and amusements had made him well
known throughout the neighborhood he was a visitor at every farmhouse
and cottage gossiped with the farmers and their wives romped with
their daughters and like that type of a vagrant bachelor the
humblebee tolled the sweets from all the rosy lips of the country
round

the bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and
affability there is something genuine and affectionate in the gayety
of the lower orders when it is excited by the bounty and familiarity of
those above them the warm glow of gratitude enters into their mirth
and a kind word or a small pleasantry frankly uttered by a patron
gladdens the heart of the dependant more than oil and wine when the
squire had retired the merriment increased and there was much joking
and laughter particularly between master simon and a hale ruddy-faced
white-headed farmer who appeared to be the wit of the village for i
observed all his companions to wait with open months for his retorts
and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they could well understand
them

the whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment as i passed to my
room to dress for dinner i heard the sound of music in a small court
and looking through a window that commanded it i perceived a band
of wandering musicians with pandean pipes and tambourine a pretty
coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad while
several of the other servants were looking on in the midst of her sport
the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window and coloring up
ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion




the christmas dinner

 lo now is come our joyful'st feast
 let every man be jolly
 eache roome with yvie leaves is drest
 and every post with holly
 now all our neighbours chimneys smoke
 and christmas blocks are burning
 their ovens they with bak't meats choke
 and all their spits are turning
 without the door let sorrow lie
 and if for cold it hap to die
 wee'l bury t in a christmas pye
 and evermore be merry
 withers juvenilia

i had finished my toilet and was loitering with frank bracebridge in
the library when we heard a distant thwacking sound which he informed
me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner the squire kept up old
customs in kitchen as well as hall and the rolling-pin struck upon the
dresser by the cook summoned the servants to carry in the meats

 just in this nick the cook knock'd thrice
 and all the waiters in a trice
 his summons did obey
 each serving-man with dish in hand
 march'd boldly up like our train-band
 presented and away


 sir john suckling


the dinner was served up in the great hall where the squire always held
his christmas banquet a blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped
on to warm the spacious apartment and the flame went sparkling and
wreathing up the wide-mouthed chimney the great picture of the crusader
and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the
occasion and holly and ivy had like-wise been wreathed round the helmet
and weapons on the opposite wall which i understood were the arms of
the same warrior i must own by the by i had strong doubts about
the authenticity of the painting and armor as having belonged to the
crusader they certainly having the stamp of more recent days but i was
told that the painting had been so considered time out of mind and that
as to the armor it had been found in a lumber-room and elevated to its
present situation by the squire who at once determined it to be the
armor of the family hero and as he was absolute authority on all
such subjects in his own household the matter had passed into current
acceptation a sideboard was set out just under this chivalric trophy
on which was a display of plate that might have vied at least in
variety with belshazzar's parade of the vessels of the temple
flagons cans cups beakers goblets basins and ewers the gorgeous
utensils of good companionship that had gradually accumulated through
many generations of jovial housekeepers before these stood the two yule
candles beaming like two stars of the first magnitude other lights
were distributed in branches and the whole array glittered like a
firmament of silver

we were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy
the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace and
twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody never
did christmas board display a more goodly and gracious assemblage of
countenances those who were not handsome were at least happy and
happiness is a rare improver of your hard-favored visage i always
consider an old english family as well worth studying as a collection of
holbein's portraits or albert durer's prints there is much antiquarian
lore to be acquired much knowledge of the physiognomies of former
times perhaps it may be from having continually before their eyes those
rows of old family portraits with which the mansions of this country
are stocked certain it is that the quaint features of antiquity are
often most faithfully perpetuated in these ancient lines and i have
traced an old family nose through a whole picture-gallery legitimately
handed down from generation to generation almost from the time of the
conquest something of the kind was to be observed in the worthy company
around me many of their faces had evidently originated in a gothic
age and been merely copied by succeeding generations and there was one
little girl in particular of staid demeanor with a high roman nose
and an antique vinegar aspect who was a great favorite of the squire's
being as he said a bracebridge all over and the very counterpart of
one of his ancestors who figured in the court of henry viii

the parson said grace which was not a short familiar one such as is
commonly addressed to the deity in these unceremonious days but a long
courtly well-worded one of the ancient school there was now a pause
as if something was expected when suddenly the butler entered the hall
with some degree of bustle he was attended by a servant on each side
with a large wax-light and bore a silver dish on which was an enormous
pig's head decorated with rosemary with a lemon in its mouth which was
placed with great formality at the head of the table the moment this
pageant made its appearance the harper struck up a flourish at the
conclusion of which the young oxonian on receiving a hint from the
squire gave with an air of the most comic gravity an old carol the
first verse of which was as follows

 caput apri defero
 reddens laudes domino
 the boar's head in hand bring i
 with garlands gay and rosemary
 i pray you all synge merily
 qui estis in convivio

though prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities from
being apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host yet i confess the
parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me
until i gathered from the conversation of the squire and the parson that
it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boar's head a dish
formerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and
song at great tables on christmas day i like the old custom said the
squire not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself
but because it was observed at the college at oxford at which i was
educated when i hear the old song chanted it brings to mind the time
when i was young and gamesome and the noble old college hall and my
fellow-students loitering about in their black gowns many of whom poor
lads are now in their graves

the parson however whose mind was not haunted by such associations
and who was always more taken up with the text than the sentiment
objected to the oxonian's version of the carol which he affirmed
was different from that sung at college he went on with the dry
perseverance of a commentator to give the college reading accompanied
by sundry annotations addressing himself at first to the company at
large but finding their attention gradually diverted to other talk and
other objects he lowered his tone as his number of auditors diminished
until he concluded his remarks in an under voice to a fat-headed old
gentleman next him who was silently engaged in the discussion of a huge
plateful of turkey


 the old ceremony of serving up the boar's head on
 christmas day is still observed in the hall of queen's
 college oxford i was favored by the parson with a copy of
 the carol as now sung and as it may be acceptable to such
 of my readers as are curious in these grave and learned
 matters i give it entire

 the boar's head in hand bear i
 bedeck'd with bays and rosemary
 and i pray you my masters be merry
 quot estis in convivio
 caput apri defero
 reddens laudes domino

 the boar's head as i understand
 is the rarest dish in all this land
 which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
 let us servire cantico
 caput apri defero etc

 our steward hath provided this
 in honor of the king of bliss
 which on this day to be served is
 in reginensi atrio
 caput apri defero etc etc etc


the table was literally loaded with good cheer and presented an
epitome of country abundance in this season of overflowing larders
a distinguished post was allotted to ancient sirloin as mine host
termed it being as he added the standard of old english hospitality
and a joint of goodly presence and full of expectation there were
several dishes quaintly decorated and which had evidently something
traditional in their embellishments but about which as i did not like
to appear overcurious i asked no questions

i could not however but notice a pie magnificently decorated with
peacock's feathers in imitation of the tail of that bird which
overshadowed a considerable tract of the table this the squire
confessed with some little hesitation was a pheasant pie though a
peacock pie was certainly the most authentical but there had been such
a mortality among the peacocks this season that he could not prevail
upon himself to have one killed


 the peacock was anciently in great demand for stately
 entertainments sometimes it was made into a pie at one end
 of which the head appeared above the crust in all its
 plumage with the beak richly gilt at the other end the
 tail was displayed such pies were served up at the solemn
 banquets of chivalry when knights-errant pledged themselves
 to undertake any perilous enterprise whence came the
 ancient oath used by justice shallow by cock and pie

the peacock was also an important dish for the christmas feast and
massinger in his city madam gives some idea of the extravagance
with which this as well as other dishes was prepared for the gorgeous
revels of the olden times

 men may talk of country christmasses
 their thirty pound butter'd eggs their pies of carps tongues
 their pheasants drench'd with ambergris the carcases of three
 fat wethers bruised for gravy to make sauce for a single peacock


it would be tedious perhaps to my wiser readers who may not have
that foolish fondness for odd and obsolete things to which i am a
little given were i to mention the other makeshifts or this worthy old
humorist by which he was endeavoring to follow up though at humble
distance the quaint customs of antiquity i was pleased however to
see the respect shown to his whims by his children and relatives who
indeed entered readily into the full spirit of them and seemed all
well versed in their parts having doubtless been present at many a
rehearsal i was amused too at the air of profound gravity with which
the butler and other servants executed the duties assigned them however
eccentric they had an old-fashioned look having for the most part
been brought up in the household and grown into keeping with the
antiquated mansion and the humors of its lord and most probably looked
upon all his whimsical regulations as the established laws of honorable
housekeeping

when the cloth was removed the butler brought in a huge silver vessel
of rare and curious workmanship which he placed before the squire
its appearance was hailed with acclamation being the wassail bowl so
renowned in christmas festivity the contents had been prepared by the
squire himself for it was a beverage in the skilful mixture of which
he particularly prided himself alleging that it was too abstruse and
complex for the comprehension of an ordinary servant it was a potation
indeed that might well make the heart of a toper leap within him being
composed of the richest and raciest wines highly spiced and sweetened
with roasted apples bobbing about the surface


 the wassail bowl was sometimes composed of ale instead of
 wine with nutmeg sugar toast ginger and roasted crabs
 in this way the nut-brown beverage is still prepared in some
 old families and round the hearths of substantial farmers at
 christmas it is also called lamb's wool and is celebrated
 by herrick in his twelfth night

 next crowne the bowle full
 with gentle lamb's wool
 add sugar nutmeg and ginger
 with store of ale too
 and thus ye must doe
 to make the wassaile a swinger


the old gentleman's whole countenance beamed with a serene look of
indwelling delight as he stirred this mighty bowl having raised it to
his lips with a hearty wish of a merry christmas to all present he
sent it brimming round the board for every one to follow his example
according to the primitive style pronouncing it the ancient fountain
of good feeling where all hearts met together


 the custom of drinking out of the same cup gave place to
 each having his cup when the steward came to the doore with
 the wassel he was to cry three times wassel wassel
 wassel and then the chappell chaplain was to answer with
 a song archaeologia


there was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of christmas
joviality circulated and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies when it
reached master simon he raised it in both hands and with the air of a
boon companion struck up an old wassail chanson

 the brown bowle
 the merry brown bowle
 as it goes round-about-a
 fill
 still
 let the world say what it will
 and drink your fill all out-a

 the deep canne
 the merry deep canne
 as thou dost freely quaff-a
 sing
 fling
 be as merry as a king
 and sound a lusty laugh-a


 from poor robin's almanack


much of the conversation during dinner turned upon family topics to
which i was a stranger there was however a great deal of rallying of
master simon about some gay widow with whom he was accused of having
a flirtation this attack was commenced by the ladies but it was
continued throughout the dinner by the fat-headed old gentleman next
the parson with the persevering assiduity of a slow hound being one of
those long-winded jokers who though rather dull at starting game are
unrivalled for their talents in hunting it down at every pause in the
general conversation he renewed his bantering in pretty much the same
terms winking hard at me with both eyes whenever he gave master simon
what he considered a home thrust the latter indeed seemed fond of
being teased on the subject as old bachelors are apt to be and he took
occasion to inform me in an undertone that the lady in question was a
prodigiously fine woman and drove her own curricle

the dinner-time passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity and
though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene
of broader rout and revel yet i doubt whether it ever witnessed more
honest and genuine enjoyment how easy it is for one benevolent being to
diffuse pleasure around him and how truly is a kind heart a fountain of
gladness making everything in its vicinity to freshen into smiles the
joyous disposition of the worthy squire was perfectly contagious he was
happy himself and disposed to make all the world happy and the little
eccentricities of his humor did but season in a manner the sweetness
of his philanthropy

when the ladies had retired the conversation as usual became still
more animated many good things were broached which had been thought
of during dinner but which would not exactly do for a lady's ear and
though i cannot positively affirm that there was much wit uttered yet
i have certainly heard many contests of rare wit produce much less
laughter wit after all is a mighty tart pungent ingredient and much
too acid for some stomachs but honest good-humor is the oil and wine
of a merry meeting and there is no jovial companionship equal to that
where the jokes are rather small and the laughter abundant

the squire told several long stories of early college pranks and
adventures in some of which the parson had been a sharer though in
looking at the latter it required some effort of imagination to figure
such a little dark anatomy of a man into the perpetrator of a madcap
gambol indeed the two college chums presented pictures of what men
may be made by their different lots in life the squire had left the
university to live lustily on his paternal domains in the vigorous
enjoyment of prosperity and sunshine and had flourished on to a hearty
and florid old age whilst the poor parson on the contrary had dried
and withered away among dusty tomes in the silence and shadows of his
study still there seemed to be a spark of almost extinguished fire
feebly glimmering in the bottom of his soul and as the squire hinted
at a sly story of the parson and a pretty milkmaid whom they once met
on the banks of the isis the old gentleman made an alphabet of faces
which as far as i could decipher his physiognomy i verily believe was
indicative of laughter indeed i have rarely met with an old gentleman
that took absolute offence at the imputed gallantries of his youth

i found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of
sober judgment the company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew
duller master simon was in as chirping a humor as a grasshopper filled
with dew his old songs grew of a warmer complexion and he began to
talk maudlin about the widow he even gave a long song about the wooing
of a widow which he informed me he had gathered from an excellent
black-letter work entitled cupid's solicitor for love containing store
of good advice for bachelors and which he promised to lend me the
first verse was to effect

 he that will woo a widow must not dally
 he must make hay while the sun doth shine
 he must not stand with her shall i shall i
 but boldly say widow thou must be mine

this song inspired the fat-headed old gentleman who made several
attempts to tell a rather broad story out of joe miller that was pat to
the purpose but he always stuck in the middle everybody recollecting
the latter part excepting himself the parson too began to show the
effects of good cheer having gradually settled down into a doze and his
wig sitting most suspiciously on one side just at this juncture we were
summoned to the drawing room and i suspect at the private instigation
of mine host whose joviality seemed always tempered with a proper love
of decorum

after the dinner-table was removed the hall was given up to the younger
members of the family who prompted to all kind of noisy mirth by the
oxonian and master simon made its old walls ring with their merriment
as they played at romping games i delight in witnessing the gambols of
children and particularly at this happy holiday season and could not
help stealing out of the drawing-room on hearing one of their peals of
laughter i found them at the game of blindman's-buff master simon who
was the leader of their revels and seemed on all occasions to fulfill
the office of that ancient potentate the lord of misrule was blinded
in the midst of the hall the little beings were as busy about him as
the mock fairies about falstaff pinching him plucking at the skirts of
his coat and tickling him with straws one fine blue-eyed girl of about
thirteen with her flaxen hair all in beautiful confusion her frolic
face in a glow her frock half torn off her shoulders a complete
picture of a romp was the chief tormentor and from the slyness with
which master simon avoided the smaller game and hemmed this wild little
nymph in corners and obliged her to jump shrieking over chairs
i suspected the rogue of being not a whit more blinded than was
convenient


 at christmasse there was in the kinges house wheresoever
 hee was lodged a lorde of misrule or mayster of merie
 disportes and the like had ye in the house of every
 nobleman of honor or good worshipper were he spirituall or
 temporall stow


when i returned to the drawing-room i found the company seated round the
fire listening to the parson who was deeply ensconced in a high-backed
oaken chair the work of some cunning artificer of yore which had been
brought from the library for his particular accommodation from this
venerable piece of furniture with which his shadowy figure and dark
weazen face so admirably accorded he was dealing out strange accounts
of the popular superstitions and legends of the surrounding country
with which he had become acquainted in the course of his antiquarian
researches i am half inclined to think that the old gentleman was
himself somewhat tinctured with superstition as men are very apt to
be who live a recluse and studious life in a sequestered part of the
country and pore over black-letter tracts so often filled with the
marvelous and supernatural he gave us several anecdotes of the fancies
of the neighboring peasantry concerning the effigy of the crusader which
lay on the tomb by the church altar as it was the only monument of
the kind in that part of the country it had always been regarded with
feelings of superstition by the good wives of the village it was said
to get up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy
nights particularly when it thundered and one old woman whose cottage
bordered on the churchyard had seen it through the windows of the
church when the moon shone slowly pacing up and down the aisles
it was the belief that some wrong had been left unredressed by the
deceased or some treasure hidden which kept the spirit in a state of
trouble and restlessness some talked of gold and jewels buried in the
tomb over which the spectre kept watch and there was a story current
of a sexton in old times who endeavored to break his way to the coffin
at night but just as he reached it received a violent blow from
the marble hand of the effigy which stretched him senseless on the
pavement these tales were often laughed at by some of the sturdier
among the rustics yet when night came on there were many of the
stoutest unbelievers that were shy of venturing alone in the footpath
that led across the churchyard

from these and other anecdotes that followed the crusader appeared to be
the favorite hero of ghost-stories throughout the vicinity his picture
which hung up in the hall was thought by the servants to have something
supernatural about it for they remarked that in whatever part of the
hall you went the eyes of the warrior were still fixed on you the old
porter's wife too at the lodge who had been born and brought up in
the family and was a great gossip among the maid-servants affirmed
that in her young days she had often heard say that on midsummer eve
when it was well known all kinds of ghosts goblins and fairies become
visible and walk abroad the crusader used to mount his horse come down
from his picture ride about the house down the avenue and so to the
church to visit the tomb on which occasion the church-door most civilly
swung open of itself not that he needed it for he rode through closed
gates and even stone walls and had been seen by one of the dairymaids
to pass between two bars of the great park gate making himself as thin
as a sheet of paper

all these superstitions i found had been very much countenanced by the
squire who though not superstitious himself was very fond of seeing
others so he listened to every goblin tale of the neighboring gossips
with infinite gravity and held the porter's wife in high favor on
account of her talent for the marvellous he was himself a great reader
of old legends and romances and often lamented that he could not
believe in them for a superstitious person he thought must live in a
kind of fairy-land

whilst we were all attention to the parson's stories our ears were
suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall in
which were mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy with the
uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter the door suddenly flew
open and a train came trooping into the room that might almost
have been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of faery that
indefatigable spirit master simon in the faithful discharge of his
duties as lord of misrule had conceived the idea of a christmas mummery
or masking and having called in to his assistance the oxonian and the
young officer who were equally ripe for anything that should occasion
romping and merriment they had carried it into instant effect the old
housekeeper had been consulted the antique clothespresses and wardrobes
rummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had not seen the
light for several generations the younger part of the company had been
privately convened from the parlor and hall and the whole had been
bedizened out into a burlesque imitation of an antique mask


 maskings or mummeries were favorite sports at christmas in
 old times and the wardrobes at halls and manor-houses were
 often laid under contribution to furnish dresses and
 fantastic disguisings i strongly suspect master simon to
 have taken the idea of his from ben jonson's masque of
 christmas


master simon led the van as ancient christmas quaintly apparelled in
a ruff a short cloak which had very much the aspect of one of the old
housekeeper's petticoats and a hat that might have served for a
village steeple and must indubitably have figured in the days of the
covenanters from under this his nose curved boldly forth flushed with
a frost-bitten bloom that seemed the very trophy of a december blast he
was accompanied by the blue-eyed romp dished up as dame mince pie
in the venerable magnificence of a faded brocade long stomacher peaked
hat and high-heeled shoes the young officer appeared as robin hood in
a sporting dress of kendal green and a foraging cap with a gold tassel

the costume to be sure did not bear testimony to deep research and
there was an evident eye to the picturesque natural to a young gallant
in the presence of his mistress the fair julia hung on his arm in a
pretty rustic dress as maid marian the rest of the train had been
metamorphosed in various ways the girls trussed up in the finery of the
ancient belles of the bracebridge line and the striplings bewhiskered
with burnt cork and gravely clad in broad skirts hanging sleeves
and full-bottomed wigs to represent the character of roast beef plum
pudding and other worthies celebrated in ancient maskings the whole
was under the control of the oxonian in the appropriate character of
misrule and i observed that he exercised rather a mischievous sway with
his wand over the smaller personages of the pageant

the irruption of this motley crew with beat of drum according to
ancient custom was the consummation of uproar and merriment master
simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which as
ancient christmas he walked a minuet with the peerless though giggling
dame mince pie it was followed by a dance of all the characters which
from its medley of costumes seemed as though the old family portraits
had skipped down from their frames to join in the sport different
centuries were figuring at cross hands and right and left the dark
ages were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons and the days of queen
bess jigging merrily down the middle through a line of succeeding
generations

the worthy squire contemplated these fantastic sports and this
resurrection of his old wardrobe with the simple relish of childish
delight he stood chuckling and rubbing his hands and scarcely hearing
a word the parson said notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing
most authentically on the ancient and stately dance of the pavon or
peacock from which he conceived the minuet to be derived for my
part i was in a continual excitement from the varied scenes of whim
and innocent gayety passing before me it was inspiring to see wild-eyed
frolic and warm-hearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills
and glooms of winter and old age throwing off his apathy and catching
once more the freshness of youthful enjoyment i felt also an interest
in the scene from the consideration that these fleeting customs were
posting fast into oblivion and that this was perhaps the only family
in england in which the whole of them was still punctiliously observed
there was a quaintness too mingled with all this revelry that gave
it a peculiar zest it was suited to the time and place and as the old
manor-house almost reeled with mirth and wassail it seemed echoing back
the joviality of long departed years


 sir john hawkins speaking of the dance called the pavon
 from pavo a peacock says it is a grave and majestic
 dance the method of dancing it anciently was by gentlemen
 dressed with caps and swords by those of the long robe in
 their gowns by the peers in their mantles and by the
 ladies in gowns with long trains the motion whereof in
 dancing resembled that of a peacock history of music

 at the time of the first publication of this paper the
 picture of an old-fashioned christmas in the country was
 pronounced by some as out of date the author had afterwards
 an opportunity of witnessing almost all the customs above
 described existing in unexpected vigor in the skirts of
 derbyshire and yorkshire where he passed the christmas
 holidays the reader will find some notice of them in the
 author's account of his sojourn at newstead abbey


but enough of christmas and its gambols it is time for me to pause
in this garrulity methinks i hear the questions asked by my graver
readers to what purpose is all this how is the world to be made
wiser by this talk alas is there not wisdom enough extant for the
instruction of the world and if not are there not thousands of abler
pens laboring for its improvement it is so much pleasanter to please
than to instruct to play the companion rather than the preceptor

what after all is the mite of wisdom that i could throw into the mass
of knowledge or how am i sure that my sagest deductions may be safe
guides for the opinions of others but in writing to amuse if i fail
the only evil is in my own disappointment if however i can by any
lucky chance in these days of evil rub out one wrinkle from the brow
of care or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow if i can now
and then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy prompt a
benevolent view of human nature and make my reader more in good-humor
with his fellow-beings and himself surely surely i shall not then
have written entirely in vain




london antiques

 i do walk
 methinks like guide vaux with my dark lanthorn
 stealing to set the town o fire i th country
 i should be taken for william o the wisp
 or robin goodfellow
 fletcher

i am somewhat of an antiquity-hunter and am fond of exploring london in
quest of the relics of old times these are principally to be found in
the depths of the city swallowed up and almost lost in a wilderness of
brick and mortar but deriving poetical and romantic interest from the
commonplace prosaic world around them i was struck with an instance of
the kind in the course of a recent summer ramble into the city for the
city is only to be explored to advantage in summer-time when free from
the smoke and fog and rain and mud of winter i had been buffeting for
some time against the current of population setting through fleet
street the warm weather had unstrung my nerves and made me sensitive to
every jar and jostle and discordant sound the flesh was weary the
spirit faint and i was getting out of humor with the bustling busy
throng through which i had to struggle when in a fit of desperation i
tore my way through the crowd plunged into a by-lane and after
passing through several obscure nooks and angles emerged into a quaint
and quiet court with a grassplot in the centre overhung by elms and
kept perpetually fresh and green by a fountain with its sparkling jet of
water a student with book in hand was seated on a stone bench partly
reading partly meditating on the movements of two or three trim
nursery-maids with their infant charges

i was like an arab who had suddenly come upon an oasis amid the panting
sterility of the desert by degrees the quiet and coolness of the place
soothed my nerves and refreshed my spirit i pursued my walk and came
hard by to a very ancient chapel with a low-browed saxon portal of
massive and rich architecture the interior was circular and lofty and
lighted from above around were monumental tombs of ancient date on
which were extended the marble effigies of warriors in armor some had
the hands devoutly crossed upon the breast others grasped the pommel of
the sword menacing hostility even in the tomb while the crossed legs
of several indicated soldiers of the faith who had been on crusades to
the holy land

i was in fact in the chapel of the knights templars strangely
situated in the very centre of sordid traffic and i do not know a more
impressive lesson for the many of the world than thus suddenly to turn
aside from the highway of busy money-seeking life and sit down
among these shadowy sepulchres where all is twilight dust and
forget-fullness

in a subsequent tour of observation i encountered another of these
relics of a foregone world locked up in the heart of the city i had
been wandering for some time through dull monotonous streets destitute
of anything to strike the eye or excite the imagination when i beheld
before me a gothic gateway of mouldering antiquity it opened into a
spacious quadrangle forming the courtyard of a stately gothic pile the
portal of which stood invitingly open

it was apparently a public edifice and as i was antiquity-hunting i
ventured in though with dubious steps meeting no one either to oppose
or rebuke my intrusion i continued on until i found myself in a
great hall with a lofty arched roof and oaken gallery all of gothic
architecture at one end of the hall was an enormous fireplace with
wooden settles on each side at the other end was a raised platform
or dais the seat of state above which was the portrait of a man in
antique garb with a long robe a ruff and a venerable gray beard

the whole establishment had an air of monastic quiet and seclusion and
what gave it a mysterious charm was that i had not met with a human
being since i had passed the threshold

encouraged by this loneliness i seated myself in a recess of a large
bow window which admitted a broad flood of yellow sunshine checkered
here and there by tints from panes of colored glass while an open
casement let in the soft summer air here leaning my head on my hand
and my arm on an old oaken table i indulged in a sort of reverie about
what might have been the ancient uses of this edifice it had evidently
been of monastic origin perhaps one of those collegiate establishments
built of yore for the promotion of learning where the patient monk
in the ample solitude of the cloister added page to page and volume to
volume emulating in the productions of his brain the magnitude of the
pile he inhabited

as i was seated in this musing mood a small panelled door in an arch at
the upper end of the hall was opened and a number of gray-headed old
men clad in long black cloaks came forth one by one proceeding in
that manner through the hall without uttering a word each turning a
pale face on me as he passed and disappearing through a door at the
lower end

i was singularly struck with their appearance their black cloaks and
antiquated air comported with the style of this most venerable and
mysterious pile it was as if the ghosts of the departed years about
which i had been musing were passing in review before me pleasing
myself with such fancies i set out in the spirit of romance to
explore what i pictured to myself a realm of shadows existing in the
very centre of substantial realities

my ramble led me through a labyrinth of interior courts and corridors
and dilapidated cloisters for the main edifice had many additions and
dependencies built at various times and in various styles in one open
space a number of boys who evidently belonged to the establishment
were at their sports but everywhere i observed those mysterious
old gray men in black mantles sometimes sauntering alone sometimes
conversing in groups they appeared to be the pervading genii of the
place i now called to mind what i had read of certain colleges in
old times where judicial astrology geomancy necromancy and other
forbidden and magical sciences were taught was this an establishment of
the kind and were these black-cloaked old men really professors of the
black art

these surmises were passing through my mind as my eye glanced into
a chamber hung round with all kinds of strange and uncouth
objects implements of savage warfare strange idols and stuffed
alligators bottled serpents and monsters decorated the mantelpiece
while on the high tester of an old-fashioned bedstead grinned a human
skull flanked on each side by a dried cat

i approached to regard more narrowly this mystic chamber which seemed a
fitting laboratory for a necromancer when i was startled at beholding
a human countenance staring at me from a dusky corner it was that of a
small shrivelled old man with thin cheeks bright eyes and gray wiry
projecting eyebrows i at first doubted whether it were not a mummy
curiously preserved but it moved and i saw that it was alive it was
another of these black-cloaked old men and as i regarded his quaint
physiognomy his obsolete garb and the hideous and sinister objects by
which he was surrounded i began to persuade myself that i had come upon
the arch-mage who ruled over this magical fraternity

seeing me pausing before the door he rose and invited me to enter i
obeyed with singular hardihood for how did i know whether a wave of his
wand might not metamorphose me into some strange monster or conjure me
into one of the bottles on his mantelpiece he proved however to be
anything but a conjurer and his simple garrulity soon dispelled all the
magic and mystery with which i had enveloped this antiquated pile and
its no less antiquated inhabitants

it appeared that i had made my way into the centre of an ancient asylum
for superannuated tradesmen and decayed householders with which was
connected a school for a limited number of boys it was founded upwards
of two centuries since on an old monastic establishment and retained
somewhat of the conventual air and character the shadowy line of old
men in black mantles who had passed before me in the hall and whom i
had elevated into magi turned out to be the pensioners returning from
morning service in the chapel

john hallum the little collector of curiosities whom i had made the
arch magician had been for six years a resident of the place and
had decorated this final nestling-place of his old age with relics
and rarities picked up in the course of his life according to his
own account he had been somewhat of a traveller having been once in
france and very near making a visit to holland he regretted not having
visited the latter country as then he might have said he had been
there he was evidently a traveller of the simple kind

he was aristocratical too in his notions keeping aloof as i found
from the ordinary run of pensioners his chief associates were a blind
man who spoke latin and greek of both which languages hallum was
profoundly ignorant and a broken-down gentleman who had run through
a fortune of forty thousand pounds left him by his father and ten
thousand pounds the marriage portion of his wife little hallum seemed
to consider it an indubitable sign of gentle blood as well as of lofty
spirit to be able to squander such enormous sums

ps the picturesque remnant of old times into which i have thus
beguiled the reader is what is called the charter house originally
the chartreuse it was founded in on the remains of an ancient
convent by sir thomas sutton being one of those noble charities set
on foot by individual munificence and kept up with the quaintness and
sanctity of ancient times amidst the modern changes and innovations
of london here eighty broken-down men who have seen better days
are provided in their old age with food clothing fuel and a yearly
allowance for private expenses they dine together as did the monks of
old in the hall which had been the refectory of the original convent
attached to the establishment is a school for forty-four boys

stow whose work i have consulted on the subject speaking of the
obligations of the gray-headed pensioners says they are not to
intermeddle with any business touching the affairs of the hospital
but to attend only to the service of god and take thankfully what is
provided for them without muttering murmuring or grudging none to
wear weapon long hair colored boots spurs or colored shoes feathers
in their hats or any ruffian-like or unseemly apparel but such as
becomes hospital-men to wear and in truth adds stow happy are
they that are so taken from the cares and sorrows of the world and
fixed in so good a place as these old men are having nothing to care
for but the good of their souls to serve god and to live in brotherly
love

for the amusement of such as have been interested by the preceding
sketch taken down from my own observation and who may wish to know a
little more about the mysteries of london i subjoin a modicum of local
history put into my hands by an odd-looking old gentleman in a small
brown wig and a snuff-colored coat with whom i became acquainted
shortly after my visit to the charter house i confess i was a little
dubious at first whether it was not one of those apocryphal tales often
passed off upon inquiring travellers like myself and which have brought
our general character for veracity into such unmerited reproach on
making proper inquiries however i have received the most satisfactory
assurances of the author's probity and indeed have been told that he
is actually engaged in a full and particular account of the very
interesting region in which he resides of which the following may be
considered merely as a foretaste




little britain

what i write is most true i have a whole booke of cases lying by
me which if i should sette foorth some grave auntients within the
hearing of bow bell would be out of charity with me nash

in the centre of the great city of london lies a small neighborhood
consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts of very venerable
and debilitated houses which goes by the name of little britain christ
church school and st bartholomew's hospital bound it on the west
smithfield and long lane on the north aldersgate street like an arm
of the sea divides it from the eastern part of the city whilst the
yawning gulf of bull-and-mouth street separates it from butcher lane
and the regions of newgate over this little territory thus bounded and
designated the great dome of st paul's swelling above the intervening
houses of paternoster row amen corner and ave-maria lane looks down
with an air of motherly protection

this quarter derives its appellation from having been in ancient times
the residence of the dukes of brittany as london increased however
rank and fashion rolled off to the west and trade creeping on at their
heels took possession of their deserted abodes for some time little
britain became the great mart of learning and was peopled by the busy
and prolific race of booksellers these also gradually deserted it and
emigrating beyond the great strait of newgate street settled down
in paternoster row and st paul's churchyard where they continue to
increase and multiply even at the present day

but though thus fallen into decline little britain still bears traces
of its former splendor there are several houses ready to tumble down
the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings
of hideous faces unknown birds beasts and fishes and fruits and
flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify there are also
in aldersgate street certain remains of what were once spacious and
lordly family mansions but which have in latter days been subdivided
into several tenements here may often be found the family of a petty
tradesman with its trumpery furniture burrowing among the relics of
antiquated finery in great rambling time-stained apartments with fretted
ceilings gilded cornices and enormous marble fireplaces the lanes and
courts also contain many smaller houses not on so grand a scale but
like your small ancient gentry sturdily maintaining their claims to
equal antiquity these have their gable ends to the street great bow
windows with diamond panes set in lead grotesque carvings and low
arched doorways


 it is evident that the author of this interesting
 communication has included in his general title of little
 britain man of those little lanes and courts that belong
 immediately to cloth fair


in this most venerable and sheltered little nest have i passed several
quiet years of existence comfortably lodged in the second floor of
one of the smallest but oldest edifices my sitting-room is an old
wainscoted chamber with small panels and set off with a miscellaneous
array of furniture i have a particular respect for three or four
high-backed claw-footed chairs covered with tarnished brocade which
bear the marks of having seen better days and have doubtless figured
in some of the old palaces of little britain they seem to me to
keep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their
leathern-bottomed neighbors as i have seen decayed gentry carry a
high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to
associate the whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a
bow window on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous
occupants for many generations mingled with scraps of very indifferent
gentleman-like poetry written in characters which i can scarcely
decipher and which extol the charms of many a beauty of little britain
who has long long since bloomed faded and passed away as i am an
idle personage with no apparent occupation and pay my bill regularly
every week i am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of
the neighborhood and being curious to learn the internal state of a
community so apparently shut up within itself i have managed to work my
way into all the concerns and secrets of the place

little britain may truly be called the heart's core of the city the
stronghold of true john bullism it is a fragment of london as it was in
its better days with its antiquated folks and fashions here flourish
in great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore
the inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on shrove tuesday hot
cross-buns on good friday and roast goose at michaelmas they send
love-letters on valentine's day burn the pope on the fifth of november
and kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at christmas roast beef and
plum-pudding are also held in superstitious veneration and port and
sherry maintain their grounds as the only true english wines all others
being considered vile outlandish beverages

little britain has its long catalogue of city wonders which its
inhabitants consider the wonders of the world such as the great bell
of st paul's which sours all the beer when it tolls the figures that
strike the hours at st dunstan's clock the monument the lions in the
tower and the wooden giants in guildhall they still believe in dreams
and fortune-telling and an old woman that lives in bull-and-mouth
street makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods
and promising the girls good husbands they are apt to be rendered
uncomfortable by comets and eclipses and if a dog howls dolefully at
night it is looked upon as a sure sign of death in the place there
are even many ghost-stories current particularly concerning the old
mansion-houses in several of which it is said strange sights are
sometimes seen lords and ladies the former in full-bottomed wigs
hanging sleeves and swords the latter in lappets stays hoops and
brocade have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers
on moonlight nights and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient
proprietors in their court-dresses

little britain has likewise its sages and great men one of the most
important of the former is a tall dry old gentleman of the name
of skryme who keeps a small apothecary's shop he has a cadaverous
countenance full of cavities and projections with a brown circle round
each eye like a pair of horn spectacles he is much thought of by the
old women who consider him as a kind of conjurer because he has two or
three stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop and several snakes in
bottles he is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers and is much
given to pore over alarming accounts of plots conspiracies fires
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions which last phenomena he considers
as signs of the times he has always some dismal tale of the kind to
deal out to his customers with their doses and thus at the same time
puts both soul and body into an uproar he is a great believer in omens
and predictions and has the prophecies of robert nixon and mother
shipton by heart no man can make so much out of an eclipse or even
an unusually dark day and he shook the tail of the last comet over the
heads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly frightened
out of their wits he has lately got hold of a popular legend or
prophecy on which he has been unusually eloquent there has been a
saying current among the ancient sibyls who treasure up these things
that when the grasshopper on the top of the exchange shook hands with
the dragon on the top of bow church steeple fearful events would take
place this strange conjunction it seems has as strangely come to
pass the same architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the
cupola of the exchange and the steeple of bow church and fearful to
relate the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie cheek by jole in
the yard of his workshop

others as mr skryme is accustomed to say may go star-gazing and
look for conjunctions in the heavens but here is a conjunction on the
earth near at home and under our own eyes which surpasses all
the signs and calculations of astrologers since these portentous
weathercocks have thus laid their heads together wonderful events had
already occurred the good old king notwithstanding that he had lived
eighty-two years had all at once given up the ghost another king had
mounted the throne a royal duke had died suddenly another in france
had been murdered there had been radical meetings in all parts of the
kingdom the bloody scenes at manchester the great plot in cato street
and above all the queen had returned to england all these sinister
events are recounted by mr skyrme with a mysterious look and a dismal
shake of the head and being taken with his drugs and associated in the
minds of his auditors with stuffed-sea-monsters bottled serpents and
his own visage which is a title-page of tribulation they have spread
great gloom through the minds of the people of little britain they
shake their heads whenever they go by bow church and observe that they
never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple which in
old times told nothing but glad tidings as the history of whittington
and his cat bears witness

the rival oracle of little britain is a substantial cheesemonger
who lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions and is as
magnificently lodged as a round-bellied mite in the midst of one of his
own cheshires indeed he is a man of no little standing and importance
and his renown extends through huggin lane and lad lane and even unto
aldermanbury his opinion is very much taken in affairs of state having
read the sunday papers for the last half century together with
the gentleman's magazine rapin's history of england and the naval
chronicle his head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne
the test of time and use for centuries it is his firm opinion that
it is a moral impossible so long as england is true to herself that
anything can shake her and he has much to say on the subject of the
national debt which somehow or other he proves to be a great national
bulwark and blessing he passed the greater part of his life in the
purlieus of little britain until of late years when having become
rich and grown into the dignity of a sunday cane he begins to take his
pleasure and see the world he has therefore made several excursions to
hampstead highgate and other neighboring towns where he has passed
whole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a telescope
and endeavoring to descry the steeple of st bartholomew's not a
stage-coachman of bull-and-mouth street but touches his hat as he
passes and he is considered quite a patron at the coach-office of the
goose and gridiron st paul's churchyard his family have been very
urgent for him to make an expedition to margate but he has great doubts
of those new gimcracks the steamboats and indeed thinks himself too
advanced in life to undertake sea-voyages

little britain has occasionally its factions and divisions and party
spirit ran very high at one time in consequence of two rival burial
societies being set up in the place one held its meeting at the swan
and horse-shoe and was patronized by the cheesemonger the other at the
cock and crown under the auspices of the apothecary it is needless to
say that the latter was the most flourishing i have passed an evening
or two at each and have acquired much valuable information as to
the best mode of being buried the comparative merits of churchyards
together with divers hints on the subject of patent iron coffins i have
heard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality
of prohibiting the latter on account of their durability the feuds
occasioned by these societies have happily died of late but they were
for a long time prevailing themes of controversy the people of little
britain being extremely solicitous of funeral honors and of lying
comfortably in their graves

besides these two funeral societies there is a third of quite a
different cast which tends to throw the sunshine of good-humor over the
whole neighborhood it meets once a week at a little old-fashioned
house kept by a jolly publican of the name of wagstaff and bearing for
insignia a resplendent half-moon with a most seductive bunch of grapes
the whole edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the
thirsty wayfarer such as truman hanbury and co's entire wine
rum and brandy vaults old tom rum and compounds etc this indeed
has been a temple of bacchus and momus from time immemorial it has
always been in the family of the wagstaffs so that its history is
tolerably preserved by the present landlord it was much frequented by
the gallants and cavalieros of the reign of elizabeth and was looked
into now and then by the wits of charles the second's day but what
wagstaff principally prides himself upon is that henry the eighth in
one of his nocturnal rambles broke the head of one of his ancestors
with his famous walking-staff this however is considered as rather a
dubious and vain-glorious boast of the landlord

the club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of
the roaring lads of little britain they abound in old catches glees
and choice stories that are traditional in the place and not to be met
with in any other part of the metropolis there is a madcap undertaker
who is inimitable at a merry song but the life of the club and
indeed the prime wit of little britain is bully wagstaff himself his
ancestors were all wags before him and he has inherited with the inn
a large stock of songs and jokes which go with it from generation to
generation as heirlooms he is a dapper little fellow with bandy legs
and pot belly a red face with a moist merry eye and a little shock of
gray hair behind at the opening of every club night he is called in to
sing his confession of faith which is the famous old drinking trowl
from gammer gurton's needle he sings it to be sure with many
variations as he received it from his father's lips for it has been a
standing favorite at the half-moon and bunch of grapes ever since it was
written nay he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor
of singing it before the nobility and gentry at christmas mummeries
when little britain was in all its glory


 as mine host of the half-moon's confession of faith may
 not be familiar to the majority of readers and as it is a
 specimen of the current songs of little britain i subjoin
 it in its original orthography i would observe that the
 whole club always join in the chorus with a fearful thumping
 on the table and clattering of pewter pots

 i cannot eate but lytle meate
 my stomacke is not good
 but sure i thinke that i can drinke
 with him that weares a hood
 though i go bare take ye no care
 i nothing am a colde
 i stuff my skyn so full within
 of joly good ale and olde

 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare
 both foote and hand go colde
 but belly god send thee good ale ynoughe
 whether it be new or olde

 i have no rost but a nut brawne toste
 and a crab laid in the fyre
 a little breade shall do me steade
 much breade i not desyre
 no frost nor snow nor winde i trowe
 can hurte mee if i wolde
 i am so wrapt and throwly lapt
 of joly good ale and olde

 chorus backe and syde go bare go bare etc

 and tyb my wife that as her lyfe
 loveth well good ale to seeke
 full oft drynkes shee tyll ye may see
 the teares run downe her cheeke
 then doth shee trowle to me the bowle

it would do one's heart good to hear on a club night the shouts of
merriment the snatches of song and now and then the choral bursts of
half a dozen discordant voices which issue from this jovial mansion at
such times the street is lined with listeners who enjoy a delight equal
to that of gazing into a confectioner's window or snuffing up the steams
of a cook-shop

there are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in
little britain these are st bartholomew's fair and the lord mayor's
day during the time of the fair which is held in the adjoining regions
of smithfield there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding
about the late quiet streets of little britain are overrun with an
irruption of strange figures and faces every tavern is a scene of rout
and revel the fiddle and the song are heard from the taproom morning
noon and night and at each window may be seen some group of boon
companions with half-shut eyes hats on one side pipe in mouth and
tankard in hand fondling and prosing and singing maudlin songs over
their liquor even the sober decorum of private families which i must
say is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbors is no proof
against this saturnalia there is no such thing as keeping maid-servants
within doors their brains are absolutely set madding with punch and
the puppet-show the flying horses signior polito the fire-eater the
celebrated mr paap and the irish giant the children too lavish all
their holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread and fill the house
with the lilliputian din of drums trumpets and penny whistles

but the lord mayor's day is the great anniversary the lord mayor
is looked up to by the inhabitants of little britain as the greatest
potentate upon earth his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of
human splendor and his procession with all the sheriffs and aldermen
in his train as the grandest of earthly pageants how they exult in
the idea that the king himself dare not enter the city without first
knocking at the gate of temple bar and asking permission of the lord
mayor for if he did heaven and earth there is no knowing what might
be the consequence the man in armor who rides before the lord mayor
and is the city champion has orders to cut down everybody that offends
against the dignity of the city and then there is the little man with a
velvet porringer on his head who sits at the window of the state coach
and holds the city sword as long as a pikestaff odd's blood if he
once draws that sword majesty itself is not safe

under the protection of this mighty potentate therefore the good
people of little britain sleep in peace temple bar is an effectual
barrier against all interior foes and as to foreign invasion the lord
mayor has but to throw himself into the tower call in the train-bands
and put the standing army of beef-eaters under arms and he may bid
defiance to the world

thus wrapped up in its own concerns its own habits and its own
opinions little britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this
great fungous metropolis i have pleased myself with considering it as
a chosen spot where the principles of sturdy john bullism were garnered
up like seed corn to renew the national character when it had run
to waste and degeneracy i have rejoiced also in the general spirit of
harmony that prevailed throughout it for though there might now
and then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the
cheesemonger and the apothecary and an occasional feud between the
burial societies yet these were but transient clouds and soon passed
away the neighbors met with good-will parted with a shake of the hand
and never abused each other except behind their backs

i could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which i
have been present where we played at all-fours pope-joan
tom-come-tickle-me and other choice old games and where we sometimes
had a good old english country dance to the tune of sir roger de
coverley once a year also the neighbors would gather together and go on
a gypsy party to epping forest it would have done any man's heart good
to see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on the grass
under the trees how we made the woods ring with bursts of laughter at
the songs of little wagstaff and the merry undertaker after dinner
too the young folks would play at blindman's-buff and hide-and-seek
and it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers and to hear a
fine romping girl now and then squeak from among the bushes the elder
folks would gather round the cheesemonger and the apothecary to hear
them talk politics for they generally brought out a newspaper in their
pockets to pass away time in the country they would now and then to
be sure get a little warm in argument but their disputes were always
adjusted by reference to a worthy old umbrella-maker in a double chin
who never exactly comprehending the subject managed somehow or other
to decide in favor of both parties

all empires however says some philosopher or historian are doomed to
changes and revolutions luxury and innovation creep in factions arise
and families now and then spring up whose ambition and intrigues
throw the whole system into confusion thus in letter days has the
tranquillity of little britain been grievously disturbed and its golden
simplicity of manners threatened with total subversion by the aspiring
family of a retired butcher

the family of the lambs had long been among the most thriving and
popular in the neighborhood the miss lambs were the belles of little
britain and everybody was pleased when old lamb had made money enough
to shut up shop and put his name on a brass plate on his door in an
evil hour however one of the miss lambs had the honor of being a lady
in attendance on the lady mayoress at her grand annual ball on which
occasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head the
family never got over it they were immediately smitten with a passion
for high life set up a one-horse carriage put a bit of gold lace round
the errand-boy's hat and have been the talk and detestation of the
whole neighborhood ever since they could no longer be induced to
play at pope-joan or blindman's-buff they could endure no dances but
quadrilles which nobody had ever heard of in little britain and they
took to reading novels talking bad french and playing upon the piano
their brother too who had been articled to an attorney set up for a
dandy and a critic characters hitherto unknown in these parts and
he confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about kean the
opera and the edinburgh review

what was still worse the lambs gave a grand ball to which they
neglected to invite any of their old neighbors but they had a great
deal of genteel company from theobald's road red lion square and other
parts towards the west there were several beaux of their brother's
acquaintance from gray's inn lane and hatton garden and not less
than three aldermen's ladies with their daughters this was not to be
forgotten or forgiven all little britain was in an uproar with the
smacking of whips the lashing of in miserable horses and the rattling
and jingling of hackney-coaches the gossips of the neighborhood might
be seen popping their night-caps out at every window watching the crazy
vehicles rumble by and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that
kept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher's and
scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door

this dance was a cause of almost open war and the whole neighborhood
declared they would have nothing more to say to the lambs it is
true that mrs lamb when she had no engagements with her quality
acquaintance would give little humdrum tea-junketings to some of her
old cronies quite as she would say in a friendly way and it is
equally true that her invitations were always accepted in spite of all
previous vows to the contrary nay the good ladies would sit and be
delighted with the music of the miss lambs who would condescend to
strum an irish melody for them on the piano and they would listen
with wonderful interest to mrs lamb's anecdotes of alderman plunket's
family of portsoken ward and the miss timberlakes the rich heiresses
of crutched friars but then they relieved their consciences and averted
the reproaches of their confederates by canvassing at the next gossiping
convocation everything that had passed and pulling the lambs and their
rout all to pieces

the only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the
retired butcher himself honest lamb in spite of the meekness of his
name was a rough hearty old fellow with the voice of a lion a head
of black hair like a shoe-brush and a broad face mottled like his own
beef it was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as the old
gentleman addressed him as papa in tones of infinite softness
and endeavored to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers and other
gentlemanly habits do what they might there was no keeping down the
butcher his sturdy nature would break through all their glozings he
had a hearty vulgar good-humor that was irrepressible his very jokes
made his sensitive daughters shudder and he persisted in wearing his
blue cotton coat of a morning dining at two o'clock and having a bit
of sausage with his tea

he was doomed however to share the unpopularity of his family he
found his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him no
longer laughing at his jokes and now and then throwing out a fling at
some people and a hint about quality binding this both nettled
and perplexed the honest butcher and his wife and daughters with
the consummate policy of the shrewder sex taking advantage of the
circumstance at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoon's
pipe and tankard at wagstaff's to sit after dinner by himself and
take his pint of port a liquor he detested and to nod in his chair in
solitary and dismal gentility

the miss lambs might now be seen flaunting along the streets in french
bonnets with unknown beaux and talking and laughing so loud that it
distressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing they even went
so far as to attempt patronage and actually induced a french dancing
master to set up in the neighborhood but the worthy folks of little
britain took fire at it and did so persecute the poor gaul that he
was fain to pack up fiddle and dancing-pumps and decamp with such
precipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings

i had flattered myself at first with the idea that all this fiery
indignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of
their zeal for good old english manners and their horror of innovation
and i applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in
expressing for upstart pride french fashions and the miss lambs but
i grieve to say that i soon perceived the infection had taken hold
and that my neighbors after condemning were beginning to follow their
example i overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their
daughters have one quarter at french and music and that they might take
a few lessons in quadrille i even saw in the course of a few sundays
no less than five french bonnets precisely like those of the miss
lambs parading about little britain

i still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away that
the lambs might move out of the neighborhood might die or might run
away with attorneys apprentices and that quiet and simplicity might be
again restored to the community but unluckily a rival power arose an
opulent oilman died and left a widow with a large jointure and a family
of buxom daughters the young ladies had long been repining in secret
at the parsimony of a prudent father which kept down all their elegant
aspirings their ambition being now no longer restrained broke out
into a blaze and they openly took the field against the family of the
butcher it is true that the lambs having had the first start had
naturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career they could
speak a little bad french play the piano dance quadrilles and had
formed high acquaintances but the trotters were not to be distanced
when the lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats the miss
trotters mounted four and of twice as fine colors if the lambs gave
a dance the trotters were sure not to be behindhand and though they
might not boast of as good company yet they had double the number and
were twice as merry

the whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable
factions under the banners of these two families the old games of
pope-joan and tom-come-tickle-me are entirely discarded there is no
such thing as getting up an honest country dance and on my attempting
to kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last christmas i was
indignantly repulsed the miss lambs having pronounced it shocking
vulgar bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable
part of little britain the lambs standing up for the dignity
of cross-keys square and the trotters for the vicinity of st
bartholomew's

thus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions
like the great empire whose name it bears and what will be the result
would puzzle the apothecary himself with all his talent at prognostics
to determine though i apprehend that it will terminate in the total
downfall of genuine john bullism

the immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me being a single
man and as i observed before rather an idle good-for-nothing
personage i have been considered the only gentleman by profession in
the place i stand therefore in high favor with both parties and have
to hear all their cabinet counsels and mutual backbitings as i am too
civil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions i have committed
myself most horribly with both parties by abusing their opponents
i might manage to reconcile this to my conscience which is a truly
accommodating one but i cannot to my apprehension if the lambs and
trotters ever come to a reconciliation and compare notes i am ruined

i have determined therefore to beat a retreat in time and am actually
looking out for some other nest in this great city where old english
manners are still kept up where french is neither eaten drunk danced
nor spoken and where there are no fashionable families of retired
tradesmen this found i will like a veteran rat hasten away before i
have an old house about my ears bid a long though a sorrowful adieu
to my present abode and leave the rival factions of the lambs and the
trotters to divide the distracted empire of little britain




stratford-on-avon

thou soft-flowing avon by thy silver stream of things more than mortal
sweet shakespeare would dream the fairies by moonlight dance round his
green bed for hallow'd the turf is which pillow'd his head

garrick

to a homeless man who has no spot on this wide world which he can
truly call his own there is a momentary feeling of something like
independence and territorial consequence when after a weary day's
travel he kicks off his boots thrusts his feet into slippers and
stretches himself before an inn-fire let the world without go as it
may let kingdoms rise or fall so long as he has the wherewithal to pay
his bill he is for the time being the very monarch of all he surveys
the armchair is his throne the poker his sceptre and the little
parlor some twelve feet square his undisputed empire it is a morsel
of certainly snatched from the midst of the uncertainties of life it
is a sunny moment gleaming out kindly on a cloudy day and he who has
advanced some way on the pilgrimage of existence knows the importance of
husbanding even morsels and moments of enjoyment shall i not take mine
ease in mine inn thought i as i gave the fire a stir lolled back in
my elbow-chair and cast a complacent look about the little parlor of
the red horse at stratford-on-avon

the words of sweet shakespeare were just passing through my mind as
the clock struck midnight from the tower of the church in which he lies
buried there was a gentle tap at the door and a pretty chambermaid
putting in her smiling face inquired with a hesitating air whether i
had rung i understood it as a modest hint that it was time to retire
my dream of absolute dominion was at an end so abdicating my throne
like a prudent potentate to avoid being deposed and putting the
stratford guide-book under my arm as a pillow companion i went to bed
and dreamt all night of shakespeare the jubilee and david garrick

the next morning was one of those quickening mornings which we sometimes
have in early spring for it was about the middle of march the chills
of a long winter had suddenly given way the north wind had spent its
last gasp and a mild air came stealing from the west breathing the
breath of life into nature and wooing every bud and flower to burst
forth into fragrance and beauty

i had come to stratford on a poetical pilgrimage my first visit was to
the house where shakespeare was born and where according to tradition
he was brought up to his father's craft of wool-combing it is a small
mean-looking edifice of wood and plaster a true nestling-place of
genius which seems to delight in hatching its offspring in by-corners
the walls of its squalid chambers are covered with names and
inscriptions in every language by pilgrims of all nations ranks and
conditions from the prince to the peasant and present a simple but
striking instance of the spontaneous and universal homage of mankind to
the great poet of nature

the house is shown by a garrulous old lady in a frosty red face lighted
up by a cold blue anxious eye and garnished with artificial locks
of flaxen hair curling from under an exceedingly dirty cap she was
peculiarly assiduous in exhibiting the relics with which this like all
other celebrated shrines abounds there was the shattered stock of
the very matchlock with which shakespeare shot the deer on his poaching
exploits there too was his tobacco-box which proves that he was a
rival smoker of sir walter raleigh the sword also with which he played
hamlet and the identical lantern with which friar laurence discovered
romeo and juliet at the tomb there was an ample supply also of
shakespeare's mulberry tree which seems to have as extraordinary powers
of self-multiplication as the wood of the true cross of which there is
enough extant to build a ship of the line

the most favorite object of curiosity however is shakespeare's chair
it stands in a chimney-nook of a small gloomy chamber just behind what
was his father's shop here he may many a time have sat when a boy
watching the slowly revolving spit with all the longing of an urchin or
of an evening listening to the cronies and gossips of stratford dealing
forth churchyard tales and legendary anecdotes of the troublesome times
of england in this chair it is the custom of every one that visits the
house to sit whether this be done with the hope of imbibing any of
the inspiration of the bard i am at a loss to say i merely mention the
fact and mine hostess privately assured me that though built of solid
oak such was the fervent zeal of devotees the chair had to be new
bottomed at least once in three years it is worthy of notice also in
the history of this extraordinary chair that it partakes something of
the volatile nature of the santa casa of loretto or the flying chair
of the arabian enchanter for though sold some few years since to a
northern princess yet strange to tell it has found its way back again
to the old chimney-corner

i am always of easy faith in such matters and am ever willing to be
deceived where the deceit is pleasant and costs nothing i am therefore
a ready believer in relics legends and local anecdotes of goblins
and great men and would advise all travellers who travel for their
gratification to be the same what is it to us whether these stories be
true or false so long as we can persuade ourselves into the belief
of them and enjoy all the charm of the reality there is nothing like
resolute good-humored credulity in these matters and on this occasion i
went even so far as willingly to believe the claims of mine hostess to a
lineal descent from the poet when unluckily for my faith she put into
my hands a play of her own composition which set all belief in her own
consanguinity at defiance

from the birthplace of shakespeare a few paces brought me to his
grave he lies buried in the chancel of the parish church a large and
venerable pile mouldering with age but richly ornamented it stands on
the banks of the avon on an embowered point and separated by adjoining
gardens from the suburbs of the town its situation is quiet and
retired the river runs murmuring at the foot of the churchyard and
the elms which grow upon its banks droop their branches into its clear
bosom an avenue of limes the boughs of which are curiously interlaced
so as to form in summer an arched way of foliage leads up from the gate
of the yard to the church-porch the graves are overgrown with grass
the gray tombstones some of them nearly sunk into the earth are half
covered with moss which has likewise tinted the reverend old building
small birds have built their nests among the cornices and fissures of
the walls and keep up a continual flutter and chirping and rooks are
sailing and cawing about its lofty gray spire

in the course of my rambles i met with the gray-headed sexton edmonds
and accompanied him home to get the key of the church he had lived in
stratford man and boy for eighty years and seemed still to consider
himself a vigorous man with the trivial exception that he had nearly
lost the use of his legs for a few years past his dwelling was a
cottage looking out upon the avon and its bordering meadows and was a
picture of that neatness order and comfort which pervade the humblest
dwellings in this country a low whitewashed room with a stone floor
carefully scrubbed served for parlor kitchen and hall rows of pewter
and earthen dishes glittered along the dresser on an old oaken table
well rubbed and polished lay the family bible and prayer-book and the
drawer contained the family library composed of about half a score
of well-thumbed volumes an ancient clock that important article of
cottage furniture ticked on the opposite side of the room with
a bright warming-pan hanging on one side of it and the old man's
horn-handled sunday cane on the other the fireplace as usual was wide
and deep enough to admit a gossip knot within its jambs in one corner
sat the old man's granddaughter sewing a pretty blue-eyed girl and in
the opposite corner was a superannuated crony whom he addressed by
the name of john ange and who i found had been his companion from
childhood they had played together in infancy they had worked together
in manhood they were now tottering about and gossiping away the evening
of life and in a short time they will probably be buried together in
the neighboring churchyard it is not often that we see two streams of
existence running thus evenly and tranquilly side by side it is only in
such quiet bosom scenes of life that they are to be met with

i had hoped to gather some traditionary anecdotes of the bard from
these ancient chroniclers but they had nothing new to impart the long
interval during which shakespeare's writings lay in comparative neglect
has spread its shadow over his history and it is his good or evil lot
that scarcely anything remains to his biographers but a scanty handful
of conjectures

the sexton and his companion had been employed as carpenters on the
preparations for the celebrated stratford jubilee and they
remembered garrick the prime mover of the fete who superintended the
arrangements and who according to the sexton was a short punch man
very lively and bustling john ange had assisted also in cutting down
shakespeare's mulberry tree of which he had a morsel in his pocket for
sale no doubt a sovereign quickener of literary conception

i was grieved to hear these two worthy wights speak very dubiously of
the eloquent dame who shows the shakespeare house john ange shook
his head when i mentioned her valuable and inexhaustible collection
of relics particularly her remains of the mulberry tree and the old
sexton even expressed a doubt as to shakespeare having been born in her
house i soon discovered that he looked upon her mansion with an evil
eye as a rival to the poet's tomb the latter having comparatively but
few visitors thus it is that historians differ at the very outset and
mere pebbles make the stream of truth diverge into different channels
even at the fountain-head

we approached the church through the avenue of limes and entered by a
gothic porch highly ornamented with carved doors of massive oak the
interior is spacious and the architecture and embellishments superior
to those of most country churches there are several ancient monuments
of nobility and gentry over some of which hang funeral escutcheons and
banners dropping piecemeal from the walls the tomb of shakespeare is in
the chancel the place is solemn and sepulchral tall elms wave before
the pointed windows and the avon which runs at a short distance from
the walls keeps up a low perpetual murmur a flat stone marks the spot
where the bard is buried there are four lines inscribed on it said to
have been written by himself and which have in them something extremely
awful if they are indeed his own they show that solicitude about
the quiet of the grave which seems natural to fine sensibilities and
thoughtful minds

 good friend for jesus sake forbeare
 to dig the dust inclosed here
 blessed be he that spares these stones
 and curst be he that moves my bones

just over the grave in a niche of the wall is a bust of shakespeare
put up shortly after his death and considered as a resemblance the
aspect is pleasant and serene with a finely-arched forehead and i
thought i could read in it clear indications of that cheerful
social disposition by which he was as much characterized among his
contemporaries as by the vastness of his genius the inscription
mentions his age at the time of his decease fifty-three years an
untimely death for the world for what fruit might not have been
expected from the golden autumn of such a mind sheltered as it was
from the stormy vicissitudes of life and flourishing in the sunshine of
popular and royal favor

the inscription on the tombstone has not been without its effect it has
prevented the removal of his remains from the bosom of his native place
to westminster abbey which was at one time contemplated a few years
since also as some laborers were digging to make an adjoining vault
the earth caved in so as to leave a vacant space almost like an arch
through which one might have reached into his grave no one however
presumed to meddle with his remains so awfully guarded by a malediction
and lest any of the idle or the curious or any collector of relics
should be tempted to commit depredations the old sexton kept watch over
the place for two days until the vault was finished and the aperture
closed again he told me that he had made bold to look in at the
hole but could see neither coffin nor bones nothing but dust it was
something i thought to have seen the dust of shakespeare

next to this grave are those of his wife his favorite daughter
mrs hall and others of his family on a tomb close by also is a
full-length effigy of his old friend john combe of usurious memory
on whom he is said to have written a ludicrous epitaph there are other
monuments around but the mind refuses to dwell on anything that is not
connected with shakespeare his idea pervades the place the whole pile
seems but as his mausoleum the feelings no longer checked and thwarted
by doubt here indulge in perfect confidence other traces of him may be
false or dubious but here is palpable evidence and absolute certainty
as i trod the sounding pavement there was something intense and
thrilling in the idea that in very truth the remains of shakespeare were
mouldering beneath my feet it was a long time before i could prevail
upon myself to leave the place and as i passed through the churchyard
i plucked a branch from one of the yew trees the only relic that i have
brought from stratford

i had now visited the usual objects of a pilgrim's devotion but i had
a desire to see the old family seat of the lucys at charlecot and to
ramble through the park where shakespeare in company with some of
the roisterers of stratford committed his youthful offence of
deer-stealing in this harebrained exploit we are told that he was taken
prisoner and carried to the keeper's lodge where he remained all night
in doleful captivity when brought into the presence of sir thomas lucy
his treatment must have been galling and humiliating for it so wrought
upon his spirit as to produce a rough pasquinade which was affixed to
the park gate at charlecot

this flagitious attack upon the dignity of the knight so incensed him
that he applied to a lawyer at warwick to put the severity of the laws
in force against the rhyming deer-stalker shakespeare did not wait
to brave the united puissance of a knight of the shire and a country
attorney he forthwith abandoned the pleasant banks of the avon and
his paternal trade wandered away to london became a hanger-on to the
theatres then an actor and finally wrote for the stage and
thus through the persecution of sir thomas lucy stratford lost an
indifferent wool-comber and the world gained an immortal poet he
retained however for a long time a sense of the harsh treatment of
the lord of charlecot and revenged himself in his writings but in
the sportive way of a good-natured mind sir thomas is said to be the
original of justice shallow and the satire is slyly fixed upon him by
the justice's armorial bearings which like those of the knight had
white luces in the quarterings


 the following is the only stanza extant of this lampoon

 a parliament member a justice of peace
 at home a poor scarecrow at london an asse
 if lowsie is lucy as some volke miscalle it
 then lucy is lowsie whatever befall it
 he thinks himself great
 yet an asse in his state
 we allow by his ears but with asses to mate
 if lucy is lowsie as some volke miscalle it
 then sing lowsie lucy whatever befall it

 the luce is a pike or jack and abounds in the avon about
 charlecot


various attempts have been made by his biographers to soften and explain
away this early transgression of the poet but i look upon it as one
of those thoughtless exploits natural to his situation and turn of mind
shakespeare when young had doubtless all the wildness and irregularity
of an ardent undisciplined and undirected genius the poetic
temperament has naturally something in it of the vagabond when left to
itself it runs loosely and wildly and delights in everything eccentric
and licentious it is often a turn up of a die in the gambling freaks
of fate whether a natural genius shall turn out a great rogue or a
great poet and had not shakespeare's mind fortunately taken a literary
bias he might have as daringly transcended all civil as he has all
dramatic laws

i have little doubt that in early life when running like an unbroken
colt about the neighborbood of stratford he was to be found in the
company of all kinds of odd anomalous characters that he associated
with all the madcaps of the place and was one of those unlucky urchins
at mention of whom old men shake their heads and predict that they will
one day come to the gallows to him the poaching in sir thomas lucy's
park was doubtless like a foray to a scottish knight and struck
his eager and as yet untamed imagination as something delightfully
adventurous


 a proof of shakespeare's random habits and associates in
 his youthful days may be found in a traditionary anecdote
 picked up at stratford by the elder ireland and mentioned
 in his picturesque views on the avon

about seven miles from stratford lies the thirsty little market-town of
bedford famous for its ale two societies of the village yeomanry used
to meet under the appellation of the bedford topers and to challenge
the lovers of good ale of the neighboring villages to a contest of
drinking among others the people of stratford were called out to prove
the strength of their heads and in the number of the champions was
shakespeare who in spite of the proverb that they who drink beer
will think beer was as true to his ale as falstaff to his sack the
chivalry of stratford was staggered at the first onset and sounded a
retreat while they had yet the legs to carry them off the field they
had scarcely marched a mile when their legs failing them they were
forced to lie down under a crab tree where they passed the night it
was still standing and goes by the name of shakespeare's tree

in the morning his companions awaked the bard and proposed returning to
bedford but he declined saying he had enough having drank with

 piping pebworth dancing marston
 haunted hilbro hungry grafton
 dudging exhall papist wicksford
 beggarly broom and drunken bedford

the villages here alluded to says ireland still bear the epithets
thus given them the people of pebworth are still famed for their skill
on the pipe and tabor hilborough is now called haunted hilborough and
grafton is famous for the poverty of its soil


the old mansion of charlecot and its surrounding park still remain in
the possession of the lucy family and are peculiarly interesting front
being connected with this whimsical but eventful circumstance in the
scanty history of the bard as the house stood at little more than three
miles distance from stratford i resolved to pay it a pedestrian visit
that i might stroll leisurely through some of those scenes from which
shakespeare must have derived his earliest ideas of rural imagery

the country was yet naked and leafless but english scenery is always
verdant and the sudden change in the temperature of the weather
was surprising in its quickening effects upon the landscape it was
inspiring and animating to witness this first awakening of spring to
feel its warm breath stealing over the senses to see the moist mellow
earth beginning to put forth the green sprout and the tender blade and
the trees and shrubs in their reviving tints and bursting buds giving
the promise of returning foliage and flower the cold snow-drop that
little borderer on the skirts of winter was to be seen with its chaste
white blossoms in the small gardens before the cottages the bleating
of the new-dropt lambs was faintly heard from the fields the sparrow
twittered about the thatched eaves and budding hedges the robin threw
a livelier note into his late querulous wintry strain and the lark
springing up from the reeking bosom of the meadow towered away into the
bright fleecy cloud pouring forth torrents of melody as i watched the
little songster mounting up higher and higher until his body was a mere
speck on the white bosom of the cloud while the ear was still filled
with his music it called to mind shakespeare's exquisite little song in
cymbeline

 hark hark the lark at heav'n's gate sings
 and phoebus gins arise
 his steeds to water at those springs
 on chaliced flowers that lies

 and winking mary-buds begin
 to ope their golden eyes
 with every thing that pretty bin
 my lady sweet arise

indeed the whole country about here is poetic ground everything is
associated with the idea of shakespeare every old cottage that i saw
i fancied into some resort of his boyhood where he had acquired his
intimate knowledge of rustic life and manners and heard those legendary
tales and wild superstitions which he has woven like witchcraft into
his dramas for in his time we are told it was a popular amusement in
winter evenings to sit round the fire and tell merry tales of errant
knights queens lovers lords ladies giants dwarfs thieves
cheaters witches fairies goblins and friars


 scot in his discoverie of witchcraft enumerates a of
 these fireside fancies and they have so fraid us with host
 bull-beggars spirits witches urchins elves hags
 fairies satyrs pans faunes syrens kit with the can
 sticke tritons centaurs dwarfes giantes imps calcars
 conjurors nymphes changelings incubus robin-goodfellow
 the spoorne the mare the man in the oke the hell-waine
 the fier drake the puckle tom thombe hobgoblins tom
 tumbler boneless and such other bugs that we were afraid
 of our own shadowes


my route for a part of the way lay in sight of the avon which made
a variety of the most fancy doublings and windings through a wide and
fertile valley sometimes glittering from among willows which fringed
its borders sometimes disappearing among groves or beneath green banks
and sometimes rambling out into full view and making an azure sweep
round a slope of meadow-land this beautiful bosom of country is called
the vale of the red horse a distant line of undulating blue hills seems
to be its boundary whilst all the soft intervening landscape lies in a
manner enchained in the silver links of the avon

after pursuing the road for about three miles i turned off into a
footpath which led along the borders of fields and under hedgerows to a
private gate of the park there was a stile however for the benefit of
the pedestrian there being a public right of way through the grounds
i delight in these hospitable estates in which every one has a kind
of property at least as far as the footpath is concerned it in some
measure reconciles a poor man to his lot and what is more to the
better lot of his neighbor thus to have parks and pleasure-grounds
thrown open for his recreation he breathes the pure air as freely and
lolls as luxuriously under the shade as the lord of the soil and if he
has not the privilege of calling all that he sees his own he has not
at the same time the trouble of paying for it and keeping it in order

i now found myself among noble avenues of oaks and elms whose vast size
bespoke the growth of centuries the wind sounded solemnly among
their branches and the rooks cawed from their hereditary nests in the
tree-tops the eye ranged through a long lessening vista with nothing
to interrupt the view but a distant statue and a vagrant deer stalking
like a shadow across the opening

there is something about these stately old avenues that has the effect
of gothic architecture not merely from the pretended similarity of
form but from their bearing the evidence of long duration and of
having had their origin in a period of time with which we associate
ideas of romantic grandeur they betoken also the long-settled dignity
and proudly-concentrated independence of an ancient family and i have
heard a worthy but aristocratic old friend observe when speaking of the
sumptuous palaces of modern gentry that money could do much with
stone and mortar but thank heaven there was no such thing as suddenly
building up an avenue of oaks

it was from wandering in early life among this rich scenery and about
the romantic solitudes of the adjoining park of fullbroke which then
formed a part of the lucy estate that some of shakepeare's commentators
have supposed he derived his noble forest meditations of jaques and
the enchanting woodland pictures in as you like it it is in lonely
wanderings through such scenes that the mind drinks deep but quiet
draughts of inspiration and becomes intensely sensible of the beauty
and majesty of nature the imagination kindles into reverie and rapture
vague but exquisite images and ideas keep breaking upon it and we revel
in a mute and almost incommunicable luxury of thought it was in some
such mood and perhaps under one of those very trees before me which
threw their broad shades over the grassy banks and quivering waters of
the avon that the poet's fancy may have sallied forth into that little
song which breathes the very soul of a rural voluptuary

 unto the greenwood tree
 who loves to lie with me
 and tune his merry throat
 unto the sweet bird's note
 come hither come hither come hither
 here shall he see
 no enemy
 but winter and rough weather

i had now come in sight of the house it is a large building of brick
with stone quoins and is in the gothic style of queen elizabeth's day
having been built in the first year of her reign the exterior remains
very nearly in its original state and may be considered a fair specimen
of the residence of a wealthy country gentleman of those days a great
gateway opens from the park into a kind of courtyard in front of the
house ornamented with a grassplot shrubs and flower-beds the gateway
is in imitation of the ancient barbacan being a kind of outpost and
flanked by towers though evidently for mere ornament instead of
defence the front of the house is completely in the old style with
stone-shafted casements a great bow-window of heavy stone-work and a
portal with armorial bearings over it carved in stone at each corner
of the building is an octagon tower surmounted by a gilt ball and
weather-cock

the avon which winds through the park makes a bend just at the foot
of a gently-sloping bank which sweeps down from the rear of the house
large herds of deer were feeding or reposing upon its borders and
swans were sailing majestically upon its bosom as i contemplated the
venerable old mansion i called to mind falstaff's encomium on justice
shallow's abode and the affected indifference and real vanity of the
latter

falstaff you have a goodly dwelling and a rich shallow barren
barren barren beggars all beggars all sir john marry good air

whatever may have been the joviality of the old mansion in the days of
shakespeare it had now an air of stillness and solitude the great iron
gateway that opened into the courtyard was locked there was no show
of servants bustling about the place the deer gazed quietly at me as i
passed being no longer harried by the moss-troopers of stratford the
only sign of domestic life that i met with was a white cat stealing with
wary look and stealthy pace towards the stables as if on some nefarious
expedition i must not omit to mention the carcass of a scoundrel crow
which i saw suspended against the barn-wall as it shows that the lucys
still inherit that lordly abhorrence of poachers and maintain that
rigorous exercise of territorial power which was so strenuously
manifested in the case of the bard

after prowling about for some time i at length found my way to a
lateral portal which was the every-day entrance to the mansion i was
courteously received by a worthy old housekeeper who with the civility
and communicativeness of her order showed me the interior of the house
the greater part has undergone alterations and been adapted to modern
tastes and modes of living there is a fine old oaken staircase and the
great hall that noble feature in an ancient manor-house still retains
much of the appearance it must have had in the days of shakespeare the
ceiling is arched and lofty and at one end is a gallery in which stands
an organ the weapons and trophies of the chase which formerly adorned
the hall of a country gentleman have made way for family portraits
there is a wide hospitable fireplace calculated for an ample
old-fashioned wood fire formerly the rallying-place of winter
festivity on the opposite side of the hall is the huge gothic
bow-window with stone shafts which looks out upon the courtyard here
are emblazoned in stained glass the armorial bearings of the lucy family
for many generations some being dated in i was delighted to
observe in the quarterings the three white luces by which the character
of sir thomas was first identified with that of justice shallow they
are mentioned in the first scene of the merry wives of windsor where
the justice is in a rage with falstaff for having beaten his men
killed his deer and broken into his lodge the poet had no doubt the
offences of himself and his comrades in mind at the time and we may
suppose the family pride and vindictive threats of the puissant shallow
to be a caricature of the pompous indignation of sir thomas

shallow sir hugh persuade me not i will make a star chamber matter
of it if he were twenty john falstaffs he shall not abuse sir robert
shallow esq

slender in the county of gloster justice of peace and coram

shallow ay cousin slender and custalorum

slender ay and ratolorum too and a gentleman born master parson who
writes himself armigero in any bill warrant quittance or obligation
armigero

shallow ay that i do and have done any time these three hundred
years

slender all his successors gone before him have done't and all his
ancestors that come after him may they may give the dozen white luces
in their coat

shallow the council shall hear it it is a riot

evans it is not meet the council hear of a riot there is no fear of
got in a riot the council hear you shall desire to hear the fear of
got and not to hear a riot take your vizaments in that

shallow ha o my life if i were young again the sword should end
it

near the window thus emblazoned hung a portrait by sir peter lely
of one of the lucy family a great beauty of the time of charles
the second the old housekeeper shook her head as she pointed to the
picture and informed me that this lady had been sadly addicted to
cards and had gambled away a great portion of the family estate among
which was that part of the park where shakespeare and his comrades had
killed the deer the lands thus lost had not been entirely regained by
the family even at the present day it is but justice to this recreant
dame to confess that she had a surpassingly fine hand and arm

the picture which most attracted my attention was a great painting over
the fireplace containing likenesses of sir thomas lucy and his family
who inhabited the hall in the latter part of shakespeare's lifetime
i at first thought that it was the vindictive knight himself but the
housekeeper assured me that it was his son the only likeness extant
of the former being an effigy upon his tomb in the church of the
neighboring hamlet of charlecot


 this effigy is in white marble and represents the knight
 in complete armor near him lies the effigy of his wife and
 on her tomb is the following inscription which if really
 composed by her husband places him quite above the
 intellectual level of master shallow

 here lyeth the lady joyce lucy wife of sir thomas lucy of
 charlecot in ye county of warwick knight daughter and heir
 of thomas acton of sutton in ye county of worcester esquire
 who departed out of this wretched world to her heavenly
 kingdom ye day of february in ye yeare of our lord god
 and of her age and three all the time of her lyfe a
 true and faythful servant of her good god never detected of
 any cryme or vice in religion most sounde in love to her
 husband most faythful and true in friendship most constant
 to what in trust was committed unto her most secret in
 wisdom excelling in governing of her house bringing up of
 youth in ye fear of god that did converse with her moste
 rare and singular a great maintayner of hospitality
 greatly esteemed of her betters misliked of none unless of
 the envyous when all is spoken that can be saide a woman so
 garnished with virtue as not to be bettered and hardly to be
 equalled by any as shee lived most virtuotisly so shee died
 most godly set downe by him yt best did knowe what hath byn
 written to be true

 thomas lucye


the picture gives a lively idea of the costume and manners of the time
sir thomas is dressed in ruff and doublet white shoes with roses in
them and has a peaked yellow or as master slender would say a
cane-colored beard his lady is seated on the opposite side of the
picture in wide ruff and long stomacher and the children have a most
venerable stiffness and formality of dress hounds and spaniels are
mingled in the family group a hawk is seated on his perch in the
foreground and one of the children holds a bow all intimating the
knight's skill in hunting hawking and archery so indispensable to an
accomplished gentleman in those days


 bishop earle speaking of the country gentleman of his
 time observes his housekeeping is seen much in the
 different families of dogs and serving-men attendant on
 their kennels and the deepness of their throats is the
 depth of his discourse a hawk he esteems the true burden of
 nobility and is exceedingly ambitious to seem delighted
 with the sport and have his fist gloved with his jesses
 and gilpin in his description of a mr hastings remarks
 he kept all sorts of hounds that run buck fox hare
 otter and badger and had hawks of all kinds both long and
 short winged his great hall was commonly strewed with
 marrow-bones and full of hawk perches hounds spaniels
 and terriers on a broad hearth paved with brick lay some
 of the choicest terriers hounds and spaniels


i regretted to find that the ancient furniture of the hall had
disappeared for i had hoped to meet with the stately elbow-chair of
carved oak in which the country squire of former days was wont to sway
the sceptre of empire over his rural domains and in which it might be
presumed the redoubled sir thomas sat enthroned in awful state when
the recreant shakespeare was brought before him as i like to deck out
pictures for my own entertainment i pleased myself with the idea that
this very hall had been the scene of the unlucky bard's examination on
the morning after his captivity in the lodge i fancied to myself the
rural potentate surrounded by his body-guard of butler pages and
blue-coated serving-men with their badges while the luckless culprit
was brought in forlorn and chopfallen in the custody of gamekeepers
huntsmen and whippers-in and followed by a rabble rout of country
clowns i fancied bright faces of curious housemaids peeping from the
half-opened doors while from the gallery the fair daughters of the
knight leaned gracefully forward eyeing the youthful prisoner with that
pity that dwells in womanhood who would have thought that this poor
varlet thus trembling before the brief authority of a country squire
and the sport of rustic boors was soon to become the delight of
princes the theme of all tongues and ages the dictator to the human
mind and was to confer immortality on his oppressor by a caricature and
a lampoon

i was now invited by the butler to walk into the garden and i felt
inclined to visit the orchard and harbor where the justice treated sir
john falstaff and cousin silence to a last year's pippin of his own
grafting with a dish of caraways but i had already spent so much
of the day in my ramblings that i was obliged to give up any further
investigations when about to take my leave i was gratified by the
civil entreaties of the housekeeper and butler that i would take some
refreshment an instance of good old hospitality which i grieve to say
we castle-hunters seldom meet with in modern days i make no doubt it is
a virtue which the present representative of the lucys inherits from
his ancestors for shakespeare even in his caricature makes justice
shallow importunate in this respect as witness his pressing instances
to falstaff

by cock and pye sir you shall not away to-night i will not
excuse you you shall not be excused excuses shall not be admitted
there is no excuse shall serve you shall not be excused some
pigeons davy a couple of short-legged hens a joint of mutton and any
pretty little tiny kickshaws tell william cook

i now bade a reluctant farewell to the old hall my mind had become so
completely possessed by the imaginary scenes and characters connected
with it that i seemed to be actually living among them everything
brought them as it were before my eyes and as the door of the
dining-room opened i almost expected to hear the feeble voice of master
silence quavering forth his favorite ditty

 tis merry in hall when beards wag all
 and welcome merry shrove-tide

on returning to my inn i could not but reflect on the singular gift of
the poet to be able thus to spread the magic of his mind over the very
face of nature to give to things and places a charm and character
not their own and to turn this working-day world into a perfect
fairy-land he is indeed the true enchanter whose spell operates
not upon the senses but upon the imagination and the heart under the
wizard influence of shakespeare i had been walking all day in a complete
delusion i had surveyed the landscape through the prism of poetry
which tinged every object with the hues of the rainbow i had been
surrounded with fancied beings with mere airy nothings conjured up
by poetic power yet which to me had all the charm of reality i had
heard jaques soliloquize beneath his oak had beheld the fair rosalind
and her companion adventuring through the woodlands and above all
had been once more present in spirit with fat jack falstaff and his
contemporaries from the august justice shallow down to the gentle
master slender and the sweet anne page ten thousand honors and
blessings on the bard who has thus gilded the dull realities of life
with innocent illusions who has spread exquisite and unbought pleasures
in my chequered path and beguiled my spirit in many a lonely hour with
all the cordial and cheerful sympathies of social life

as i crossed the bridge over the avon on my return i paused to
contemplate the distant church in which the poet lies buried and could
not but exult in the malediction which has kept his ashes undisturbed
in its quiet and hallowed vaults what honor could his name have
derived from being mingled in dusty companionship with the epitaphs
and escutcheons and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude what would
a crowded corner in westminster abbey have been compared with this
reverend pile which seems to stand in beautiful loneliness as his sole
mausoleum the solitude about the grave may be but the offspring of
an overwrought sensibility but human nature is made up of foibles and
prejudices and its best and tenderest affections are mingled with these
factitious feelings he who has sought renown about the world and has
reaped a full harvest of worldly favor will find after all that there
is no love no admiration no applause so sweet to the soul as that
which springs up in his native place it is there that he seeks to be
gathered in peace and honor among his kindred and his early friends and
when the weary heart and failing head begin to warn him that the evening
of life is drawing on he turns as fondly as does the infant to
the mother's arms to sink to sleep in the bosom of the scene of his
childhood

how would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard when
wandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful world he cast back a heavy
look upon his paternal home could he have foreseen that before many
years he should return to it covered with renown that his name should
become the boast and glory of his native place that his ashes should
be religiously guarded as its most precious treasure and that its
lessening spire on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation
should one day become the beacon towering amidst the gentle landscape to
guide the literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb




traits of indian character

i appeal to any white man if ever he entered logan's cabin hungry and
he gave him not to eat if ever he came cold and naked and he clothed
him not speech of au indian chief

there is something in the character and habits of the north american
savage taken in connection with the scenery over which he is accustomed
to range its vast lakes boundless forests majestic rivers and
trackless plains that is to my mind wonderfully striking and sublime
he is formed for the wilderness as the arab is for the desert
his nature is stern simple and enduring fitted to grapple with
difficulties and to support privations there seems but little soil in
his heart for the support of the kindly virtues and yet if we would
but take the trouble to penetrate through that proud stoicism
and habitual taciturnity which lock up his character from casual
observation we should find him linked to his fellow-man of civilized
life by more of those sympathies and affections than are usually
ascribed to him

it has been the lot of the unfortunate aborigines of america in the
early periods of colonization to be doubly wronged by the white men
they have been dispossessed of their hereditary possessions by mercenary
and frequently wanton warfare and their characters have been traduced
by bigoted and interested writers the colonists often treated them like
beasts of the forest and the author has endeavored to justify him
in his outrages the former found it easier to exterminate than to
civilize the latter to vilify than to discriminate the appellations of
savage and pagan were deemed sufficient to sanction the hostilities
of both and thus the poor wanderers of the forest were persecuted and
defamed not because they were guilty but because they were ignorant

the rights of the savage have seldom been properly appreciated or
respected by the white man in peace he has too often been the dupe of
artful traffic in war he has been regarded as a ferocious animal whose
life or death was a question of mere precaution and convenience man
is cruelly wasteful of life when his own safety is endangered and he is
sheltered by impunity and little mercy is to be expected from him
when he feels the sting of the reptile and is conscious of the power to
destroy

the same prejudices which were indulged thus early exist in common
circulation at the present day certain learned societies have it is
true with laudable diligence endeavored to investigate and record
the real characters and manners of the indian tribes the american
government too has wisely and humanely exerted itself to inculcate
a friendly and forbearing spirit towards them and to protect them from
fraud and injustice the current opinion of the indian character
however is too apt to be formed from the miserable hordes which infest
the frontiers and hang on the skirts of the settlements these are too
commonly composed of degenerate beings corrupted and enfeebled by the
vices of society without being benefited by its civilization that
proud independence which formed the main pillar of savage virtue has
been shaken down and the whole moral fabric lies in ruins their
spirits are humiliated and debased by a sense of inferiority and their
native courage cowed and daunted by the superior knowledge and power of
their enlightened neighbors society has advanced upon them like one of
those withering airs that will sometimes breed desolation over a whole
region of fertility it has enervated their strength multiplied their
diseases and superinduced upon their original barbarity the low vices
of artificial life it has given them a thousand superfluous wants
whilst it has diminished their means of mere existence it has driven
before it the animals of the chase who fly from the sound of the axe
and the smoke of the settlement and seek refuge in the depths of remoter
forests and yet untrodden wilds thus do we too often find the indians
on our frontiers to be the mere wrecks and remnants of once powerful
tribes who have lingered in the vicinity of the settlements and sunk
into precarious and vagabond existence poverty repining and hopeless
poverty a canker of the mind unknown in savage life corrodes their
spirits and blights every free and noble quality of their natures they
become drunken indolent feeble thievish and pusillanimous they
loiter like vagrants about the settlements among spacious dwellings
replete with elaborate comforts which only render them sensible of
the comparative wretchedness of their own condition luxury spreads its
ample board before their eyes but they are excluded from the banquet
plenty revels over the fields but they are starving in the midst of its
abundance the whole wilderness has blossomed into a garden but they
feel as reptiles that infest it


 the american government has been indefatigable in its
 exertions to ameliorate the situation of the indians and to
 introduce among them the arts of civilization and civil and
 religious knowledge to protect them from the frauds of the
 white traders no purchase of land from them by individuals
 is permitted nor is any person allowed to receive lands
 from them as a present without the express sanction of
 government these precautions are strictly enforced


how different was their state while yet the undisputed lords of the
soil their wants were few and the means of gratification within their
reach they saw every one round them sharing the same lot enduring the
same hardships feeding on the same aliments arrayed in the same rude
garments no roof then rose but was open to the homeless stranger no
smoke curled among the trees but he was welcome to sit down by its fire
and join the hunter in his repast for says an old historian of new
england their life is so void of care and they are so loving also
that they make use of those things they enjoy as common goods and are
therein so compassionate that rather than one should starve through
want they would starve all thus they pass their time merrily not
regarding our pomp but are better content with their own which some
men esteem so meanly of such were the indians whilst in the pride
and energy of their primitive natures they resembled those wild plants
which thrive best in the shades of the forest but shrink from the hand
of cultivation and perish beneath the influence of the sun

in discussing the savage character writers have been too prone to
indulge in vulgar prejudice and passionate exaggeration instead of the
candid temper of true philosophy they have not sufficiently considered
the peculiar circumstances in which the indians have been placed and
the peculiar principles under which they have been educated no being
acts more rigidly from rule than the indian his whole conduct is
regulated according to some general maxims early implanted in his mind
the moral laws that govern him are to be sure but few but then he
conforms to them all the white man abounds in laws of religion morals
and manners but how many does he violate

a frequent ground of accusation against the indians is their disregard
of treaties and the treachery and wantonness with which in time of
apparent peace they will suddenly fly to hostilities the intercourse
of the white men with the indians however is too apt to be cold
distrustful oppressive and insulting they seldom treat them with that
confidence and frankness which are indispensable to real friendship nor
is sufficient caution observed not to offend against those feelings of
pride or superstition which often prompt the indian to hostility
quicker than mere considerations of interest the solitary savage feels
silently but acutely his sensibilities are not diffused over so wide
a surface as those of the white man but they run in steadier and deeper
channels his pride his affections his superstitions are all
directed towards fewer objects but the wounds inflicted on them are
proportionably severe and furnish motives of hostility which we cannot
sufficiently appreciate where a community is also limited in number
and forms one great patriarchal family as in an indian tribe the
injury of an individual is the injury of the whole and the sentiment
of vengeance is almost instantaneously diffused one council-fire is
sufficient for the discussion and arrangement of a plan of hostilities
here all the fighting-men and sages assemble eloquence and superstition
combine to inflame the minds of the warriors the orator awakens
their martial ardor and they are wrought up to a kind of religious
desperation by the visions of the prophet and the dreamer

an instance of one of those sudden exasperations arising from a motive
peculiar to the indian character is extant in an old record of the
early settlement of massachusetts the planters of plymouth had defaced
the monuments of the dead at passonagessit and had plundered the grave
of the sachem's mother of some skins with which it had been decorated
the indians are remarkable for the reverence which they entertain for
the sepulchres of their kindred tribes that have passed generations
exiled from the abodes of their ancestors when by chance they have
been travelling in the vicinity have been known to turn aside from the
highway and guided by wonderfully accurate tradition have crossed the
country for miles to some tumulus buried perhaps in woods where the
bones of their tribe were anciently deposited and there have passed
hours in silent meditation influenced by this sublime and holy feeling
the sachem whose mother's tomb had been violated gathered his men
together and addressed them in the following beautifully simple
and pathetic harangue a curious specimen of indian eloquence and an
affecting instance of filial piety in a savage

when last the glorious light of all the sky was underneath this globe
and birds grew silent i began to settle as my custom is to take
repose before mine eyes were fast closed methought i saw a vision at
which my spirit was much troubled and trembling at that doleful sight
a spirit cried aloud behold my son whom i have cherished see the
breasts that gave thee suck the hands that lapped thee warm and fed
thee oft canst thou forget to take revenge of those wild people
who have defaced my monument in a despiteful manner disdaining our
antiquities and honorable customs see now the sachem's grave lies
like the common people defaced by an ignoble race thy mother doth
complain and implores thy aid against this thievish people who have
newly intruded on our land if this be suffered i shall not rest quiet
in my everlasting habitation this said the spirit vanished and i
all in a sweat not able scarce to speak began to get some strength
and recollect my spirits that were fled and determined to demand your
counsel and assistance

i have adduced this anecdote at some length as it tends to show how
these sudden acts of hostility which have been attributed to caprice
and perfidy may often arise from deep and generous motives which
our inattention to indian character and customs prevents our properly
appreciating

another ground of violent outcry against the indians is their barbarity
to the vanquished this had its origin partly in policy and partly in
superstition the tribes though sometimes called nations were never
so formidable in their numbers but that the loss of several warriors
was sensibly felt this was particularly the case when they had been
frequently engaged in warfare and many an instance occurs in indian
history where a tribe that had long been formidable to its neighbors
has been broken up and driven away by the capture and massacre of its
principal fighting-men there was a strong temptation therefore to the
victor to be merciless not so much to gratify any cruel revenge as
to provide for future security the indians had also the superstitious
belief frequent among barbarous nations and prevalent also among the
ancients that the manes of their friends who had fallen in battle were
soothed by the blood of the captives the prisoners however who are
not thus sacrificed are adopted into their families in the place of the
slain and are treated with the confidence and affection of relatives
and friends nay so hospitable and tender is their entertainment that
when the alternative is offered them they will often prefer to remain
with their adopted brethren rather than return to the home and the
friends of their youth

the cruelty of the indians towards their prisoners has been heightened
since the colonization of the whites what was formerly a compliance
with policy and superstition has been exasperated into a gratification
of vengeance they cannot but be sensible that the white men are the
usurpers of their ancient dominion the cause of their degradation and
the gradual destroyers of their race they go forth to battle smarting
with injuries and indignities which they have individually suffered and
they are driven to madness and despair by the wide-spreading desolation
and the overwhelming ruin of european warfare the whites have too
frequently set them an example of violence by burning their villages
and laying waste their slender means of subsistence and yet they wonder
that savages do not show moderation and magnanimity towards those who
have left them nothing but mere existence and wretchedness

we stigmatize the indians also as cowardly and treacherous because
they use stratagem in warfare in preference to open force but in this
they are fully justified by their rude code of honor they are early
taught that stratagem is praiseworthy the bravest warrior thinks it
no disgrace to lurk in silence and take every advantage of his foe he
triumphs in the superior craft and sagacity by which he has been enabled
to surprise and destroy an enemy indeed man is naturally more prone to
subtilty than open valor owing to his physical weakness in comparison
with other animals they are endowed with natural weapons of defence
with horns with tusks with hoofs and talons but man has to depend
on his superior sagacity in all his encounters with these his proper
enemies he resorts to stratagem and when he perversely turns his
hostility against his fellow-man he at first continues the same subtle
mode of warfare

the natural principle of war is to do the most harm to our enemy with
the least harm to ourselves and this of course is to be effected by
stratagem that chivalrous courage which induces us to despise the
suggestions of prudence and to rush in the face of certain danger is the

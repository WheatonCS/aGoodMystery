i do not pretend in these little
volumes to give anything like a complete
picture oriental manners
scenery geography or history my
object is to interest the young less
by elaborate descriptions than by such
slight sketches as would grow out 
the unrestrained familiarity happy
domestic life to subjects an exclusive
character it is almost impossible
to keep alive the attention 
vi 
children impressionable as they are
the impression must be varied in order
to be attractive perhaps even to be
instructive in these rude pictures 
the east there is no invention they
are the vivid recollections men and
things seen under circumstances favourable
to the writer and which
made many objects accessible to him
which are not accessible to the ordinary
traveller
as to the stories connected with
oriental superstitions i have recorded
them as i heard them without adding
or subtracting a single circumstance
they appeared to me well fitted to
give some variety to the conversations
and to have the merit illustrating

eastern character these form but a
small portion the number i collected
i do not see how such narratives
can be injurious to the minds
 children who may safely be trusted
with such tales wonder and mystery
in these days and in a country
so much emancipated from superstition
and credulity as our own would the
emancipation were complete they
may exercise their minds in endeavouring
to explain apparently supernatural
events by ordinary causes an
explanation may no doubt be found
when tip exaggerations ignorance
are cleared away
i have thought it desirable to carry
out the plan i originally proposed
 
to myself in the earlier volumes 
minor morals by introducing some
variety subjects in order to prevent
the weariness attention too lonof directed
to the same topic
travels
 o how i wish i could travel into foreign
countries exclaimed george one day who
had been delighted with a promise mr
howard that he would talk to them all about
his journey into oriental lands
i often dream about travelling added
edith and all sorts places come into my
head and i fancy i am there i should
like to see them and to compare my fancy
 them with what they really are
but as that cannot be said mr howard
what an advantage it is to have books
written by intelligent people who come and
tell us what they have seen and enable us
if vol iii b
 minor morals
without any difficulty or danger to accompany
them in their long journies who show us
what is most interesting and do not weary
us with what is dull or disagreeable there
was a very amusing fellow at florence who
used in the piazza the grand duke to
gather crowds about him by its accounts 
distant regions now we will go to petersburg
he would say or what is better
i will take you there for if you went yourself
it would cost you a mint money and you
might be frozen among the snows or break
your neck on the corduroy roads and would
be certainly cheated by the postillions and
tormented by the police but i will tell you
about the winter palace and the marble
palace and the river neva and the statue
 peter the great and the icehills and
the sledges and the long beards the peasants
and the northern lights and when you
travels 
are tired this i will convey you witlioiit
any fear bandits or the fevers the
pontine marshes to rome and i will show
you the holy father in the vatican and
the sublime cathedral st peter and the
forum and the tarpeian rock and you
shall neither be wearied nor annoyed all the
way 
i think said george i should enjoy
the weariness and annoyance such interesting
journies because i know one could not
have the journey without the annoyance and
then papa when the trouble is over it is
very pleasant to recollect and to be able to
talk to our friends the difficulties and
dangers we have passed through
well my boy answered mr howard
i hope you will think so when the difficulties
and dangers really come you will be all
the better for your determination and you
 minor morals
will have i dare say in after life many
and many an opportunity using your courageous
philosophy
did you ever suffer much from climate
papa inquired edith for even here our
hot summers melt us and our cold vvdnters
freeze us and we have much ado to keep
ourselves comfortable
there are inconveniences my dear many
and great but considering how extremely
unlike the habitable regions the earth are
to one another i often think with delight
upon the facility with which the human being
supports them all the provisions nature
for the maintenance life are various and
wonderful man whose wants and curiosity
induce him to visit such different climates
is all animals the best adapted to various
temperatures and finds the means accommodating
himself to great fluctuations heat
travels 
and cold you have heard living persons
passing in a hot oven time enough to roast a
joint meat in russia the peasants often
come forth from their hot steam baths and
roll themselves in the snow and i remember
to have heard berzelius the great swedish
chemist remark that all the substances
he had ever made experiments on the human
skin was that which most easily and with
the least alteration accommodated itself to the
action different temperatures animals you
know change much their nature under the
influence climate the wool the sheep
becomes hairy in the south the hair the
rat becomes woolly in the north seeds do
not lose their germinating power under any
natural heat or cold not that seeds will
grow in all climates but they may be preserved
in them tropical seeds would not
lose their power reproduction by a voyage
 minor morals
to the north nor would a visit to the equator
destroy those the coldest regions
 i have heard papa said george that
the vital principle is so vigorous that there
have been found in herculaneum and pompeii
closed up from the action the air grains
 corn which have sprung forth when planted
in the appropriate place and season grains
whose life would have been thought extinguished
nearly eighteen hundred years ago
what an advantage said arthur the
present time has over the past a long
journey can now be accomplished far more
easily than a short one in ancient days
yes said mr howard the progress
 science is nowhere so visible as in the
removal difficulties in the way communication
in saxon times the merchant who
had undertaken three sea voyages for his own
account was admitted into the ranks honour
travels 
obtaining the title thane a traveller
into remote countries was an object admiration
 and indeed in all ages he has
perhaps been the most valuable aid to human
happiness he has opened the way to the
knowledge and the possession ten thousand
sources enjoyment
now papa you have travelled so much
tell me after all what is the most pleasant
 all your travelling recollections 
indeed edith the most agreeable 
my thoughts is this that the whole universe
is full felicity that if there are sufferings
and sorrows in the world they are exceptions
to the general rule we sometimes think
that the deprivation pleasures such as we
possess must be accompanied by much annoyance
and wretchedness but our judgments
on such matters are generally erroneous i
will give you one or two examples from my
 minor morals
own experience showing how the mind accommodates
itself to the circumstances that
surround it
i went once into the hut a russian
serf it was made logs wood and
though the winter was bitterly cold the only
windows were small square holes through
which the snow was driven by the sharp
winds and when the door was opened in
there rushed showers sleet and hoarfrost
within was a smoky and suffocating heat
produced by the burning damp wood in a
stove the inhabitants were a boor his wife
and three children covered with dirt and
vermin and the whole family were the
vassals a neighbouring nobleman they
were attached to the soil according to the
feudal usages had no will their own they
could possess no property and were almost
without any legal right ah they could gain
travels 
was claimed by and paid to their master and
 the produce the fields they cultivated
no part came to their share but such a portion
as enabled them to support existence the
intolerableness slavery we often hear 
and it is well that slavery should appear
intolerable to the free but when the slave
cannot shake off his fetters it is to him at
least a privilege to be contented with his
position i was curious to hear what notions
a russian boor had freedom and his
own condition peter petrovich was sitting
in his ragged sheepskin garment on a block
 wood carving a common amusement 
the peasant ornaments out the thigh bone
 an ox i sat down by him and asked
how far he had ever travelled never ten
verses from where i was born said he
should not you like to see a great city 
 i have heard one i don't know what
b 
 minor morals
was its name from ivan carlovich and that's
enough for me can you read or write 
 not i what would be the use reading
or writing the priest reads to me and
saves me the trouble and i have nobody to
write to and nothing to write about should
you not like a better house i do not
know what i should do with it it would only
add to my trouble the love independence
is often said to be an instinct man a
natural irrepressible feeling but when i
asked peter petrovich if he ever thought 
buying his freedom endeavouring to become
his own master he looked surprised and said 
am i a fool do not i know when i am
well off must not my lord provide for me 
how could i provide for myself it was
in vain i sought to touch a chord which is
said to vibrate on all minds the love 
liberty but liberty to him was to have to
travels 
take no care for himself j he fancied he should
be cumbered and perplexed about the means
 existence no no said he my lord
must keep me from starvation must give mea
house to live in and garments if i vant
them i free who is to feed me clothe
me shelter me but my master but surely
if you were to labour for yourself and keep
all the money you gain you might have
better food and garments and a more comfortable
house it was in vain to talk to
peter petrovich my master must provide
for me was the burthen his story he
felt like a child unaccustomed to walk alone
when the hand that guides it is about to be
withdrawn or a boy unable to swim who
is menaced with being placed out his depth
in the water and perhaps there will be
many a generation peter petroviches before
 minor morals
any desire to change their condition will prevail
among the peasant serfs russia
 is it not a lamentable state things
that they should be so deadened to all generous
feeling inquired george
it would be yet more lamentable if
without any chance happy change they were
sensible their degraded state but by and
by commerce and the silent spread improvement
will produce uncomfortable feelings
and they will contrast their condition
with that happier nations and then moved
either by the fears their revolt or by a more
benevolent principle such as the desire to promote
their improvement their government will
emancipate them by its own act or they will
obtain their emancipation by their united exertions
such is the progress intelligence
and it is impossible not to hope that it will
travels 
ultimately better the condition every part
 the human race
one the happiest families i have seen
was that a poor sailor settled on the
shores the bay biscay i was once
landed at the small seaport town where they
dwelt theirs was a small cottage covered
with vines from which hung at the time 
my visit huge bunches grapes it was
during the peninsular war that i was compelled
to seek a landingplace on the stormy and
rugged coast calabria the sailor who
had taken charge me from an english ship
 war was at first an object no small
anxiety to me for i had a large sum money
in my possession he was a perfect stranger
and i wholly in his power his frank and
obvious honesty however soon won all my
confidence and i slept under his humble
covering with less distrust than had i been
 minor morals
beneath a palace roof he brought me the
white bread for which spain is celebrated
and large bunches fragrant muscadel grapes
the best bed was made up for my reposing
place and when i slept i was recommended
to the care the virgin whom an earthenware
image was suspended with gay ribbons
above my pillow yet those were terrible
times for war had ravaged the country and
there was on every side the track devastation
one day tine french troops another
day the spanish guerillas set fire to the most
ancient and remarkable edifices the land
whole villages were depopulated and it has
sometimes happened to me to arrive in deserted
streets and to find all the houses unroofed
and half them wholly destroyed
scenes horror recorded deeds horror
foreign invasion and civil war had each in
turn made spain a field blood the chas

cities the human character were likely to
be invaded if not destroyed by those sufferings
which were exhibited day by day but
even among those who suffered most there
were many who retained their kind and hospitable
feelings i well remember when i left
the cottage the spanish sailor that he provided
for me two stout young women who
carried my luggage in perfect safety over the
mountains on foot and deposited it in the
town to which i was bound it was not easy
to travel in safety but a long day's journey
brought them and me to the capital the
province he would accept no pecuniary
recompense he seemed to consider himself
responsible for my safety and well might
his spontaneous and unsought courtesies deeply
effect my mind do you want nothing 
i inquired on leaving him i want nothing
i will take nothing the virgin guide you
on your way 
the sheriff mekka
the children took the earliest opportunity
 finding their papa disengaged in order
to remind him that he had said he would let
them hear about egypt and palestine and
turkey and greece and other remote regions
 and tell us about those beautiful mahometan
countries and all the people exclaimed edith
but was not mahomet a wicked imposter
papa inquired arthur and do not the
mahometan call christians dogs and treat
them with much scorn and illwill 
it has been truly and wisely said replied
mr howard that there is a soul goodness
in things evil and the false religions that
have made so much progress in the world
the sheriff mekka 
never could have succeeded but for the mingling
 truths with their errors virtues
with their defects and bright points contrasted
with their darkness
are there not many good men among
mussulmanss asked edith
and even among pagans added arthur
it is not likely that the divine being
should have given to any portion his
creatures a monopoly excellence or that
he should have left a part the race 
man without a capacity for virtue and happiness
and i have often found persons
among the mussulmanss whom christians
might well have been proud men hospitable
beneficent and tolerant in the highest degree
i remember an instance which i will mention
to you as showing how much even the love
 truth may exist in the mind a mahometan
when travelling in egypt i got into a cons
minor morals
traverse with a turkish friend as to the
superiority the christian over the mahometan
religion he had more than once
told me it was a subject on which he did
not object to talk with me though he
and mahometan generally avoided all discussions
with christians who began by treating
their prophet with scorn and their holy 
with irreverence you may think mahomet
not to have been a prophet but you always
allow him to have been a wonderful man 
you may not admit that our koran is divinely
inspired but you acknowledge it has passages
 great poetical beauty that some its
descriptions god are eloquent and elevated
and that you have often turned over its
pages with pleasure and sometimes with improvement
well now i will tell you what
i think your religion and your christian
prophet for you know the mussulmanss allow
the sheriff mekka 
jesus christ whom they call issa to have
been a prophet i would willingly make
issa the arbiter between you and me i
would tell him where i was born how i was
taught what passed in my mind and ask
him whether i could be other than what i
am a conscientious mussulman nay more 
if you think there is no road to future happiness
but that in which you walk and that
the road in which i am walking leads to everlasting
perdition i should be willing that issa
himself should decide on my future condition
i would say to him i am travelling by one
path and endeavouring to get into paradise 
and my christian opponent is travelling by another
sure i am that he would stretch out his
hand to both us and help us on our way 
and acknowledge that one the faithful
moslems might be entitled to his favours
 minor morals
equally with his own followers i felt the
words the turk were a noble testimony
to genuine christianity the religion charity
and rejoiced to hope and to believe he had
not mistaken the character the founder 
our faith
i think i have observed papa that those
who have travelled generally speak with more
kindness persons different opinions than
those who have never left their country
said george
no doubt it is one the advantages 
travel that it destroys petty prejudices and
makes us better acquainted with the reality
 things by travel we are taught that other
countries as well as our own have much to
recommend them and their inhabitants have
often qualities to love and to honour
but tell me if travelling teach us to
the sheriff mekka 
love other countries more does it not also
make us love our own country less asked
edith
by no means it is on the contrary
on returning home from foreign lands that
the love our fatherland burns strongest in
the bosom but i will tell you another story
 a mussulman which will interest you
because the subject it is a very remarkable
man
pray do exclaimed all the children
i heard the early history the late
sheriff mekka from mahomet ali pasha
himself he was one the direct descendants
 mahomet and the head one the
most distinguished tribes the desert the
tribe on which more than any other
has sought to preserve all its patriarchal
usages and to keep itself pure from what
they call the contamination towns the
 minor morals
wilderness is their home and though many
 the tribe are called to hold office in the
holy city they invariably send their children
into the desert to preserve them from the
effeminate influence those who live
within walls the sheriff is a man a
tall and imposing presence his eye bright
and fierce as a lynx's his skin perfectly black
his movements rapid but easy and his
whole bearing impressive and stately he
had much distinguished himself in various
military encounters had received fourteen or
fifteen wounds and was considered in a word
as the most illustrious warrior the hedjaz
on the application the pasha egypt
to the sultan turkey the sheriffdom 
the holy city the highest arabian dignity
was conferred upon him but as his new
office brought new influence he became an
object apprehension to mahomet ali who
the sheriff mekka 
found it necessary to secure his person by
an ingenious stratagem on occasion some
festivity lie ordered one his captains in
the red sea to invite the sheriff and his
attendants to a repast on board his vessel
which was then laying at edda the sheriff
came with his people and when they were
all on board and engaged in the enjoyments
 the table the anchor was raised the
vessel set sail and the sheriff and his friends
were delivered over to the governor suez
who escorted them safely to cairo where i
had the pleasure making the sheriff's
acquaintance and found him surrounded if
not with the splendours independence with
much the pomp and parade oriental
life
the sheriff is still living at cairo and
i went with the english consulgeneral to
pay him an evening visit the sun had
 minor morals
but just set and we found him engaged
with about forty persons in acts devotion
they were repeating the allah ilia allah 
mahomet resoul allah and bending
their foreheads to the dust in frequent prostrations
 while on rising they sung religious
hymns to the sound the pipe and tabor
we remained at a distance until the service
was over we then approached and were
received with great courtesy and requested
to take our seats next to the sheriff on the
divan which he occupied the corner his
son an intelligent lad about ten or twelve
years old sat on his right hand the most
distinguished the guests took their places
more or less remote on the divan according
to their ranks and about thirty servants
 there is no god but god and mahomet is
god's prophet

the sheriff mekka 
osmanlis egyptians negro slaves and
eunuchs clad in a great variety costume
for the most part richly ornamented stood
in a semicircle about the divan
handsome pipes coffee and sherbet according
to the oriental custom were introduced
and the conversation began to be very
interesting and animated as it became more
general i observed that one the guests
took a more prominent part than the rest
and that diis opinions had much weight with
the company he had been a great traveller
had visited calcutta and many parts british
india and he told the sheriff that there
were some millions faithful mussulmanss
in that part the world upon which we
said that it was the policy as it was the
duty the british government to protect
them in the full enjoyment their religious
opinions and the exercise their religious
vol iii c
 minor morals
rites the sheriff ordered his scribe to be
sent for and to seat himself on the divan
he came bearing in his sash an inkstand
girdled with diamonds from which he took a
beautifully decorated reed and the sheriff
while his eye glistened with delight directed
him to record all that had been said
respecting british india we know something
 hindostan he added it supplies
mekka with almost all the articles we consume
we see a great many pilgrims from that
country your government does not interfere
with them that is just that is right
he made many inquiries about europe
was there not a very great warrior there
some years ago you mean napoleon
buonaparte he had not heard his name
he said but had heard his deeds and
was he not conquered and sent away to die
in exile he was but if he was so
the sheriff mekka 
great a warrior how came lie to be conquered 
 because there was a greater warrior tian
lie and what was that other warrior's
name wellington put that down put
that down said the sheriff to the scribe
 and what is the name your king 
 we have no king we have a queen 
what a woman put that down scribe 
put that down and what is your queen's
name victoria alexandrina and what
is the meaning her name victoria is
your nasal a name given to celebrate the
great victory the great warrior we were
speaking write that scribe but alexandrine
what is the meaning that upon
which we pointed out the relationship between
the royal family england and the imperial
family russia and that it was in honour
 an emperor the north that the name
 alexandrina was given but arabs have
 minor morals
no notions any latitude in namegiving
and we did not succeed in making the
reasons clear to the sheriff it was too
remote an association cause and effect 
and he said quietly i do not understand
this but he did not say to the scribe put
that down
 but do your people ever see your
queen does she unveil her face indeed
she does and a very pretty face it is 
 mashallah put it down scribe we
had just been reading in the papers an
account the city festival in honour the
queen and described it to the astonished
sheriff as well as we could the unveiled
queen the unveiled ladies the court the
ceremonials the feasting the procession the
speechifying mashallah mashallah i
must believe it because you say it put it
down scribe put it all down
the sheriff mekka 
the children were amused with mr howard's
story and had quite forgotten the
conversation that led to it little edith sat
thrilling with pleasure in her chair she
was so delighted she clapped her hands 
but at last cried out go on go on papa 
the mussulman traveller said a few words
to the sheriff and the sheriff inquired 
us whether it was true that in europe the
sea rose and the sea fell at stated seasons
as we course answered in the affirmative
inquire said the traveller what is the
cause the rise and fall the sea the
scribe was directed to be attentive and we
answered that it had been observed to follow
the changes the moon but that our wise
men had not been able to explain the theory
 the tides i have another question to
ask which is to me a mystery tell me
why that which is secreted from the eyes
 minor morals
is salt from the mouth is sweet and from
the ears is bitter we child only refer
to the wonderful organization the human
frame and to the adaptation all its parts
to the purposes for which they were destined
but we could not explain the cause it is
a mystery to you who are christians and
to us who are mahometan it is a mystery
to all yes said one the company 
but may not christians and mahometan
agree in this that the god wiio made the seato
rise and fall and who gave those different
characters to the secretions the head 
man may we not all say that he is the
father us all and that he is most great
most wise and most good wallah tayib 
exclaimed the sheriff and tayib that
is well was echoed by every voice and
resounded through the room never was i
more delighted or more affected this was
the sheriff mekka 
something like a triumph religious truth
subduing in that moment honest enthusiasm
every thought uncharitableness
the nile
are not the egyptians very proud their
country asked george
the love country answered mr howard
 is one the strongest human
passions but it has been thought to exist
less strongly in flat than in mountainous
lands among the egyptians the attachment
is less to the soil than to the river the
river nile which is in their eyes as it was
in the eyes their forefathers a sort 
divinity they speak their nile with
the intensity personal affections it is their
daily benefactor to it they owe their wealth
be that wealth great or small the verdure
the nile 
 their fields their food their drink their
clothing for it produces the vegetables and
the fish they eat it gives the water with
which they quench their thirst and cook
their victuals it causes the cotton tree to
grow which they make their garments 
it supplies their flocks and herds there is
not a woman on its banks who from the
time at which she first is able to carry a
pitcher on her head or bear one in her
hand does not daily replenish it in the
sacred and venerable stream its praise passes
into their proverbs into their daily talk i
remember travelling to the bahr el youssoufi
and having alighted i gave my horse to a
poor fellah woman when on remounting
 put a small coin into her hand she said
may allah bless thee as he blessed the
course the nile a hundred times i
have been told in egypt you will return
c 
 minor morals
hither no one ever drank the waters 
the nile without being irresistibly impelled
to drink them again and the water though
not clear is delicious and healthful the
egyptian levantines have a saying that
what champagne is to other wines is the
nile to other waters and there is also an
arabian proverb had mahomet drank the
waters the nile he would have stayed on
earth and not have allowed himself to be
conveyed to paradise 
is there much sailing on the nile papa 
will you tell us what sorts boats are
used said edith
there are between five and six thousand
boats constantly in movement on the two
branches the nile the rosetta and damietta
branches and from the point their union
up to essouan there is the first cataract
as it is called but it is not a cataract it is
the nile 
merely a rapid where the waters rush through
the granite rocks having however channels
so large that during many months the
year the boats can be hauled through and
proceed to wadi haifa the second cataract
boats on the nile are all sizes from
the smallest punt to terms which will convey
 tons goods they are for the most
part coarse construction carrying enormously
large triangular sails and are frequently
overturned by the sudden gusts on
the river it has happened to me to be
sailing quietly up one bank the nile
and all a sudden without any notice to
find my boat whirled away and left high
and dry on the opposite side accidents
are perpetually occurring so often that
they excite little interest and the arabs
will seldom interfere to succour the wrecked
 minor morals
in december t i was sailing up the nile
in one the pacha's boats and we saw in
the middle the stream keel upwards an
overturned vessel on whose sides were a
pilgrim and three or four other persons who
stretched out their hands towards us as we
passed and cried imploringly for aid our
sailors would not listen either to our requests
or to our menaces requiring them to stop
they answered there were other teats behind 
and so there were two boats with english
travellers who appealed to like ourselves did
all they could to induce their arab sailors to help
the shipwrecked people but it was all in vain
they had a fine wind they said and would not
be delayed besides why did not they swim 
though then the surface the nile was
rough as the stormy ocean and he must have
been a good swimmer indeed who would have
the nile 
trusted its waves the arabs might have
done so for they are almost amphibious but
the poor pilgrim 
and what became the poor pilgrim
papa asked edith
why being invested with some authority
we applied to the governor the next town
we reached i think it was manfalout and
he despatched a boat in order to save the
shipwrecked people they had been able to
cling to the keel the vessel till succour
arrived and they were brought safe to shore
except one whom the waves had washed
away from the vessel
is not manfalout the place where travellers
begin to see crocodiles on the nile 
inquired george between whom and his papa
the following conversation took place 
yes but they sometimes come lower
 minor morals
down however it is only above manfalout
that they are seen in great numbers
 in great numbers papa how many
have you seen at once 
perhaps forty or fifty basking in the
sun i once counted fourteen close together
on a very small sandbank in the middle 
the nile
 do they fly from travellers 
always when they are awake
and is there any truth in the story that
they have a little bird to attend them and
give them notice danger 
there is a bird on the nile found in
great numbers in the places most frequented
by the crocodile called by the arabs the
ziczac and by europeans the monitor which
always rises with a sharp noise somewhat
like its arabic name and which is the bird
the nile 
supposed to be the crocodile's guardian the
story had its origin probably in the simultaneous
flight the bird and the crocodile
on the approach danger an intelligent
english traveller however told me that he
had himself seen the monitor give notice to
the crocodile the arrival travellers
does the crocodile often attack travellers

o no it is really a timid animal feeding
principally on fish and flying the neighbourhood
 man but if it can attack a
human being without danger it will not hesitate
to do so it is not an unfrequent
thing when a crocodile has been killed to
find bracelets or other ornaments undigested
in its bowels
are they easily caught 
not easily but there are some the
arabs who are very dextrous in the pursuit
 minor morals
and capture the crocodile the governor
 girgeh told me a peasant who had
killed in one day no less than seventeen
large crocodiles he was in the habit 
presenting himself to the crocodile in the
water with a heavy dagger in his hand and
 stabbing the animal in the mouth or
throat but the crocodile is far more agile
than he is generally supposed to be and
turns round with great ease considering his
unwieldy size
do they live to a great age 
 frequently in fact even their persons
get distinctly known and at farshiout
i heard an immense old crocodile with
whom all the fellahs were acquainted and
had been so for two or three generations
he had a great reputation for cunning nobody
having been able to get near enough to hurt
him and the crocodile destroyers had quite

for we would fain be told
how old you are in truth
you must be very old 
a century we should guess
you surely are not less
yes eighteen hundred years
and more have on me roll'd 
i feel the weight age

i am the wandering jew
the wandering jew i tread
wearied from clime to clime
i roam round the world 
tis now the fifth sad time
while generations die
i live o hapless i
i cross the stormy seas
the rivers and the rills
the wastes the wilds the woods

i've travelled europe o'er

i've seen the warriors fall

but sabre shell or shot
my misery ended not
i've seen america

i've watched the frightful march
 man's mortality
but i can find no ease
from death or plaguedisease
and nought can i possess 
nor house nor land nor gold
two pennies in my purse
and then my all is told
wandering from door to door 
so much but never more
we did not believe the tale
we thought it was a lie
as other lies that come
to cheat credulity 
but now we see tis true 
forgive us wandering jew 
but tell us tell us what
your grievous crime could be
so visited by god
with such great misery 
treatment animals in the east 
great surely was the offence
that brought such recompense
it was my hardihood
my recklessness and sin 
mercy if i could
but wash my conscience clean 
my sin my shame is this 
 used my lord amiss
i met him with his cross
on calvary's weary hill
he said with gentle smile
i see him smiling still
here let the saviour rest 
he's weary and distrest
but cold and brutal i
said culprit no i be gone
and trouble not my door
move on i say move on
thy presence wearies me
so off so off with thee
he turned on me his eye
a cloud came o'er his brow
and answered with a sigh
thou shalt move on yes thou 
 minor morals
a thousand thousand years
till judgment day appears
that very day i left
my home and from that day
i wander through the world
my weary weary way 
no rest no sleep i know 
by day by night tis so
i cannot wait farewell 
i thank your courtesy
but while i wait a hell
 torment presses me 
i cannot sit nor stay
but must away away 
the children were much pleased with the
ballad and while they expressed great horror
at the jew's brutality they all agreed
that the infliction was too severe and not
consistent with his character who taught us
to forgive even our enemies and who asked
pardon not punishment for those who persecuted
him
treatment animals in the east 
but the subject is a fine one for poetry

has been treated by a true poet stranger

are far inferior to the original french

to him that's weary gracious heaven

is granted i am whirl'd away 
ever ever
on the soft grass in flowerets drest
near the fresh stream beneath the tree
if from my misers i would rest
the whirlwind howls and summons me
o why should angry heaven deny
one moment one sweet repose 
for were the grave eternity
it would not rest me from my woes 
ever ever
those laughing girls those sporting boys
remind me mine own at play 
my heart would revel in their joys 
the whirlwind hurries me away

r 
vampires
when will you tell us papa some more
stories about fairies or ghosts for a little
variety you know is so pleasing said
edith to mr howard as the time for their
evening conversation approached
why wee will take the opinion the
majority edith replied her father what
says mamma 
o mamma exclaimed one the boys
i am sure mamma will let us support edith's
motion today and papa will give us something
supernatural
so be it children said mrs howard
vampires 
consentingly and we will be unanimous in
our petitions to papa
agreed responded mr howard and
i think i will give you some account the
vampires which i dare say you have
often heard and no oriental superstition
is more general or more disgusting than the
belief in shades or vampires a dead body
will become a vampire it is said if for the
first week after death it is exposed to the
action the sun's rays and if forty days
are allowed to pass without the removal 
the corpse from such a situation it is no
longer to be found among the dead but
receives its horrible mission to torment and
to alarm the living
some the proceedings the vampires
are more mischievous than wicked they
pour vinegar into wine mix honey and meal
together salt with sugar oil with butter but
 minor morals
they also beat and sometimes are said to
murder their old acquaintances they appear
either in the character they had while alive
or assume the shape an animal or even
wander about invisible upon the earth
so little doubt attaches to the existence
 vampires that the cadi a district is
frequently applied to for an islam or authority
to enable a chadedgi or vampirdgi
vampirehunter to visit burialplaces to
examine graves and to take any other measures
to discover and to defeat the machinations 
vampires these men profess to be gifted
by means certain herbs with the power
 tracking a vampire even when he is invisible
to others they act gratuitously
refusing all recompense but are bound not
to communicate their unknown secrets to any
but their hereditary descendants the opinion
generally maintained is that the chadedgi are
vampires 
themselves descended from vampires on the
paternal side and it is an undoubted fact
that in the districts where the vampires are
most common the vampirdgis are to be found
in the greatest numbers the remedy grows
with the growth the evil
having obtained then authority from
the cadi the vampirdgi sets out on a visit
to all the tombs in the neighbourhood and
sometimes undertakes a journey many
leagues he discovers by arts unknown the
tomb the vampire and on the following
saturday for it is only on saturday that
the vampires are at home the vampirdgi
the local authorities and crowds people
hasten to the place which is surrounded by
men on horseback each with a drawn sabre
in his hand nobody can tell why there
are so many guards but so it is and under
the direction the vampirdgi the grave is
 minor morals
opened and the body is always discovered 
the skin peeled ois the muscles fresh and
red but swelled the hair and beard if it bethe
corpse a man considerably lengthened
there is no disagreeable odour but the smell
is solely that newlyuncovered earth remember
this is the account given by the
people themselves the spectators all retire
to some distance while the chadedgi drives
a pointed stake through the heart the
corpse from whence there is always an emission
 blood the crowd then approach a
funeral pile is prepared and the body with
the stake is burnt till they are both wholly
consumed and the ashes being deposited in
the grave the vampire can molest his neighbours
no more the proceedings vary somewhat
in different parts the east those i
have described are exactly such as take place
in the turkish provinces on the danube
vampires ill
it is not an uncommon thing for a
governor at the request a district to
order the burialplace to be changed when
it is suspected being favourable to the
creation vampires old ali pacha 
tannin issued several such decrees and i
have known instances where the inhabitants
 whole villages have left their houses and
passed the night in the fields when it was
supposed a vampire had got into their
habitations
at sees in macedonia there was a
vampire which created great disturbance he
often visited the house in which he had dwelt
when alive and amused himself by pelting
the persons he found in it with pigeon's
dung one day when there was a large
company a daring young man bid defiance
to the vampire told him to show himself
and challenged him to single combat he
 minor morals
was answered by a shower pigeon's dung
upon which he drew a pistol from his belt
and fired at the spot whence the shower
proceeded but great was everybody's astonishment
when instead going directly to
the object the ball stopped in the middle 
the room and fell perpendicularly down upon
the floor immediately quantities dirt were
hurled at the persons who were present and
they were obliged to fly from the place
a vampirdgi was immediately sent for
and he came accompanied by a crowd 
people placing himself in the middle 
the court he wrote an inscription on a piece
 paper which he threw into the air where
it continued describing circles for more thana
quarter an hour when it fell perpendicularly
to the ground the chadedgi immediately
drove a staff with a sharp iron
point through the paper and on lifting it
vampires 
up a small frog was seen pierced through
by the iron a fire had been before kindled
and in the midst the fire he placed the
stair the paper and the frog and when all
were consumed the ashes were collected taken
to the churchyard and buried and the
village was never afterwards disturbed by the
vampire
a district celebrated for its number 
vampires is that sarigueul in the neighbourhood
 japonica any one who likes
to visit that part macedonia might fill a
volume with the stories he could collect
that which i am about to relate was related
by the governor and verified by the mufti
 modena who said that fifteen hundred
persons were willing to swear to the truth
 the statement
in the village embord there died
some years ago a greek peasant the name
 minor morals
 marco loutclie he left a widow and
two daughters aged eight and ten years
one evening about three months after his
death while the woman and her children were
employed in spinning flax by lamplight
marco appeared the door had not been
opened and they were naturally alarmed by
the presence a man whom they at first
supposed to be a robber but their alarm was
increased tenfold when they perceived that their
visitor was one the dead that he was her
husband and their father but he spoke to
them in gentle tones declared he would do
them no harm that his visit was one 
affection and that with their consent he
proposed to pass every night in their company
he said he should not come emptyhanded
in future and in fact at his next visit he
brought them each a pair loose trowsers
such as are worn by oriental women every
vampires 
evening something was added to their wardrobe
or to their stock culinary vare and
household furniture while in the village 
encore and the neighbouring villages nothing
was heard but the robberies 
garments chairs tables pots and pans and
nobody could discover the thief not a word
was said by the woman about their growing
possessions for in fact the vampire had
menaced them with dreadful vengeance if
they ever opened their lips on the subject
in other particulars the conduct the vampire
was reprehensible and he was fond talking
with and caressing the girls after about a
month he had made himself quite at home
in the house where he passed all his nights
but departed at the dawn day when his
widow alarmed lest her conduct should be
deemed sinful determined to consult the papa
greek priest the parish and to ask his
 minor morals
counsel in so very embarrassing a state 
things the papa recommended her to be
prudent to avoid any quarrel but to endeavour
to worm out from the vampire where
he passed his time from sunrise to sunset 
as it would not be possible to destroy him
in the churchyard he having been dead more
than forty days he even recommended her
to welcome him to speak him and act
towards him with all kindness and affection
and to employ every winning art in order
to ascertain where he went when he deserted
her in the morning the widow managed
it all with so much dexterity that after a
few days she was able to communicate to the
priest that her husband passed his days in
the decayed trunk a chestnuttree one 
seven or eight which grew at a short distance
from the village on the northeast side a
communication was therefore made to the
vampires 
local authorities and the usual permission was
given on the following saturday the people
collected and surrounded the trees but as
none them were to appearance hollow it
was necessary to climb them and on the top
 one the trunks where it divided itself
into branches a large hole was discovered
and in that hole a dead body standing erect
exhaling no disagreeable odour whatever the
ceremonies which have been described took
place the tree was cut down and burnt
with the corpse
a proclamation was issued throughout the
district that those who had lost anything
should apply to the turkish commander
who would restore their property to them
he said that a great many people demanded
things they had never lost and that the
most violent disputes took place between the
various claimants but he averred the exact
 minor morals
truth the facts and added that the widow
declared before the competent tribunal that
the vampire was cold as death and that his
touch was perfectly icy
is it not very likely papa that the
widow was a receiver stolen goods and
that on detection she invented the story 
the vampire said george
that may well be answered mr howard 
for i believe in nine cases out ten the
belief in ghosts genii and vampires is used
in the east by clever rogues as a means 
carrying on and concealing their fraudulent
doings
mahomet all
 papa you have seen much mahomet
ali pacha will you tell us something about
him where was he born was arthur's
request to mr howard when next they all
met together
he was born at camilla in roumelia was
his father's answer and he told me he was
the youngest sixteen children he was
much indulged by his father and mother and
was a great favourite his brothers and sisters
he once said to me do not wonder if i am
sometimes impatient and want to have my own
way i was never used to contradiction i
have scarcely ever known misfortune i was
 minor morals
born under a smiling star and that star has
smiled upon me all my life through 
but has not mahomet ali committed a
great many cruel deeds did he not invite
all the mamelukess to a festival and cause
them to be murdered inquired george
and i have heard added arthur that
one them sprung with his fine arab
horse over the battlements the high citadel
 cairo and so saved his life
what you have heard is true said mr
howard and all that mahomet ali or his
friends urge for his justification is that the
mamelukess were plotting against him and
would have destroyed him had he not destroyed
them
what is meant by a mameluke papa 
asked edith
a mameluke my dear means a slave
the mameluke in the east is a white
i
mahomet all 
person who was originally bought by a turkish
master the mamelukess come from circassia
and georgia the morea and other
parts the ottoman empire sometimes
they are sold by their parents sometimes
they are taken in war and there are cases
in which they have become voluntary slaves
 a mussulman master joseph when he
was sold by his brethren in syria to the
midianite merchants was nothing but a mameluke
 and he rose to power in egypt
under pharaoh as hundreds have risen who
are now in the pacha's service commanding
his fleets and armies and occupying the very
highest posts about his person and in his
government a mameluke slave becomes a
part his master's family is fed and clothed
by him and frequently gives evidence 
extraordinary attachment and devotion to
advance him in life is one the great
vol iii g
 minor morals
objects his master's policy usually when
a mameluke slave gets to a marriageable
age a wife is found for him and he is
sometimes established independently his
owner the egyptians who have been
sent to be instructed in europe many were
purchased in their boyhood by the pacha
and his son it is seldom they know anything
 their parentage and i have often taken occasion
to inquire how far the feelings 
affection which children experience towards
their parents could be transferred to strangers
and to masters
did you ever hear a mameluke tell the
story his being kidnapped and his
sufferings and wdiat he felt when he was
torn from his home asked edith
yes i once got a bey who had acquired
distinction in the pacha's army to
relate to me what he recollected the
mahomet all 
history his childhood and what he said
was this the earliest thing i can remember
is a great mountain on the side
 which were many houses and at its foot
a river where a lady used to take me to
walk i do not know how old i was i
have forgotten even the language i used to
speak but i remember we were several
boys and girls in the house brothers and
sisters and we used to play together on a
green hill one day i heard that our father
had been quarrelling with a relation i had
seen him go out in the morning with his
arms and he never returned again i have
a confused recollection that we were all my
mother my brothers and my sisters carried
away by persons whose faces i had never
before seen arid we were conveyed to tambour
all this has left no stronger impressions
on my mind than if i had dreamt it
 minor morals
so completely have oilier events erased it
from my memory i know that i am a
circassian for a few circassian words are
still left in my mind but the name the
spot where i was born or that my family
 even the faces my brothers and sisters
i have now no idea yet i have endeavoured
again and again to hear something
 my early fate and that my father
i have described to every circassian mameluke
i have met with all that i know 
my birthplace and my family and i have
listened to their stories in return and i
have often fancied that their mountain was
my mountain their river my river and their
village my village had they never heard
a story resembling mine indeed such
stories are so common they are an everyday's
tale there was nothing peculiar in
my fate and then my brother from
mahomet all 
whom i was separated as soon as we reached
constantinople i to be received into a noble
family to be instructed in all the learning
 the east to be taught the profoundest
polemics islamism to be pushed forward
into the highest seats but my brother 
he must have been older by a year or two
than i his riper memory would fill uphe
blanks mine he would help me now their
i am rich and powerful to discover to revisit
and to bless the little village in which we
were born how often has my heart yearned
when holding converse with a circassian mameluke
 how often has it occurred to me
perhaps he even he is my brother yet
never but once never but once did i feel
any light was thrown on my earlier days
and that was in upper egypt where i met
with a circassian hadji on a pilgrimage to
the holy cities with him i talked 
 minor morals
the theme so dear to my heart to him i
described all i knew my native land
and he exclaimed i know the place i
know it well but i never heard your
family he told me i might be certain
he would busy himself about my concerns
when he returned from mekka he swore
by the prophet that i should hear i made
him repeat his oath by all that is holiest
not a word have i heard perhaps he
perished in the desert perhaps he has never
returned to circassia perhaps he has returned
and has learnt nothing perhaps
after a lapse thirty years there was nothing
to learn i have heard from our circassian
women that people know little one another
in that country that busied in perpetual
misunderstandings and in petty warfare every
family has too many cares its own to be
occupied with the cares and concerns 
mahomet all 
others still a voice within me is perpetually
crying you will find your brother
you will return to your native village 
you will see again the mountain the river
and the green hill and when the bey
had said this he hung down his head in
silence and raised it in smiles when i said
you will yet find your brother 
but we have forgotten mahomet all
while talking one his beys i should
tell you that mahomet ali was fortysix
years old before he had learned either to
read or to write this he told me himself
i have heard that he was taught by his
favourite wife but he is fond reading
now and one day when i entered his
divan unannounced i found him quite alone
with his spectacles on reading a turkish
volume which he was much enjoying while
a considerable pile books were by his
 minor morals
side it is a pleasant relief lie said from
public business i was reading some amusing
turkish stories probably the arabian
nights and now let us talk what have
you to tell me there is a great deal 
sagacity in mahomet all's conversation particularly
when he knows or discovers as he
usually does the sort information which
his visitor is most able to give he discourses
with engineers about mechanical improvements
 with military men on the art
 war with seaofficers on shipbuilding
and naval manoeuvres with travellers on
the countries they have visited with politicians
on public affairs he very willingly
talks foreign countries and princes and
statesmen and is in the habit mingling in
the conversation all sorts anecdotes about
himself and the events connected with his
history his phrases are often poetical and
mahomet alt 
he like most orientals frequently introduce
proverbs and imagery i heard him once
say speaking the agriculture egypt
when i came to this country i only
scratched it with a pin i have now succeeded
in cultivating it with a hoe but
soon i will have a plough passing over the
whole land you asked me george if he
were not a cruel prince and that he certainly
is not for many a generous deed has
he done and seldom will it be found that
the reign a turkish sovereign is so little
stained with blood
we like to hear acts clemency
said one the children tell us mahomet
all's
when i was at cairo a number levantine
merchants had got deeply and i
fear dishonestly in debt to the pacha pay

 minor morals
ment lead been urged in every possible way
but in vain at last the pacha got impatient
for the amount was large exceeding
 sterling and he directed them to be
seized sent to the galleys for life and all
their property to be confiscated it happened
that an englishman distinction and myself
were applied to by their distressed
families to intercede with the pacha and to
implore mercy less on account the imprudent
debtors than their numerous families
we urged the excess punishment
with reference to the offence falling upon
the innocent more heavily than on the guilty
we talked the gentle quality mercy 
blessing the giver as much as the receiver 
and the old man's heart was touched and
he forgave the debtors
i have heard you say that mahomet ali
mahomet alt 
is a very interesting person in his own
family now let us all know something 
his private character said mrs howard
i do not deny answered mr howard
that i feel a great interest in mahomet
ali and the more so because i have had
the advantage seeing him with his children
and grandchildren around him and 
talking with him about domestic matters
in the east it is very difficult to learn
much about the private concerns any
turk and still less those men high
station mahomet ali's great pride is ibrahim
pacha a victorious leader is always an
object admiration among mussulmanss and
ibrahim pacha's career has been one brilliant
military success his father is fond 
talking his firstborn son and intended successor
i did not know him he said i
had not an unbounded confidence in him for
 minor morals
many many years no not till ms beard
was almost as long as my own and even
changing its colour said the pacha to me
but now i can thoroughly trust him on
the part ibrahim pacha though in rank
above his father for the pacha the holy
cities is the first pacha the ottoman empire
there is always the utmost deference
to mahomet all's will in the most difficult
circumstances his life he has always
referred to his renowned sire for advice
and whenever he has been pressed by the
representatives the great powders europe
he has invariably answered that he should
abide by the instructions he received from
his father the sons mahomet ali
toussoun the second was long the favourite
he was a prince a generous not to say
extravagant disposition and when on one
occasion he was reproached by his father for
mahomet all 
his prodigality he answered it may be
well for you to be economical who were not
born what you are but i am the son 
mahomet ali pacha and the son a pacha
must be liberal his father smiled the
answer flattered his sense dignity and he
upbraided toussoun no more not long after
toussoun died the plague a third son
snail was murdered by the blacks in senna
the hut in which he was being surrounded
by brushwood set on fire and he
perished in the flames
had they no motive the blacks had he
done nothing to deserve so cruel a fate 
inquired edith
he had invaded their country and awakened
their animosity and looking on him as
an intruder they thus satiated their revenge
and what happened in consequence 
asked george
 minor morals
the slieikli or leader at sliendy where
the deed was committed was afterwards
seized and all the inhabitants who were
supposed to have taken any part in the
assassination were put to death
how shocking exclaimed edith
war horrible as it everywhere is in
barbarous countries is accompanied by horrors
which happily in our days and among civilized
nations have been modified or wholly
put an to but even now where it rages
in the east deeds are frequently done which
one cannot think without shuddering
vengeance acts with all its ferocity and to
torture as well as to destroy an enemy is
deemed the right as it is the not unfrequent
usage mutilations the most frightful character
are still sanctioned and practised in
the ancient monuments egypt the arrival
 immense quantities human ears is demahomet
all 
picked and in one the temples the king
is represented watching the turning over 
a large heap ears while the scribe is recording
their numbers as they are reported
by persons employed in counting them to
this day such inhuman presents are often sent
to the sultan and welcomed as appropriate
gifts the heads rebellious chieftains are
accompanied by the ears their obscurer
followers who in hundreds cases have
been forced to take part in insurrections
from which they willingly would have kept
aloof in the last war with the druses 
the hauoran in syria the egyptian prisoners
who fell into their hands were sawed
in pieces while yet alive i speak such
things unwillingly my children but i have
two objects i wish you to know at what a
frightful cost military reputations are often
purchased i wish you to know what war is
 minor morals
in order that you may hate it and that
hating war you may cherish the spirit 
peace seek peace on all occasions avoid
those passions whose unrestrained outbreak
leads to such vice and such misery and especially
that you should feel what a privilege
what a blessing it is to have been born christians
and to have had your lot thrown upon
days and among people who though they
retain somewhat the warlike barbarisms and
tendencies past ages and distant realms
have undoubtedly made no small progress in
the career humanity and now i will again
speak mahomet ali and his family
 i have been very happy in my children
he said to me one day there is not one 
them who does not treat me with the utmost
deference and respect except he added
laughing outright that little fellow the last
and the least all mahomet ak
mahomet alt 
 he was then a boy five or six years
old called by lies father's name the son 
his old age his benjamin his best beloved
 i see how it is i said your highness
spoils the boy you encourage the little
rogue mahomet ali laughed again it was
an acknowledgment a little paternal weakness

not long after i was in the palace 
shoubra it was on a friday the mussulman
sabbath when the pacha is in the habit 
receiving all his family
i found him in the centre his divan
he was surrounded by all his sons and grandsons
who were then residing at cairo he
had been listening to the accounts their
studies their amusements and their employments
abbas pacha the eldest son 
toussoun pacha sat next his grandfather
and the rest the family were seated on
 minor morals
chairs according to their ranks and ages
after some conversation mahomet ali told
his descendants that they might now withdraw
one after another they rose knelt
before him kissed the hem his garment
and retired little mahomet ali came last
he was dressed in military costing with a
small goldencased scimitar dangling at his
side he advanced towards his father looked
in his face he saw the accustomed the
involuntary smile and when he was about a
yard from the pacha instead bending or
saluting him he turned on his heels and
laughingly scampered away like a yoimg
colt
 i see how it is said i to mahomet ali
the old man shook his head looked
grave for a moment another smile passed
over his countenance pekin pekin said
he in a low tone well well but i
mahomet all 
certainly did not like his highness the
worse for what i had just witnessed
children like to be talked to about children
and they like especially to have those
who are too exalted to be approachable by
themselves brought as it were into their
presence and made intelligible to their understandings
 and now good night said
mr howard and the young people withdrew
to dream about the great and the little mahomet
ail
magicians
as george and arthur were walking in the
garden one said to the other let us ask
papa if he saw the magician at cairo who
they say has so often shown absent people
to his visitors and even brought into their
company the exact likenesses the dead 
he you mean answered george who
being asked to exhibit lord nelson introduced
the image lord nelson dressed like
a naval officer and having lost one his
arms
that was indeed very strange we will
inquire papa how it can be explained
and after tea was over and the teamagicians

tiling's removed george said to mr howard
arthur and i were talking today about
the magician cairo whom we have
heard so much and we determined to ask
you whether you had seen him and whether
you can explain how he managed to convince
his visitors that he was able to summon
the absent and the dead into his presence
i believe my boys answered mr howard
 that the magician would not have
much success if his auditors understood arabic
thoroughly if they were not themselves
credulous and if the professed sorcerer did
not so put his questions as to enable him to
elicit the answer he wishes to obtain i did
not see him at cairo because he has been so
much exposed cf late and his failures have
been so repeated that the interest felt in
his imposture has died away you know he
never practises except on young people and
 minor morals
usually the ignorant and superstitious young
arabs who are called in from the streets
you remember after having performed his
incantations he professes to show the reflection
 the persons whom it is wished to see
in a small quantity ink which he pours
into the hand the young person he
operates on i know a case where an intelligent
english lad was taken into the presence
 the magician and after he had made
his preparations and filled the boy's palm
with ink he asked him whether he saw anything
the boy looked and looked said
no nothing at first but at last cried
out o yes o yes i see i see something
 upon which all the company cried
out in great excitement ancr'what what
clo yousee i see said the boy i see
my ovn nose 
now i believe that the lads who o to
magicians 
the magician now merely see their own
noses or such things as they are led to
fancy they see by the leading questions
which the magicians ask i will tell you a
story however which i heard from a veracious
source and which will show you what
strong credulity may do in deceiving the
senses
a young mussulman had visited mekka
while quite a lad and had obtained in consequence
the title hadji he was only
twelve years old when he went to the holy
city in company with his father and he
said he should undoubtedly have died not
so much from fatigue as from a perpetual
sorrowing after his mother and sister whom
he passionately loved had not a pilgrim
from morocco who turned out to be a magician
come to his relief i will tell his
story in his own words
 minor morals
 my father and i left yakova our
native town for japonica on our way to the
holy city my heart sunk within me at
parting with my mother and sister but the
novelty the journey sometimes turned my
thoughts away from objects so inexpressibly
dear to me but in our passage from samonica
to alexandria when there was nothing
to engage or direct my attention every hour
not passed in sleep and many many were
my waking hours was occupied in thinking
 those i had left behind happily the
voyage only lasted six days and the great
cities alexandria and cairo so unlike
anything i had seen afforded me much amusement
and enjoyment and served for a little
time to relieve me from the grief with which
my bosom was filled but as we travelled
to coster the desire to see my mother and
my sister occupied all my mind so that
magicians 
when we reached the red sea i could contain
my feelings no longer but gave way
to the bitterest weeping at the thought that
another sea was to roll between me and those
i so tenderly loved and so earnestly desired
to see a deep melancholy overcame me
and i fell seriously ill being unable either
to eat drink or sleep i had been four
days in this state at coster when my
father received the visit a morocco pilgrim
whose acquaintance we had made at
cairo where we had inhabited the same
house seeing that my father was much out
 spirits he inquired the reason and was
told my illness and its cause which
illness was not only in itself a source 
affliction but was likely to prevent our departure
in the djedda vessels which were to
sail in a very few days the pilgrim at once
proposed to undertake my cure and to show
vol iii h
 minor morals
me my mother and my sister but as the
allowing a stranger to see a mahommedan
woman is contrary to our laws my father
made many objections fearing that if seen
by me they would be seen by the pilgrim
also but his great anxiety about his only
son and his desire to accomplish his pilgrimage
induced him to give his consent
i was taken from my bed and dressed
the pilgrim lighted a charcoal fire and
directed that i should not open my lips or
stretch out my hands to the persons who
might appear my father sat on one side 
me and our servant on the other the
pilgrim took a piece paper wrote an
inscription on it and threw it on the burning
coals uttering some words in a low tone 
and hardly was the paper consumed ere my
mother and my sister appeared in the middle
 the chamber smiling on me most sweetly
magicians 
i felt no alarm but lead great difficulty in
restraining myself from rushing into their
arms they remained there for several
minutes and not being able to resist i endeavoured
to rush forward when my father
caught me by the waist and i cried out
mother mother speak to me and at
that moment the vision disappeared the
magician scowled upon me terribly and my
father gave me a violent cuff on the ear
i should have been in a state despair but
the magician promised to repeat the incantation
the next day he was indeed my
life and i entreated him to come and dwell
with us as he only could console or save
me the next day before he began the
ceremonies he made me swear on the
koran that i would keep still which i religiously
did my health began to improve
 minor morals
he allowed me to see my mother and sister
twice after and i became perfectly well
the power superstition continued mr
howard and the universality the belief in
the presence genii mingling themselves in
mortal affairs may be traced by any inquirer
i will mention a circumstance that occurred
to a european gentleman at janina he had
visited said ahmet effendi and pipes and
coffee were being brought in when a violent
noise was heard probably from rats
under the floor what is this said the
host when one the persons present said
laughingly no doubt they are djins hardly
was the word uttered when the servant who
was bringing in the coffee his name was
islam let the tray fall shrieked loudly 
threw himself upon the traveller who was
the nearest to him all the guests and
magicians 
hid his face under the cushion the divan
his master broke into a great rage and the
traveller not being able otherwise to get rid
 islam gave him a violent blow which
flung him on the floor when he came to
himself his master ordered him to explain
his strange conduct and he said that when
a boy ten or eleven years old a woman
fell ill in his native village he was an albanian
 and medical assistance was sought
in vain a dervish who was known to
exercise authority over the djins was called
in none but children can be employed
to carry on the intercourse the magician
with the genii and islam was fixed on for
the purpose the dervish filled a basin
with water and forced islam to look into it
he found it grow larger and larger till it
seemed to occupy the space a great city
soon it became surrounded with palisades
 minor morals
and a grated gate was opened through which
he saw hundreds and thousands and tens 
thousands genii pass in human shape
both men and women the women being
beautiful beyond anything he had ever seen
heard or imagined then came their prince
escorted by such multitudes perpetually increasing
that his brain got dizzy and he
fell down alarmed and exhausted and was
dangerously ill for more than a year since
then he could never dare to pronounce the
word djin and he could not hear it uttered
by any other person without its producing
the effect which they had just seen an
example
an art professed by some magicians in
the east is to stop a ball when discharged
from firearms and to secure the person
against whom it may be directed from danger
some time since there was a man
magicians 
from tlemecen in algiers who claimed the
possession this secret i have now in
the handwriting a french officer high
rank the following statement on the
th november i went with the
algerine to the dwelling a renegade
italian who commanded ali pacha's horse
artillery i took with me my own pistols
powder and balls and delivered them to my
servant to carry the algerine had not
touched either arms ammunition or wadding
he wrote something on a scrap paper
suspended it on his bosom and desired me
to fire but as i thought the experiment
rather too serious i proposed that a horse
dog sheep fowl or some other living animal
should be brought he immediately consented
and a hen which was running about
the courtyard was seized by my servant
and her legs tied the algerine keeping all
 minor morals
the while at a considerable distance took
the writing from the algerine and tied it on
myself to the hen's neck i took her into
the house and approaching her fired the
pistol she sprung up cackled but the
ball had fallen by her side and she was unhurt
the italian made a similar experiment
with the same results upon which we
released the hen who joined her companions
as if nothing had happened i keep the ball
as a souvenir this event though i have
reason to believe there is much credulity in
the character the frenchman i am sure
his veracity cannot be called in question
 our own countrymen have shown such
incredible credulity when speaking the
egyptian magicians that i do not hesitate
to transcribe from the mss a french
traveller the following narrative 
 while in the levant i made the acmagicians

acquaintance the celebrated slieikli said
mohammed omer effendi el cadi el giie
chant he was born at bagdad though his
usual abode was damascus his intercourse
with supernatural spirits was notorious and
after many urgent entreaties on my part he
consented to bring a djin into my presence
as i had expressed an intense desire to see
one these beings whom i had heard so
much he gave me a few words on a scrap
 paper and ordered me to repeat them one
hundred times before i went to bed on
three following nights i did punctually ashe
directed me not however expecting that
anything would come my obedience i
saw nothing either on the first second or third
night and went to the sheikh to inform him
that he had not succeeded in his arrangements
he told me that what had been done was
only the preliminary step but that i should see
h 
 minor morals
the djln in a human shape the following
night in a vision after i had followed his
instructions he then wrote a single word
upon another piece paper told me to repeat
it three hundred times before i went to
bed and then to place the paper under my
pillow you wil hear a loud voice he
said calling to you on the opposite side to
that where the djin will appear and it will
say behold the djin and the name
which is under your pillow will be repeated
i did as he told me and fell asleep i dreamt
that i stood in the middle a vast plain
without houses or trees or mountains the
plain the houses the heavens above were all
 a gloomy grey colour soon i perceived a
being in lillian form approaching from the
right side the place where i stood he was
 the middle size had a thick black beard
a face not thin but singularly pale and his
magicians 
eyes were fixed steadily on me a long
white garment descended from his shoulders
to his feet which it entirely covered andover
this was a long oriental scarlet robe
open in front his hand held a staff which
seemed either ice or salt the expression
 his eyes was terrible yet mine were
rivetted to his and i heard an awful voice
in my left ear i am the djin repeating
the name under my pillow he then
glided slowly and majestically away not step
by step for his feet moved not but still he
turned towards me and his glance seemed
to penetrate my very soul he disappeared
in the distance and i awoke
the writer adds i swear on my honour
that what i have related is literally and exactly
true i have added nothing i have
omitted nothing all the incredulity 
minor morals
rope will never persuade me that i have not
seen what i know i have seen
in march the exhibition i am
about to describe took place in the town 
napoli de romania
a jewish boy the age fifteen
who was employed at the customhouse declared
that he was persecuted by a djin
who haunted him in all directions all sorts
 exorcisms were tried in vain there was
at this time a magician at napoli called
kizitlu effendi who had studied the occult
sciences at fez in barbary and he was
called upon to practice his art on behalf 
the jewish boy for mussulmanss christians
and jews in the east are about equally
credulous a large company turks and
jews were assembled to see the magician
exhibit his influence soon after the boy
magicians 
entered the room and the magician began
his conjurations when the lad was seized
with a sudden and violent trembling and
being asked the cause his fears he said
he saw a negro who looked at him in a
most threatening way kizitlu effendi directed
the boy to inquire the negro in
what he had offended him and why he persecuted
him upon which the negro answered
that he was a djin and that in
passing under the window the boy's
house he had committed towards him a very
indecent act drenched him and that he had
determined to be revenged the magician
intreated the negro to desist and to forgive
the boy but he could not succeed upon
which he exhibited all the powers his
art and by long and elaborate conjurations
he forced the monarch the genii dine
parish to appear he came with a very
 minor morals
numerous and brilliant attendance but they
were only visible to the young jew who
carried on the conversation as directed by
the magician he addressed many compliments
to the prince on his gracious appearance
and having reported the stubbornness
 the negro entreated his majesty to consent
to the cure the jewish boy the
monarch ordered the negro to be brought
in for he had hurried away on the entrance
 his sovereign and immediately one the
attendants disappeared and soon came back
accompanied by the negro the negro
bent himself to the ground before his sovereign
but still resolutely persisted in his
determination to persecute the boy upon
which the king ordered in the executioner
who severed the negro's head from his body
and the boy was instantaneously restored to
health he has frequently been examined
magicians 
by travellers and persists in the truth his
story more than thirty persons were present
at the above scene who are unanimous
in the belief that everything passed which
i have spoken and the boy himself undoubtedly
believed it in an excited and
diseased state mind receiving all the impressions
 ignorance and credulity attributing
to supernatural agency consequences
which medical art might readily explain the
only real imposter being the magician who
by the dexterous management leading
questions and pictures presented to the boy's
mind soon filled a childish fancy with all
the chimeras his own imagination
the albanians in the pursuit hidden
treasures have long been in the habit using
candles made human fat stuck upon a
curved hazel stick they say that the candles
go out with an explosion whenever the
 minor morals
holder it approaches any spot where money
is concealed
but it is not always that the most celebrated
 magicians can exercise authority
over the djins mahomet effendi the kiaya
 ali pacha was a man great accomplishments
and some philosophical knowledge
but he had not been able to rid himself 
the superstitions his countrymen and the
palace in which he lived in albania was
haunted by djins he did indeed at one
time suspect that the stories told him were
tricks the servants to get possession the
best apartments the palace which were
abandoned by the family and not offered to
guests distinction on account the disturbances
which often were created in them by the
djins once he went with his son to ascertain
whether the report which had reached
him was true that the djins were throwing
magicians 
about the furniture and flinging stones into
the principal room his son preceded him
and had no sooner entered than his turban
was snatched off and flung into the effendi's
face son and father retreated in no small
hurry he spent large sums in bringing
magicians sheikhs and dervishes to exorcise
his palace but the djins were too
well satisfied with their abode to surrender
it to anybody he sent to remote places for
men who had the reputation sorcery on
one occasion he made a bargain with two
magicians to pay them a large sum if they
could free his house from djins they
were to take up their abode in the apartments
where the djins appeared to have
established their headquarters the magicians
withdrew after supper in order to
commence their exorcisms but previously to
doing this they as good mahometan had
 minor morals
to discharge their devotional duties in the
east people all religions carry a chaplet
called teshih in turkish on which they
write their prayers and which serves equally
for a plaything ornament and religious emblem
the usual number beads is a
hundred as they assist the worshipper in
repeating the hundred names god to
utter which is considered by the mussulman
as an act acceptable homage to the
deity but among the very ostentatious and
fanatical turks chaplets five hundred or
even a thousand beads are sometimes used 
betokening by the multitude their prayers
the superiority their piety the two magicians
had chaplets this unusual size
intended to give weight to their saintly character
as soon as they entered the chamber
 the djins they took their chaplets out 
their bosoms when lo they were suddenly
magicians 
snatched away and somewhat taken by surprise
at so unexpected a reception they
determined to defer the exorcisms to the following
day and betook themselves to sleep
next day when they came down stairs their
faces and beards were found unknown to
themselves to have been powdered with quicklime
and in the room are still patches 
lime left by the djins which the servants
say no washing or rubbing will remove the
two magicians refused to continue their attempt
and departed
another dervish for whom mahomet effendi
built an apartment in the court so
that he might more easily carry on his plans
for exorcising the djins did so far succeed
as to collect them all together in a room
but he had no sooner effected this than they
fell upon him gave him a terrible beating
and one them attempted to strangle him
 minor morals
the dervish rose up and disturbed the
whole house with his clamour and cries but
he was not able to utter a distinct word
next day he found his speech again but it
was to tell mahomet effendi that he would
not stay any longer for all the wealth he
could offer and he too hurried away
it looks much like a confederacy the
servants said george
it does indeed answered mr howard
infant schools
you promised dear papa said edith one
morning to mr howard that you would
take me to an infant school when shall
it be
this very morning if mamma sees no
objection and if your brothers can manage
to accompany us 
i'll go and see answered edith and
before mr howard could finish his sentence
she skipped away as lightly as a waterwagtail
that dances along the side a river she
found her brothers o george o arthur 
can you go are you ready
go where said george ready for
 minor morals
what asked arthur o papa says he
will take us to the infant school come
along so taking her brothers each by the
hand away they ran together to the parlour
here we all are papa here we are all
ready but edith was a little too eager
and on inquiry mr howard found that the
morning's lessons had not yet been learnt
duty first and recompense after said
mr howard and emily then remembered
that she had not waited to hear whether her
father meant to impose any conditions on
their visiting the infant school
you were somewhat hasty edith you
were too much in a hurry to go to your
brothers before you knew what you were to
say to them
edith blushed it was a sufficient confession
 well boys said mr howard an
hour will suffice for you to get through
infant schools 
your tasks at halfpast nine you will come
and if your lessons are thoroughly learnt
we will be off to the infant school
the lessons were learnt thoroughly and
cheerfully and at the appointed time the
boys and their sister were again in the parlour
ready to sally forth
on the way to the school mr howard
gave them some particulars the earliest
infant schools which had been established
and particularly that which mr owen
introduced at new lanark he took occasion
to speak the beautiful clyde scenery
adjacent to that busy village the fall
 cora lynn and the ever changing ever
renewed rainbows which the sunshine makes
out the scattered foam the waters
 balfour burley's cave which he reached
by the perilous leap over the frightful chasm
through which the clyde rolls thundering
 minor morals
and the various spots made illustrious by
the deeds ancient heroes or the songs and
stories modern bards i had often seen
solitary children happy said mr howard
or small groups children but i never
before saw a whole community children
so happy i had often seen a single child
pleased at being instructed but i never before
saw crowds children all learning and
all delighted with their learning i had
heard a child sing the song taught it by its
nurse but i never before heard a chorus 
children singing together in perfect harmony
i had seen children dancing about
in the fields but never before did i see
scores infants dancing in perfect order
and beating with their little feet to measures
as regular as art could make them
they reached the school the children
were singing the morning hymn did my
infant schools 
young readers ever hear the singing a
wellconducted infant school if they have
not let them go and listen certainly
papa this is sweeter than the music the
opera look at that very small child how
its eye follows the motions the lips the
one that is next to it see yon little boy
in petticoats marking time with his forefinger
without thinking what he is about how
many heads move in concert as it were with
the teacher's hark there's a girl singing
out tune she has stopped a looli from
anotheivgirl a little older has corrected her
 a little slower said the master giving
himself the example and every voice obeyed
the command now then quick and they
all followed their leader
is it not strange papa that learning so
soon they should learn so well inquired
george
vol iii i
 minor morals
it would be well perhaps if we could
be taught so early as not to remember in future
life when we had been taught there
are few things which have a happier influence
than the instruction children in the
musical art in many the cantons 
switzerland all young people are taught either
to sing or to play on some musical instrument
there is not a village which cannot
at all times provide a charming concert
there is no bashfulness no false shame
when a peasant is asked to sing in holiday
time when the people meet together i
have observed that music is invariably a part
 their pleasures not listening to a blind
fiddler or wandering bagpipeplayer but music
in parts music according to the rules art
if a party visit a fair they generally sing
both in going and returning and sing too
in perfect harmony again and again i have
infant schools 
fancied i was listening to people who make
music their trade when i have discovered
the sounds came from work people leaving
their houses for their daily labour or retiring
to their homes when the day's business
was over in a few years and with proper
care our schools will have introduced a new
art and a new enjoyment among the people
by making them musical
at this moment a very little child burst
into a violent fit crying this is her first
day said the master mary he said
beckoning to a child about four years old
who without saying a wori went and led
away the crying infant now see what will
happen said the master the tears will be
soon dried and so indeed it was for in a
few minutes mary came in conducting her
little charge who had a smile on her countenance
and who even appeared as happy as
 minor morals
the happiest in the group and how has
she managed asked edith what can she
have said or done i cannot always account
myself said the master for the
influence that one child possesses over another
even before they can talk plainly
there are certain children in the school who
can do more than i can with other children
in a day or two the infant is reconciled to
the strangeness or novelty the place and
to the new faces about it the scene is
one activity enjoyment the children
catch the infection the general happiness
this schoolroom this gardenground even becomes
delightfully attractive to them scores
 the children come long before the school
hours and there is great difficulty in getting
rid them when the school lours are over
mr howard went with edith into the garden
 many the children were playing
infant schools 
about edith remarked that fruit was hanging
on the trees and hanging too within
the reach the children they have been
already taught that the fruit is not theirs
and that they have no right to touch it if
the new comers are disposed to pilfer the
older scholars check and control them the
rights property may often be usefully
studied by grownup people in an infant
school
i should like to see a lesson given said
edith it was not long wanting a little
boy was playing with a ball there came up
another little fellow who kicked it away and
when he had done so ran after it took it
up and put it into his pocket the boy to
whom it belonged cried aloud the master
came and the children gathered round and
told him what had happened he did not
lecture the little boy but went to hint
 minor morals
and took his hat off his head he cried in
turn saying my hat my ball said
the master now young as he was he felt
the lesson and then the master in simple
words explained that the other boy had the
same right to his ball that he had to his hat
and by making the ease his own he was able
to make a practical application the golden
rule doing to others what we would they
should do unto us all questions right
and wrong said the master are in themselves
very simple and all the art my
teaching the children a sound morality consists
in finding the means presenting to
their senses in some palpable shape and so
 making intelligible to their minds the point
which i desire them to understand
and thus said the master i not only
teach the children but the parents the
children you would be surprised to be told
infant schools 
how many my little pupils are preceptors
in their turn how many lessons taught in
this school go home to the fireside to be
repeated to fathers and mothers and brothers
and sisters
that is indeed being instructed to some
purpose said arthur and his countenance
showed how much the conversation instructed
him
that little boy said the master pointing
to a child five years old saved his
father from a habit drunkenness i asked
the man when he told me the circumstance
which he did with tears in his eyes what the
boy had said to him he answered that he
did not know how it was but he had been
coaxed out his vice and so cunningly he
said that he could not be angry with the
boy whose looks were almost as convincing
as his words we have here a little fellow
 minor morals
who reads the newspaper to his parents and
the neighbours come to listen for he tells
them where the countries are and who are
the people about which he is reading and
can generally give them a great deal veryuseful
knowledge and is he not forward
and vain asked george you shall
see said the master and he called to a
poor little crippled fellow who blushed at
being noticed and whom george inquired
in what part the world was egypt and
what was the capital the country and
what was the course the nile and what
are the names its two principal branches
and its two mouths all which he was
able to answer without embarrassment and
all which i hope my young readers are
able to answer too
the party were all delighted with their
visit pleased with the teacher and the scho
infant schools 
lars and the infant school was often referred
to not only on account the lessons
taught but the felicity which it exhibited

i 
djezzar pacha
 pray let us hear papa something more
 the turks and their character give us
some account somebody who has distinguished
himself in the east some great
tyrant if you like said arthur
happily replied mr howard even
in the east there are no longer examples
 that extremely flagitious character which
were so common formerly i will give you
some particulars one the worst oppressors
and most cruel governors the
last generation the former pacha acre
or akka as it is called by the arabs and
djezzar pacha 
which as you perhaps know is the ptolemaic
 the new testament
djezzar pacha whose name which he
conferred upon himself signifies butcher was
one the most execrable modern despots
and yet he had the reputation being a
great warrior and at acre i heard a very
old man with a long white beard speak 
him with affection and seek to counterbalance
the history his atrocities by recounting
deeds generosity and valour he
murdered men it is true by wholesale in
cold blood but he built a beautiful mosque
an extensive bath and a delightful fountain
for the people there were no bounds to
his savage ferocity yet his tomb bears a
laudatory inscription and though more thana
quarter a century is passed since his
death upon that tomb beautiful fresh flowers
are growing which are daily watched and
 minor morals
watered with as much care as if they grew
upon the grave a beloved parent and were
tended by a grateful child
but tell us papa tell us something more
 this wicked man said arthur and little
edith asked could he really be so very
wicked 
yes answered mr howard he was
one those wretched beings who appear now
and then in the world as if to teach us
how very wicked a human being may become
who lets his evil passions get the upper hand
and who has power enough to exercise these
passions without control perhaps even
djezzar pacha was not quite so bad as he
was thought to be one his attendants
told me that he once murdered one hundred
and forty prisoners with his own hand but
what is quite certain is that in a fit jealousy
he drowned all the women his
djezzar pacha 
harem and decapitated his mamelukess in
the same day and i was told on the spot
that the number persons who were destroyed
on this occasion was between seventy
and eighty he spared only two persons
and they succeeded him in the pachalik
and were distinguished for their humanity
in the streets st john d'acre mutilated
persons are frequently seen i made there
the acquaintance the son his secretary
and he told me djezzar pacha had cut off
his father's nose and that there were few
persons about him who had not been mutilated
either by himself or his executioner
you have heard nero that he amused
himself by fiddling while rome was burning 
and it was with jokes and jeers that djezzar
pacha used to issue his horrible orders he
would sometimes lay down on his divan call
 minor morals
in his executioner and say such a man
looked at me with an evil eye he must not
do so again tear his eye out and it was
done that fellow heard something which
he ought to have told me what is the use
 his ears cut them off and the order
was obeyed why did not that djaour
smell out what is doing in the town slice
away his nose and he would thus go on
laughing and seeing his dreadful commands
immediately carried into execution
and why did not the people rise and
destroy him inquired the children did
he die a natural death 
yes and his very last thoughts were
thoughts and purposes cruelty on his
deathbed he ordered a list sixty persons
to be made out for mutilation among whom
was a very rich man now living and who
djezzar pacha 
is the austrian consul at said but before
the shocking decree could be executed the
monster died
but why are such wicked men ever born
and why are they allowed to live and to do
such abominable things inquired arthur
if we think such men and such actions
separately from the whole course events 
if our feelings dwell on them without considering
them as a part the great whole
 the arrangements and government the
divine being it is difficult to say why permission
has been given to any mortal to
create so much misery but out all this
evil much good may grow in order that
tyranny should be hated and put an 
to tyrants must be allowed to commit their
horrid deeds the mischief they can inflict
is only temporary and may be repaired in
 minor morals
a single generation the lesson they give is

mohammedanism
i am afraid papa you have often had
to witness much want charity in the
east on account religious opinions
said george
uncharitableness said mr howard is
the common growth ignorance and is as
much the consequence the absence general
knowledge as the knowledge 
the true character the christian religion
whose very essence is charity but
the examples set by dominant sects are too
generally those persecution the strong
will not allow the weak either to think or
act for themselves at silistria which you
mohammedanism 
know is a town on the turkish or right
bank the danube i remember descending
into a dark vault where the greek
christians were celebrating their religious
rites the mussulmanss would not permit
them to worship their god in the light 
day and their intolerance was bitterly and
justly complained well the place was
taken possession by the russians in
their wars with the turks in and
the russians began to erect a large and
beautiful christian temple and what a
lesson to mahommedan infidels did these
christians give when they were masters 
i should tell you nothing is more sacred
to the mahometan than the cemeteries
 the dead thither they habitually resort
there rise their beautiful groves 
cypresses there they plant their family
flowers and the russians tore up the
 minor morals
mussulman gravestones in silistria and
out these alone did they construct the
vast edifice which was to be dedicated to
the christian's god the god love the
god all mankind and this this was
the lesson they gave to their mussulman
neighbours the church is still unfinished
it stands a lasting opprobrium to those who
meant to rear it a monument which will
feed for ages the hatred the mohammedan
towards those who have learned
christ not in truth not in charity butin
pride and insult and folly
indeed said mr howard all the
words or teachings wise and virtuous
men will never effect a reconciliation or
even obtain a patient attention if such
untoward and wicked acts are allowed to
be practised by those in authority
 europeans too frequently when they
mahommedanism 
get into the east assume the despotic
and reckless character which they see
too many examples not long ago a
prussian prince being refused entrance at
jerusalem into the tomb david which
is considered one the most sacred places
possessed by the mussulmanss forced his way
by actual violence and the consequence
has been that peaceable christian travellers
have been stoned in the street and exposed
to much danger and the entrance to many
interesting spots which were before accessible
to them is now wholly denied
but in spite all does not a more
tolerant spirit pervade the east asked
george
assuredly and but for the misconduct
 a few many the barriers separation
would be broken down and the minds
 mussulmanss be gradually prepared even
 minor morals
for the reception christian truth mahomet
ali who has done more than any
turk that ever lived to give development
to a more liberal state things has for
his prime minister an armenian christian
boghos bey than whom no man is more
attentive to the observance his religious
creed his accountantgeneral bailies bey
is a member the ancient egyptian coptic
church his principal interpreter and secretary
is also a christian and christians
occupy many the highest offices the
state in damascus where a few years
ago no man could with safety go through
the bazaar in a european christian dress
and where frank women have been frequently
shot at by the fanatics that holy
city there is now the most complete security
and no one is molested for not being
a mussulman
mahommedanism 
holy city papa interrupted edith
i thought mecca and medina were the
holy cities the mussulmanss
they are so but so are also damascus
and jerusalem for you know course that
the mahometan recognize many the most
distinguished prophets the old and new
testament i saw at cairo in the school 
the english missionaries and with the highest
satisfaction many mahommedan children
one them was the son a servant 
mine and he told me that if the masters took
care to avoid speaking ill his prophet
and his prophet's followers he did not
object to the course instruction pursued
that his wife had had some scruples at first
but he had convinced her the boy would
only get good at the school but that if
mahomet were reviled there he should 
course take him away this will enable you
 minor morals
to judge somewhat the state things
which is growing up in egypt and which
if properly watched and prudently concentrated
will i have no doubt bring with it
lasting and immense results
what are the observances most rigidly
attended to by mahonmiedans asked
george
prayer and ablution but the duty 
prayer has not given rise to such discussions
as that washing the mussulman
prays five times a day and his manner 
praying is formally and unchangeably established
the number prostrations the
moment and the mode prostration are
taught without any variation and though the
devout mussulman may lengthen his prayer
or employ extemporaneous prayer in addition
to those his ritual the obligatory prayers
 that ritual are defined but on the quesmohammedanism

tion ablutions infinite are the differences
 opinion and the discussions among the
ulemas run into every conceivable refinement
and absurdity when the question is what
degree adulteration will produce impurity
you easily suppose what thousands shades
opinions may take i heard this question
agitated at cairo if a cat fall into a well
how far will it render the waters impure 
but then came other questions was the cat
dead or alive if dead how long had it
been dead if dead how long had it lain
in the well what was the size the cat
and what the quantity the water was
the water wholly pure before would any
single element impurity be sufficient to
render any quantity water impure would
the action time and the gushing the
spring at the foot the well rid it in time
 its impure elements might a drop or
vol iii k
 minor morals
more the water taken from the well
render pure water impure might a vessel
be used without offence whose exterior only
had touched the water the well would
the heat the water add to or diminish its
impurity if the cat being alive had
escaped from the well would the waters
continue pure if being dead the cat
were carried away by an eagle descending
into the well when would the waters be
purified again into such frivolities do men
fall when religions become more ceremonial
than practical and when the observance 
external forms instead internal convictions
acting upon conduct becomes the business and
the rule life
the attention the mussulmanss to the
duty prayer is perhaps that part their
religious service which is most striking it
is not ostentatious but it is never neglected
mahommedanism 
by a devout mussulman in whatever society
lie may find himself he spreads his
cloak by his carpet goes through the various
attitudes prayer kneels bends his forehead
to the earth raises his hands ox
presses them to his breast and is perfectly
regardless all that is passing around him
the habit public prayer is so universal
that it never excites a remark often and
often have i seen the arab in the desert
the fisherman in his boat the day labourer
in his field the traveller by the fountain or
the river the shopkeeper in the bazaar the
artizan in his workshop the minister in his
divan engaged as earnestly as the ulema
in the mosque in the discharge this oftrecurring
duty sometimes in silence sometimes
in low accents sometimes aloud when
a priest or mufti is present it generally
 minor morals
happens that he takes his place in front 
the other worshippers who form a line
behind him follow his movements and sometimes
respond to his ejaculations in addition
to the required prayers the mussulman
frequently repeats the hundred names 
allah on his beads which are his constant
companions and which serve alike as a plaything
and a religious memento
and yet papa do you not think the
secret and solitary prayer the prayer 
retirement more acceptable to god asked
george
all prayer and praise which emanate
from a pure and devout heart is no doubt
welcomed by him to whom they are addressed
 but one the most beautiful lessons
 the new testament is this when thou
priest enter into thy closet and when
mahommedanism 
thou hast shut the door pray to thy father
who is in secret and thy father who seeth
in secret himself shall reward thee openly
 are the prayers the mussulmanss all
prayers learnt by heart or do they sometimes
pray extemporaneously inquired
arthur
adoration is a more fitting word than
prayer for the worship the mussulmanss
the obligatory forms are repetitions 
god he is most great that he
is supremely glorious that praises are due
to god and to god alone there is one
supplication for peace upon the prophet and
his followers and a declaration the worshipper
that there is one god alone and
that mahomet is the prophet god verses
 the koran are sometimes added to the
prayer particularly a very striking verse
at the the second chapter beginning 
 minor morals
god no deity is there but god and
ending with he is the exalted the great 
which the mussulmanss call the verse 
the throne but it is seldom that prayer
adapted to particular contingencies or events
is employed by them
djins
though the children were interested in the
accounts mr howard gave them his travels
yet it was observable they listened with
particular attention to the stories which had
in them any the romance the east
and particularly where unearthly beings were
introduced i do so wish papa would tellus
something more about oriental fairies and
strange beings whispered edith to arthur
but loud enough to be overheard by mr
howard who smiled upon the little girl
which encouraged her to ask in a very
winning way do you think you dear
 minor morals
mamma could persuade papa we will
try was mrs howard's answer so alien
the happy hour evening came mr howard
took his accustomed seat and began so
you want some more supernatural stories do
you well then so be it
the proceedings the djins or oriental
genii resemble in most particulars those 
the ghosts in great britain haunted houses
in the east are sometimes abandoned by
their owners and may frequently be obtained
at a rent much beneath their fair value in
these houses rattling noises are said to be
heard the clanking chains showers 
stones fallsthe furniture is thrown about 
the lights extinguished the water cisterns
emptied the dishes removed from the tables
and other similar derangements take place
it is very usual for the turks to employ
djins 
exercises and even to spend large sums 
money in order to get their houses abandoned
by the djins
very odd stories are told the freaks
 the djins at omer aga's haunted house
at libokovo in epirus the djins threw a
great quantity stones among an assembled
company now how kind it would be said
one the guests if they would give us
roasted chesnuts instead stones anon a
shower roasted chesnuts skinned ready for
eating fell into the room which the persons
present the cadi among the number declared
to be excellent
but a far more remarkable circumstance
is said to have occurred in this very house
in the first week august in the year 
the hegira ad omer aga
had invited his friends to dinner and a
number stones fell upon the table and
k 
 minor morals
among the guests you are always throwing
stones said omer aga why cannot you
throw us gold now and then immediately
a piece gold fell on the table bright as
from the mint it bore the year the
hegira but instead the name 
the sultan selim then the reigning prince
the name sultan mustapha was inscribed
the coin wassent off to ali pacha at tannin
who expressed his astonishment but a few
days afterwards brought the account the
murder selim and his having been
succeeded by his nephew the sultan 

but the djins have a great antipathy to
those who disbelieve in their existence omer
aga had a visiter called hussein aga who
i mention the story as i heard it but there is in
it an obvious anachronism selim was deposed in 
and mustapha in 
mins 
in mounting the staircase cried out your
djins where are your djins they take
care to keep out the way upon which
he got so violent a slap on the face from an
invisible hand that his turban rolled down to
the foot the stairs and he was flung
against the bannisters and so frightened that
he was conveyed home and kept his bed for
more than a fortnight
one hears more instances their odd
humours than their malignity they pull
people out bed blow out their candles
leaving them in the dark knock glasses out
 the hands those who are drinking take
off men's turbans and in fact play the tricks
 schoolboys or spoiled children
the house boushenak mahmoud pacha
the exgovernor lepanto was said to be
haunted by a negro giant whom the servants
declared they had often seen but as most
 minor morals
 those servants were bosniacks less credulous
and more courageous than orientals
generally the presence the intruder did
not cause much disturbance in the house
one night however when everybody else was
asleep a greek saraidar servant all work
called nicol disturbed the whole family by
loud cries for help the pacha himself and
all the servants rose ran into the greek's
chamber who was almost dead with fright
and said an enormous negro woman with a
menacing look had entered his chamber
jumped upon his body and seizing him by
the throat had attempted to strangle him 
but alarmed at his cries as he supposed
had disappeared saying tomorrow shalt
thou see me again everything was done
to console and to encourage him and he
entreated he might not be left alone upto
that moment he had been in perfect health
djins 
the next day several his fellow servants
entered his room he was rising to meet
them when he suddenly screamed out the
negress and fell down dead
this was course a case nightmare
acting upon a very weak and superstitious
person
i heard a curious case possession by a
djin in which the subject was a mussulman
girl fourteen she was sitting in the
corridor the harem at two o'clock in the
afternoon when a negro appeared and menaced
her with a lance which he shook at
her the fright prevented her from crying
out but after a few minutes the black disappeared
and a european stood in his place
holding in his hand a glass water which
he directed her to drink the girl thought
they were both ordinary mortal men and
cried out that a man had made his way into
 minor morals
the harem all the women the harem
rushed in veiled and the girl called out
several times look look he wants to force
me with his spear to drink the water but
the women could see nothing they encouraged
however the girl to refuse the water
which she did very stoutly though the european
continued to urge her for a quarter
 an hour and then struck her several blows
with the lance which left severe contusions 
after which he disappeared but at six o'clock
in the same afternoon she felt herself possessed
and the white spirit said he had
entered into her in order to shut out the
black one
the following conversation took place
between this girl and a gentleman who was
allowed to converse with her
 q who art thou j a djin not
 the human race
djins 
 thy name abduliliaz
 where wert thou before thou interest
this woman here
 how old art thou that is beyond
thy poor conception
 where are thy companions it matters
not to thee
 what becomes the soul man after
death after death thou wilt know 
 are the planets inhabited go and
see if thou canst 
 hast thou seen them that is no
business thine 
 art thou a creature god dost
thou think god has created nothing nobler
than things like thee 
 hast thou any religion assuredly 
 tell me what it teaches tis no
concern thine 
 is your race immortal no 
 minor morals
 are you male and female yes 
have you parents and children 
impudent and foolish inquirer 
 where dwells the supreme being 
i know not
 is there more than one sort spirits
roukhanis ay more than human
arithmetic can reckon 
 what class art thou one 
the least perfect and the most resembling
man
 what is your external form we have
no form that can be conceived by a narrow
mind like thine 
 how then didst thou take a human
shape thou couldst not understand me
and tis not thy business to know
 dost thou eat or drink it concerns
thee not
 is there a distinction rank and power
djins 
among you power yes but what
hast thou foolish creature to do with
that 
 why dost thou insult me thy questions
are insults
 then don't answer i have my reasons
for answering
 tell me what they are they do
not concern thee
 canst thou look into futurity that
is the attribute the creator
 canst thou read the thoughts man 
 sometimes
 what means sometimes i neither
can nor will i tell thee
art thou acquainted with what we call
mathematics i know the science numbers
better than you or all your teachers
dost thou know the quadrature the
circle yes
 minor morals
 explain it to me i beseech thee 
 i will not 
 why because thou weariest me
dost thou know the physical sciences
better than men do yet i am but ignorant

 what gives its influence to the magnet
and the magnetized steel thou wilt
learn this after death know that i was not
sent here to teach thee
 yet i would willingly learn some truths
from thee the truth truths is god
 i knew that before then thou
knowest enough
 but i would fain know more god
and god's works to adore him more
devoutly surely it would be a merit in
thee to instruct me in this i thou knowest
enough for man to know after death thou
wilt know more and as to the merit in
djins 
strutting one tliy despicable dying race
that would be small indeed
 why is our race despicable study
that in your books morality
 hast thou read our books never 
 how then dost thou know their contents
 how that is above thy comprehension
i am a djin thou art but a man
 where dwells thy race enough i
will answer no more
not another word could be obtained
the questioner made several attempts and
so did divers other persons who were present
but the girl kept an unbroken silence
a sheikh was called in to exorcise the girl
but he failed a few days afterwards she
said that the djin had told her he meant to
abandon her and he did so she declaring
herself quite well and happy
 minor morals
these facts are interesting for they serve
to show how completely the popular belief
 the jews as to the possession by evil spirits
which is so often referred to in the new
testament still maintains itself in oriental
countries
djins are supposed often to take the
shape huge negroes in a number
 persons in the service well pacha were
travelling on horseback from tirnova to clarissa
 among them was a greek secretary
whose horse when they had performed about
half their journey suddenly bolted and the
rider shrieked aloud bending himself forward
over the horse's neck as if to escape from a
blow levelled at his head and he remained for
some time stupefied and speechless his companions
inquired into the cause and he told
them that he had seen a gigantic negro 

proach with a naked sword in his hand with
which he had aimed a blow at him to sever
his head from his body they all considered
the matter as a joke and laughed at the
credulity the secretary when the same
party was returning to clarissa near the same
spot the horse again started the greek secretary
uttered a loud scream and fell lifeless
on the ground three european christians
were mentioned to me as having been
present
to the djins the orientals attribute half
the calamities life if you ask a blind
man the cause his misfortunes he will
very likely attribute it to the malignity a
djin if he fall from a ladder and break a
limb he will often fancy it was a djin that
threw him down if he lose his way he
will tel you it was a djin that led him
 minor morals
astray if he enter into an unfortunate speculation
it was a djin that suggested it in
his waking or his sleeping dreams in nine
cases out ten superstition and credulitybring
consolation to the people the levant
as in the greater events life they
perceive the hand inevitable destiny and
therefore accommodate themselves patiently
and piously to the decrees heaven so in
less important matters they like to think
that it is not by their own imprudence or
fault that life's lighter calamities visit them
the interference supernatural beings explain
all difficulties how could i have
prevented it is the question they put to
themselves and as both their own selflove
and the opinions their neighbour answer 
you could not resignation is easily practised

djins 
and now said mr howard you
must be almost tired with these stories 
the genii the east
o no no no exclaimed the young
people some other day papa you must
tell us some more
sincerity with prudence
at the next family meeting the conversation
turned on the great varieties human character
which are found not only in the
inhabitants regions remote from one another
but even among those born under the same
form government speaking the same language
and educated under the same system
it would be difficult observed mr
howard to say whether wisdom ind goodness
are exhibited most in those points in
which men resemble or in which they differ
from one another out their resemblance
their sympathies grow and yet if the resemblance
were so complete as to prevent
sincerity with prudence 
persons from being easily distinguished what
confusion and embarrassment there would be
in the world 
i am often amused continued mr howard
at the different and contrasted views
men take the same objects society would
be very dull if the same thoughts occurred
to every mind alike on the same occasion 
mr howard liked to throw out remarks
such as this in order to give his children
the opportunity applying them to subjects
which had occupied their attention
i have just been reading a curious instance
in point said george
let us hear it then your repeating it
will impress it on your memory
the spanish ambassador on his introduction
to henry the ivth france said
he was very anxious to ascertain the chas
iii l
 minor morals
racteristic qualities his ministers you
shall judge them yourself said the king
he first called silvery his chancellor and
said mr chancellor there's a beam loose
in the palace above my head i am afraid it
will fall and injure me we will send for
the architect sire and have the repairs attended
to he called in next villeroi the minister
 war who answered it is most true
sire and it is a very fearful thing the
third minister was the president tannin and
he responded i don't understand you sire 
if i am not blind the beam is sound and
steady you may sleep in peace the roof
will last longer than any us when they
were gone the king said to the ambassador
have you learnt their characters the
chancellor does not know his otti meaning
villeroi never contradicts me but echoes
sincerity with prudence 
back what lie fancies is my opinion jeanin
thinks like a wise man and speaks like
an honest one
very much to the purpose said mr
howard and a lesson too on the value 
sincerity in the presence superiors men
frequently get into the habit shaping their
expressions to the supposed opinions those
superiors it is natural enough as like
loves like according to an old phrase that
a similarity sentiment should be acceptable
and yet different and even opposed opinions
may be so expressed as to give no
pain whatever the true art conversation
is to blend sincerity with courtesy never
to sacrifice truth but to wound as little as
possible the selflove others there is
much in manner there is much in tone
tannin's speech was not wanting in respect
or it would not have excited as it did the
 minor morals
applause the king it is an instructive
example courteous frankness and sincerity
too now i will show you in a description
 two persons whom i know very well the
contrast between the frankness that takes a
courteous and that which takes an uncourteous
form
mr sharp is a man considerable
ability he was admirably educated and by
continuing to read the best books that are
written and by mingling with the best society
 his neighbourhood he never talks
but to give information and it is impossible
to consult him on any topic without being
benefited by the information he communicates
and he is really and at heart a
kind and benevolent man he gives his
money liberally to all good purposes he
will take much trouble to oblige and is
honest in all his intentions and upright in all
sincerity with prudence 
his conduct but lie has manners so repulsive
his forms expression have so much
acerbity he seems so bent on appearing ungracious
that his good qualities have not half
the influence nor do they produce a hundredth
part the happiness they might be
expected to do he does the most agreeable
things disagreeably and if a disagreeable
thing is to be done by him he makes it
tenfold worse by the tone and manner which
he assumes i have heard poor people say
they had rather have mr goodman's refusal
than mr sharp's consent they had rather
fail with mr goodman than succeed with mr
sharp
mr goodman is mr sharp's friend and
neighbour with less talent and far less
instruction than mr sharp he has ten
times his influence everything he says he
says so graciously and kindly everything
 minor morals
he does is so characterized by a regard to
the feelings others that he is an object
 universal affection to those around
him his experience the world has enabled
him to appreciate the true excellences
 mr sharp's character to pass charitablyover
the harshness his manners and to
avail himself the soundness his mind
in this way he really uses mr sharp's influence
as well as his own for their intimacy
leads to a constant communion between them
mr goodman tolerates and passes by unnoticed
expressions such as those which have created
for mr sharp a host enemies mr sharp
is known by the title the disagreeable
man whenever he speaks there is a disposition
to dislike him truth itself from his
lips loses half its value and beneficence itself
half its recommendation i recollect a
case in point
sincerity with prudence 
a cottage belonging to a poor man had
been destroyed by fire owing to the poor
man's imprudence he bad fallen asleep
having in his mouth a lighted pipe which
fell and ignited a bundle straw that was
near him so that he had some difficulty in
escaping and enabling his wife to escape
the next morning mr sharp called with
the purpose really relieving and assisting
the poor man a lecture on imprudence
might have been a proper thing at a proper
time but at a moment when the poor man
had received so terrible a lesson and when
he was reduced to destitution by his
own fault it was not kind nor thoughtful
in mr sharp to speak reproachfully to the
sufferers but his first words were thomas 
you careless fellow upon which thomas
whose heart was big enough to burst before
 minor morals
replied o sir and wringing ms hands
ran away from the scene his calamities it
was in fact more than he could bear and his
poor wife overwhelmed with their common misery
and thinking how needless it was to add
to it by any reproaches said in tones loud
enough to be heard hardhearted man 
now though mr sharp was really a charitable
man and had come to the cottagers
for the purpose serving them his pride
took offence at conduct and expressions which
he thought insulting to him and he walked
morosely though not angrily away
thomas returned to the ruins his cottage
which mr sharp had left i have
offended him he said to his wife i have
done so ten times more she answered for
i could not bear his unkindness it was
enough to lose our all it was enough to
sincerity with prudence 
have no bed to rest upon no roof to rest
under but why did lie abuse us the
poor my children have their pride as well
as the rich and it sometimes breaks forth
most violently in the moments their utter
destitution thomas and his wife shed bitter
tears each repeating to the other he
needed not have added to our misery
 there were many persons grouped round
the cottages they had heard mr sharp's
words and had seen him walk away a
loud murmur followed him a low groan 
reprobation and yet as i told you he came
with the kindest intentions the infirmity
 temper thwarted them all one
hasty word one little incident turned the
whole current his friendly thought and
condemned him to the severest judgment 
the slanders by
and yet mr sharp was fond popular
l 
 minor morals
applause but his failings often subjected him
as in this instance to popular reprobation
mr goodman happened to pass by soon
after he did not come with any purpose
 helping the sufferers from the fire but
he saw many people collected and he heard
his friend mr sharp spoken in most
opprobrious terms he knew they were undeserved
in fact as always happens what
had passed had been terribly exaggerated
mr sharp was accused all sorts inhumanity
and it seemed as if every one were
occupied in choosing the worst words reproach
to which their lips could give utterance

 what does all this mean asked mr
goodman and a hundred answers told him
 mr sharp's cruelty to the cottagers
now this is impossible said he to the
crowd mr sharp is an excellent and most
slncehlty with prudence 
humane man sometimes a little harsh in his
manner speaking but always endeavouring
and intending to do right i am sure
he never meant any unkindness but all mr
goodman's words were wasted you judge
others by yourself the people answered but
they continued towards mr sharp their sentence
 condemnation and all appeals all
reasonings were in vain
mr sharp suffered so much in the public
opinion from this incident that he lost a
very honourable public situation to which he
had been called by his fellow citizens and
for which in truth he was admirably fitted
by talent and study
but was he not most hardly used inquired
arthur indeed he was replied
mr howard but i have narrated the circumstance
to you in order that you may see
what annoying consequences may grow out
 minor morals
 a small defect i told you that mr sharp
was ambitious he got the fame being disagreeable
and i am sorry to say he is now
an unhappy man j
v 
treasure seeking
in the levant
but when are we to have some more
stories about the credulity the orientals 
inquired arthur when the lessons were done
and the happy family circle gathered again
together cannot you remember some other
story to tell us dear papa
stories enough answered mr howard
so many that it is difficult to choose between
them
i told you the belief in ghosts is almost
universal in the treasureseeking east even
among the christian levantine population
and there is scarcely one who has not some
 minor morals
tale to tell his own knowledge and experience
which to doubt or dispute would
be deemed and perhaps resented as an insult
i will give an example in the words
 the narrator a ragusan captain well
known in the east
 i am in the habit trading with alexandria
in egypt some time ago i knew a
jewish tailor there who spoke italian tolerably
well and frequently acted as my
interpreter so that wee became friends on
account the services he rendered me
but on arriving at alexandria after one 
my voyages i sought in vain for my hebrew
acquaintance and was told he was
settled at canea in candia it happened
some time after this that i had a cargo for
that port and i inquired about the fate and
fortunes my friend his jewish brethren
told me that he and all his family were re
treasureseeking in the levant 
duce to extreme poverty and that their
misery had been heightened by a stroke 
the palsy with which the poor man had
been attacked i sought his abode and
found him a wretched cripple having lost
the use all his limbs though his senses
continued perfect his wife and his two sons
 the ages fourteen and fifteen exhibited
the same marks having been smitten by
the palsy and his only daughter seven
years old had alone escaped the general
misery a poor old jewess was paid by the
jewish community canea for serving this
unhappy family i inquired what had happened
to him since he left egypt and i
heard from his own lips as follows 
 i left alexandria in the hope bettering
my condition and when i had settled
here some my brethren told me that i
had been most lucky in the choice my
 minor morals
house for it was well known there was treasure
hidden under the staircase i was only a tenant
so i got together all my means made a liberal
offer for its purchase to the tuik who was
its owner which he accepted myself my
wife and sons then set diligently about
removing the earth under the staircase
after digging down some feet we discovered
a large black slabstone which we raised
with incredible toil and trouble and at a
short distance beneath it we perceived the
lid a chest but as we approached it it
began to descend and descended deeper and
deeper as we dug i called out to my
eldest son to get ropes and poles so that
we might be able to seize and to lift the
chest and from the moment that the lad
went in search them the chest remained
stationary and sunk no more but as it was
a little below the surface the ground
treasureseeking in the levant 
we could not get hold it my son arrived
with the poles and the ropes and we
began to dig holes by the sides the
chest in order that we might pass the ropes
under it and so raise it up but we had
scarcely commenced operations ere the chest
sunk down again and all our efforts were
vain i grew red and mad with rage and
swore that neither ghost nor devil should
deprive me the treasure my wife and
children repeated my exclamations and we
set to work with greater ardour than before
when lo the chest sunk down with a dreadful
crash and a hideous monster in the
shape a huge toad looked out the
hole what happened next i know not but
we were all found the next morning palsystruck
and in the state in which you now
see us here the jew finished his narrative
and i gave him some money for his imme

date wants but being somewhat incredulous
i asked him if he would allow me to
visit the place and to try my own fortune
there at first he resisted violently but i
succeeded in obtaining his consent i went
on board my ship and landed again accompanied
by four my best sailors having
brought a strong windlass on shore we
began to dig under the staircase at one
o'clock in the afternoon when we had dug
about three feet down we perceived a black
flagstone which we raised after very great
exertions and digging lower down we perceived
the cover the chest in the very
centre which was a large ring to which
we fastened a stout rope without any opposition
or difficulty in a transport delight
one the sailors exclaimed now by st
anthony it shan't escape upon which
the windlass was shivered to pieces the chest
treasureseeking in the levant 
fell down with a frightful noise it was as
if immense masses broken iron pottery
and tin ware had fallen into a deep well
a noisome stench burst forth and we were
all us glad to scamper away as fast as
our fright would let us

some the events connected with the presence
 the moorish conquerors in spain
was an observation made by mr howard to
the children are the most pathetic
that have been recorded by history pray
papa said george tell us something
 those people who as you told us have
written hundreds and hundreds volumes
and improved the agriculture and advanced
the instruction the people they conquered
and left permanent traces their wisdom on
the soil spain
i will read to you answered mr
abu abdallah 
howard a little historical sketch an
event the final event in the moorish history
 spain and mr howard opening
his desk drew forth a paper and read as
follows 
if beings superior to man had been
charged to construct a glorious stage for the
exhibition some great event in which
nations should be the actors and divinities
the spectators they would have spread out
the vega or garden granada and have
surrounded it with mountains like those which
overlook that magnificent plain there it is
no fiction to say that the fruits the north
and the south are blended and the flowers
 different regions flourish in the same soil
the cold freshness winter comes down
from the snowy tops the sierra to temper
the hot winds wafted over from the african
continent

it would not be easy for the imagination
to add one additional charm to the romantic
attraction the canadian scenery towering
over the rest the central points beauty
and sublimity rises the snowy mountain
sierra nevada around which are gathered
other mountains rugged and broken but
gradually declining in height till the undulation
scarcely rises above the surface the
mediterranean sea the base the sierra
nevada is not less than sixty miles wide
and its two most prominent coronals veleta
and muley harem are feet higher
than the ocean level wild and barren as
is the appearance the sierra from the distance
it has numberless verdant and picturesque
recesses in which churches and convents
and villages and cottages are scattered
profusely the district called the alpus
arras sacred to arabic song the scene
abu abdallah 
 so much wild romance and which even
in the present day so often echoes with the
sounds the pipe and tabor and the voice 
the minstrel is composed the various elevations
 hill and valley which lie between
the snowy mountain and the mediterranean
down to which a majestic range hilly
heights extends ending in that promontory
so well known to mariners as the cape de
gat on every side the sierra nevada puts
forth its gigantic arms to the west branches
out the tegea overlooking the moorish
cities lama and velez malaga and
crowned like its proud superior with a diadem
 everlasting snow to the north are
the parapanda and the elvira mountains
each standing alone and unsupported looking
down in their solitudes on that vast
amphitheatre where granada appears in its
ruined glories a little further east is the

renowned alpaca the jiuenlium aquarium
whose watersources pour refreshment over a
wide extent fertility and feed that delicious
fountain hidden in one the mountain
dells whose surrounding prospects have
been in all times the pride and the bosist 
moors and christians the vega or garden
in which granada is built requires more
than a day's journey to traverse it is watered
by the river genii which has its origin
in the snow streams at the foot one 
the peaks the sierra nevada and rolls
down in wild and wandering way through
the broken and tortuous channel it has made
among the precipices it rushes passionately
and precipitately down to the plains granada
and then proceeds onwards in calm
and quiet dignity lingering as it were
among the green scenery till the mountains
 loja oppose its progress when it rages
abu abdallah 
anew forces at last its unobstructed course
to the wondrous seville and weds itself with
the quadalquivir its equal in strength and
grandeur the genii is the stream which
the poets have called divine a title which
cervantes has confirmed in his renowned
romance the idea its divinity say old
chronicles originated in its high descent the
gods have been always fabled to inhabit
exalted abodes and to associate with them
rivers rolling down from inaccessible elevations
was but a natural and pardonable
fancy
abu abdallah the last the moorish
monarchs granada lingered on the spot
which since the day his exile has borne
the name el suspiro del moro the
moor's sigh tradition has preserved the
details the affecting scene and even as
recorded by the dull though erudite conte
vol iii m
 minor morals
ill his history the arabs in spain it
is one the most pathetic passages with
which i am acquainted the yellow flag 
iberia was floating on the towers the alhambra
 abdallah heard the shouts joy
and granulation which welcomed the christian
conquerors he was almost deserted and
those who remained taunted him with his
misfortunes his favourite wife shouted ya
kasil coward in his ear and his few followers
talked loudly the glories iii
forefathers it is generous he said to
wound the wounded allah jniahar blessed
be allah he added and passed onward towards
the alpujarras in peace once again
from the paul hill abdallah looked back
on the city on the palace and the quiet
stream it was his last look and terribly did
he struggle with his sorrow he subdued it
he shed no tear one sigh alone broke
abu abdallah 
from him it was loud and deep and those
who heard it called the spot the moor's
sigh a name by which it is still known
as the story is known to the meanest peasant
 andalusia
among the moorish attendants abu
abdallah there was one whose appearance
particularly distinguished him from the rest
he uttered no one word either sorrow or
 consolation he joined not in the re
piracies the revilers and nothing broke
his silence but a sigh which responded to
that his master a sigh which shook his
frame he covered his eyes as if ashamed
 his weakness but it was to wipe away a
tear he seemed strengthened by the triumph
over his own feelings and walked
onward the firmest and the first among the
melancholy crowd his name was abdil
abdallah looked upon him with an ex
 minor morals
pression tenderness that completed the
influence which the misfortunes the sovereign
had made upon the heart the
subject
abdallah entreated the rest his followers
to tarry promising that he would
soon rejoin them he had beckoned to
abdil who bowed his head betokening his
humble obedience and together they turned
away into a bye path on the paul hill
on one the green spots where the
tracks the wild goats are lost abdallah
seated himself while abdil stood silent at
his side
 seat thyself near me said the dethroned
monarch and let us talk together
 our evil destiny
 allah lumbar was abdil's reply our
destiny is in allah's hands and he knoweth
what is best
abu abdallah 
let us talk our miseries abdil we
shall bear them the easier when we see
how mighty they are to bear them is
worthy a courageous spirit and the more
intolerable they appear the nobler will bethe
effort which instructs us to submit to
them with magnanimity
 noble teaching and still nobler teacher
said abdil hitherto calamity has taught me
the weakness and not the strength mortal
nature it has opened to me hidden
frailties and unveiled the infirmity resolution
and the poverty and helplessness 
courageous desire
 what value is courage said the
monarch if it fail when it is most needed
there is little valour in following him who
flees the bravery conquest may or may
not be acceptable in allah's holy eye but if
the conquered shrink and bend and break
 minor morals
beneath the burthen calamity can he hope
for respect or confidence can he be worthy
 a better fate in better days will allah
change the doom the creature he must
contemn or look with anything but scorn
on the man who takes from adversity its sole
title to honour which is to bear oneself
proudly while smarting beneath its discipline

 thou at least king abdallah art entitled
to the honour as thou art supported
by the strength virtue for what heavier
griefs were ever flung upon one the
faithful than upon thee 
 they might have been far far more
intolerable i have thy friendship abdil 
thy fidelity i might have been a lonely
mourner with none to hear me none to console
me none to advise with me none to
love me
abu abdallah 
 small king abdailah is the tribute
and poor the comfort which can be offered
by a solitary follower to him who had the
affection tens thousands his words
cannot find a shelter for that royal head
so lately o'er canopied by splendid palace
roof nor make the contrast tolerable between
this wild solitude and the million glories 
the alhambra
 abdil the devotion one whose devotion
has stood the test adversity is 
nobler praise and price than the countless
and clamorous asseverations those who
crowd around the footsteps a throne i
have learnt to estimate the value liphomage
the blast winter shook me
from the tree and i lay a dead leaf at the
foot those who had worshipped my green
and flourishing days they passed by either
 minor morals
silently or scornfully and some them indulged
in bitter insult as they passed what
thought what wish can be left said i but
to rot into clay and become insensible to
spurning and contumely but the voice 
allah said arise and i arose freshened
by the waters sorrow and now what
is the worst that can befall me some
heavier blow but there is no heavier
blow he who hath lost a crown hath little
else to lose
 more honoured in thy falling than thy
rising said abdil but abdallah stopped the
sentence
 no words adulation now but we
must rejoin our friends and followers
abdallah and abdil wended their way
with a firm step towards the remnant few and
faithful their companions the sadness
abu abdallah 
that had clouded the brow the king
was gone and as he uttered courage
friends our exile is to the land our
forefathers they followed him cheerfully
to the mediterranean shore

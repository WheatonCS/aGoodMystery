my lord
when an author is desirous prefixing
an illustrious name to his titlepage it
has usually been thought proper late to
solicit the permission i who never ask anything
 any man would least all ask this 
and were it peradventure in my hands i
should be apt to let it drop out them long
before you were in possession power you
will remember i prognosticated it from the
aspect the times i clearly saw the necessity
 your becoming more than a man rank or
vi dedication
even genius your excellency will correct
the faults and inasmuch as sagacity integrity
firmness and moderation can do it will compensate
for the iniquities and atrocities six
centuries you will unite great britain and
ireland which our princes and parliaments
until now have never wisely planned nor
honestly intended
with the high respect due to your excellency
from every friend peace and justice in
both countries
i am

he who opens these letters for a history 
the times will be disappointed did he find
it in a montague's or a walpole and yet
perhaps he ran over them with pleasure if
he cannot do the same here if he regrets that
many are wanting pericles let him take comfort
in learning by heart the two first years
 thucydides and in repeating as he walks
along the sterling and strenuous orations they
contain it is easy to throw pieces history
into letters many have done it but there is
no species composition so remote from verisimilitude
who can imagine to himself a
vil advertisement
couple correspondents sitting down for such
a purpose and never turning their eyes toward
any other object better stand on the fragments
 antiquity and look about us
it was difficult to avoid every expression and
every thought attributed to pericles by the
ancients and particularly in composing the
orations yet this has been done the longer
 them which he might be conceived to have
spoken on many occurrences as general and
statesman have been omitted

pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleon
cleon i write from athens i hasten to
meet your reproaches and to stifle them in my
embrace it was wrong to have left miletus at
all it was wrong to have parted from you
without entrusting you with my secret no
no neither was wrong i have withstood many
tears my sweet cleon but never your's you
could always do what you would with me and
i should have been windbound by you on the
vol i b
 pericles and aspasia
meander as surely and inexorably as the fleet
at aulis by diana
ionia is far more beautiful than attica miletus
than athens for about athens there is
no verdure no spacious and full and flowing
river few gardens many olivetrees so many
indeed that we seem to be in an eternal cloud
 dust however when the seabreezes blow
this tree itself looks beautiful it looks in its
pliable and undulating branches irresolute as
ariadne when she was urged to fly and pale as
orythyia when she was borne away
cleone to aspasia
come out aspasia from among those olives
you would never have said a word about any
pericles and aspasia 
such things at such a time unless you had
met with an adventure when you want to
hide somewhat you always run into the thickets
 poetry pray leave ariadne with bacchus
she cannot be safer and orythyia with boreas
if you have any reverence for the mysteries 
the gods now i have almost a mind to say
tell me nothing at all what has happened to
you since you left us this would punish you
as you deserve for you know that you are dying
to tell it the venerable and goodnatured old
widow epimedea will have trouble enough i
foresee with her visiter from asia the milesian
kid will overleap her gardenwall and
browse and butt everywhere i take it as a
matter certainty that you are with her for i
never heard you mention any other relative in
athens and she was i remember the guest 
your house how she loved you dear good
woman she would have given your father
b 
 pericles and aspasia
antiochus all her wealth for you but when
you were seven years old you were worth seven
times over what you are now i loved you then
myself well i am resolved to relieve you 
your secret
prodigal scattered precious hopes and 
smiles that seem to rise from the interest you
feel and not from the interest you excite what
victim have you crowned with flowers and selected
to fall at your altar 
aspasia to cleone
spirit divination how dared you find me
out and how dared you accuse me 
you who poetic more extravagantly
yourself mine i do insist upon it is no
pericles and aspasia 
worse than we girls in general are apt to
write and no better you will reply than
we now and then are condemned to hasten to
or disposed to read
poetry is the weightless integument that our
butterflies always shed in our path ere they
wing their way toward us it is precisely 
the same form colour and substance for the
whole generation are all mine well and all
yours i shall be very angry to hear that
mine are if they do not weep and look wan
and sicken why then i must out very spite
but may the gods in their wisdom keep not
only their hearts but their persons too just
where they are i intend to be in love here at
athens it is true i do assure you when i
have time and idleness and courage for it
ay ay now your eyes are running over all
the rest the letter well what have you
found where is the place i will keep you
b pericles and aspasia
in suspense no longer as soon as there was
any light at all we discovered on the hill above
the city crowds people and busy preparations
you are come to it
aspasia to cleone
i was determined to close my letter when
your curiosity was at the highest that you
might flutter and fall from the clouds like
icarus i wanted two things first that you
should bite your lip an attitude in which you
alone look pretty and secondly that you should
say half angrily this now is exactly like
aspasia i will be remembered and i will
make you look just as i would have you
how fortunate to have arrived at athens at
pericles and aspasia 
dawn on the th elaphebolion on this
day begin the festivals bacchus and the
theatre is thrown open at sunrise
what a theatre what an elevation what a
prospect city and port land and water
 porticos and temples men and heroes 
demigods and gods 
it was indeed my wish and intention when
i left ionia to be present at the first the
dionysius but how rarely are wishes and
intentions so accomplished even when winds
and waters do not interfere 
i will now tell you all no time was to be
lost so i hastened on shore in the dress an
athenian boy who came over with his mother
from lemnos in the giddiness youth he
forgot to tell me that not being yet eighteen
years old he could not be admitted and left
me on the steps my heart sank within me so
many young men stared and whispered yet
pericles and aspasia
never was stranger treated with more civility
crowded as the theatre was for the tragedy
had begun every one made room for me
when they were seated and i too i looked
towards the stage and behold there lay before
me but afar off bound upon a rock a
more majestical form and bearing a countenance
more heroic i should rather say more
divine than ever my imagination had conceived 
 know not how long it was before i discovered
that as many eyes were directed towards me as
towards the competitor the gods i was
neither flattered by it nor abashed every wish
hope sigh sensation was successively with the
champion the human race with his antagonist
jove and his creator eschylus how
often o cleon have we throbbed with his injuries
 how often hath his vulture torn our
breasts how often have we thrown our arms
around each other's neck and halfrenounced
pericles and aspasia 
the religion our fathers even your image
so inseparable at other times came not across
me then prometheus stood between us he
had resisted in silence and disdain the cruellest
tortures that almightiness could inflict and
now arose the nymphs ocean which heaved
its vast waves before us and now they descended
with open arms and sweet benign
countenances and spake with pity and the
insurgent heart was mollified and quelled
i sobbed dropt
cleone to aspasia
is this telling me all you faithless creature 
there is much to be told when aspasia faints
in the theatre and aspasia in disguise 
b 
 pericles and aspasia
my sweet and dear aspasia with all your
beauty which you cannot but be conscious
how is it possible you could have hoped to be
undetected certainly there never was any
woman or any man so little vain as you are
formerly you were rather so about your poetry 
but now you really write it well you have overcome
this weakness nay you doubt whether
your best verses are tolerable you have told
me this several times and you always say what
you think unless when any one might be hurt
or displeased i am glad the observation comes
across me for i must warn you upon it
take care then aspasia do not leave off
entirely all dissimulation it is as feminine a
virtue and as necessary to a woman as religion
if you are without it you will have a
grace the less and what you could worse spare
a sigh the more
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
i was not quite well when i wrote to you
when i am not quite well i must always write
to you i am better after it
where did i leave off
ah cleon cleon i have learnt your
lesson i am dissembling it must not be with
you my tears are falling i acted unworthily
and are these tears indeed for my fault against
you i cannot tell if i could i would candidly
every thing that has happened everything
that shall happen hereafter i will lay
upon your knees counsel me direct me
even were i as sensible as you are i should
not be able to discover my own faults the
clearest eyes do not see the cheeks below nor
the brow above them
to proceed then in my narrative everything
appeared to me an illusion but the tram
pericles and aspasia
gey what was divine seemed human and
what was human seemed divine
an apparition resplendent and unearthly
beauty threw aside with his slender arms the
youths philosophers magistrates and generals
that surrounded me with a countenance as confident
a motion as rapid and a command as
unresisted as a god
stranger said he i come from pericles
to offer you my assistance
i looked in his face it was a child's
we have attendants here who shall conduct
you from the crowd said he
venus and cupid cried one
we are dogs growled another
worse rejoined a third we are slaves
happy man happy man if thou art
theirs whispered the next in his ear and followed
us close behind
i have since been informed that pericles who
sate below us on the first seat was the only man
pericles and aspasia 
who did not rise no matter why should he 
why did the rest but it was very kind in him
to send his cousin i mean it was very kind
for so proud a man
epimedea wept over me when i entered her
house and burned incense before the gods and
led me into my chamber
i have a great deal to say to you my dear
aspasia but you must go to sleep your bath
shall be ready at noon but be sure you sleep
till then said she
i did indeed sleep and will you believe it 
instantly and soundly never was bath more
refreshing never was reproof more gentle than
epimedea's
i found her at my pillow when i awoke and
she led me to the marble conch
dear child said she when i had stept in
you do not know our customs you should
have come at once to my house you never
should have worn men's clothes indeed you
 pericles and aspasia
should not have gone to the theatre at all
but being there and moreover in men's habiliments
you should have taken care not to have
fainted as they say you did my husband
thessaly would never hear fainting he
used to tell me it was a bad example but he
fainted at last poor man and i minded his
admonition why what a lovely child you are
grown my little aspasia is the bath too hot 
aspasia can it be why you are no child
at all 
i really do believe that this idle discourse 
epimedea which will tire you perhaps was the
only one that would not have wearied out my
spirits it neither made me think nor answer
what a privilege what a blessing how seldom
to be enjoyed in our conferences with the silly
ah do not let me wrong the kindhearted
epimedea those are not silly who have found
the way to our hearts and far other names do
they deserve who open to us theirs
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
the boy about whom i wrote to you in my
letter yesterday is called alcibiades he
alcibiades had no right to be at the theatre but
he might have been sent for on the occasion or have
taken the liberty to come in hearing a bustle for
there was nobody in athens whom he feared or cared
for either in his childhood or after thucydides calls
alcibiades a youth in the twelfth year the peloponnesian
war nine years after the death pericles
alcibiades was on the mother's side grandson 
miracles whose granddaughter isidore married
cimon her father euryptolemus was cousingermain
 pericles it is impossible that men so prudent
and welltempered as pericles and cimon the
two most perfect models a gentleman that ever
existed upon earth could have been enemies they
headed two opposite parties and conscientiously on
this principle thessaly son cimon was the accuser
 his cousin alcibiades
the leaders in athens looked beyond and over their
 pericles and aspasia
lisps and blushes at it his cousin pericles
you may have heard enjoys the greatest power
and reputation both as an orator and a general
 any man in athens early this morning the
beautiful child came to visit me and told me that
when his cousin had finished his studies which
he usually had done about three hours after
sunrise he would desire him to come also
i replied by no means do it my beautiful
and brave protector surely on considering
the matter you will think you are taking too
great a liberty with a person so distinguished
i take no liberties with any other said he
when i expressed in my countenance a little
surprise at his impetuosity he came forward
and kissed my brow then said he more
submissively pardon my rudeness i like
very well to be told what to do by those who
are fond me but never to be told what not
own families dangerous precedent laudably avoided
by popular statesmen since
pericles and aspasia 
to do and the more fond they are me the
less i like it because when they tell me what
to do they give me an opportunity pleasing
them but when they tell me what not to do it is
a sign that i have displeased or am likely to displease
them besides i believe there are some
other reasons but they have quite escaped me
it is time i should return said he or i
shall forget all about the hour his studies
i mean pericles and mine too
i would not let him go however but inquired
who were his teachers and repeated to
him many things from sappho and alcaeus
and pindar and simonides he was amazed
and told me he preferred them to fate and necessity
python and pythonissa
i could now have kissed him in my turn but
he drew back thinking no doubt that i was
treating him like a child that a kiss is never
given but as the price pardon and that i
had pardoned him before for his captiousness
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
aspasia i foresee that henceforward you will
admire the tragedy prometheus more than
ever but do not tell any one excepting so
fond a friend as cleon that you prefer the
author to homer i agree with you that the
conception such a drama is in itself a stupendous
effort genius that the execution is
equal to the conception that the character 
prometheus is more heroick than any in heroick
poetry and that no production the same
extent is so magnificent and so exalted but
the iliad is not a region it is a continent and
you might as well compare this prodigy to it as
the cataract the nile to the ocean in the
one we are overpowered by the compression
and burst the element in the other we are
pericles and aspasia 
carried over an immensity space bounding
the earth not bounded by her and having nothing
above but the heavens
let us enjoy whenever we have an opportunity
the delight admiration and perform
the duties reverence may others hate
what is admirable we will hate likewise o
my aspasia when we can do no better i am
unable to foretell the time when this shall
happen it lies i think beyond the calculations
 seton
i am happy to understand that the athenians
have such a philosopher among them hitherto
we have been inclined to suppose that philosophy
at athens is partly an intricate tissue 
subtile questions and illusory theories knotted
with syllogisms and partly an indigested mass
 unexamined assertions and conflicting dogmas
the loans are more silent contemplative
and recluse knowing that nature
 pericles and aspasia
will not deliver her oracles in the crowd nor
by sound trumpet they open their breasts
to her in solitude with the simplicity 
children and look earnestly in her face for a
reply meton and democritus and anaxagoras
may perhaps lay their hands upon the
leaping your tettinxes and moderate their
chirping but i apprehend that the genius 
the people will always repose upon the windskins
 the sophists comedy might be their
corrector but comedy seems to think she has
two offices to perform from one side the
stage to explode absurdity and from the other
to introduce indecency she might under wise
regulations and these she should impose upon
herself render more service to a state than
philosophy could in whatsoever other character
and i wonder that aristophanes so
strong in the poetical faculty and unrivalled in
critical acuteness should not perceive that a
pericles and aspasia 
dominion is within his reach which is within the
reach no mortal beside a dominion whereby
he may reform the manners dictate the pursuits
and regulate the affections his countrymen
perhaps he never could have done it so
effectually had he been better and begun otherwise
 but having however unworthy might have
been the means and methods seized upon their
humours they now are as pliable to him as
waxen images to tressilian witches he keeps
them before the fire he has kindled and he has
only to sing the right song
beware my dear aspasia never to offend
him he holds more terrors at his command
than eschylus the tragic poet rolls the
thunder that frightens the comic wields the
lightning that kills aristophanes has the
power tossing you among the populace a
thousand cities for a thousand years
 pericles and aspasia
a great poet is more powerful than sesostris
and a wicked one more formidable than palais
aspasia to cleone
epimedea has been with me in my chamber
she asked me whether the women ionia had
left off wearing earrings i answered that i believed
they always had worn them and that they
were introduced by the persians who had received
them from nations more remote
and do you think yourself too young said
she for such an ornament producing at
the same instant a massy pair inlaid with the
largest emeralds alas alas said she
your mother neglected you strangely there
pericles and aspasia 
is no hole in the ear right or left we can
mend that however i know a woman who will
bring us the prettiest little pan charcoal with
the prettiest little steel rod in it and before
you can cry out one ear lets light through
these are yours said she and so shall everything
be house garden quails leveret
generous epimedea said i do not say
things that pain me i will accept a part the
present i will wear these beautiful emeralds on
one arm thinking nailing them in my
ears you resolved to make me steady but i am
unwilling they should become dependencies 
attica
all our young women wear them the
goddesses too
the goddesses are in the right said i 
their ears are marble but i do not believe
any one them would tell us that women were
 pericles and aspasia
made to be the settings pearls and emeralds

i had taken one and was about to kiss her
when she said do not leave me an odd earring
 put the other in the hair
epimedea said i i have made a vownever
to wear on the head any thing but one
single flower one single wheatear green or
yellow and ivy or vineleaves the number 
these are not mentioned in the vow
rash child said epimedea shaking her
head i never made but two vows one w as
when i took a husband
and the other epimedea 
no matter said she it might be for
what i know never to do the like again
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
pericles has visited me after many grave
and gentle inquiries often suspended all relating
to my health and after praises miletus
and pity for my friends left behind he
told me that when he was quite assured my
perfect recovery from the fatigues the voyage
he hoped i would allow him to collect from meat
my leisurehours the information he wanted
on the literature ionia simplehearted man 
in praising the authors our country he
showed me that he knew them perfectly from
first to last and now indeed his energy was
displayed i thought he had none at all with
how sonorous and modulated a voice did he
repeat fire more poetical passages our elder
vol i c
 pericles and aspasia
historians and how his whole soul did lean
upon herodotus happily for me he observed
not my enthusiasm and now he brought me
into the presence homer we claim him
said he but he is yours observe with what
partiality he always dwells on asia how
infinitely more civilized are glaucus and sarpedon
than any the grecians he was called
upon to celebrate priam paris hector
what polished men civilisation has never
made a step in advance and never will on
those countries she had gone so far in the days
 homer he keeps helen pretty rigorously out
 sight but he opens his heart to the virtues 
andromache what a barbarian is the son
 a goddess minerva must seize him by the
hair to avert the murder his leader but at
the eloquence the phrygian king the storm
 the intractable homicide bursts in tears
 and eschylus said i but could not conpericles
and aspasia 
tine blushes rose into my cheek and pained
me at the recollection my weakness
he has left us said pericles who perceived
it but pretended not i am grieved
that my prayers were inadequate to detain him
but what prayers or what expostulations can
influence the lofty mind labouring and heaving
under injustice and indignity eschylus knew
he merited both by his genius and his services
the gratitude and admiration the athenians
he saw others preferred before him and hoisted
sail at the rumour his departure such was
the consternation as if the shield minerva in
the parthenon had dropt from her breast upon
the pavement that glory shines now upon
the crown hiero which hath sunk for
athens
you have still great treasures left said i 
for he was moved
true replied he but will not every one
c 
 pericles and aspasia
remark who hears the observation that we
know not how to keep them and have never
weighed them 
i sate silent he resumed his serenity
we ought to change places said he at
the feet the poets eschylus i see is yours 
homer is mine aspasia should be a pallas to
achilles and pericles a subordinate power
comforting and consoling the afflicted demigod
impetuosity impatience resentment revenge
itself are pardonable sins in the very softest 
your sex on brave endurance rises our admiration

 i love those better who endure with constancy
said i
happy replied he thrice happy o
aspasia the constancy thus tried and thus rewarded

he spoke with tenderness he rose with majesty
bowed to epimedea touched gently
pericles and aspasia 
scarcely at all the hand i presented to him
bent over it and departed
aspasia to cleone
i told you i would love o cleon but i am
so near it that i dare not
tell me what i am to do i can do any thing
but write and think
pericles has not returned
i am nothing here in athens
five days are over six almost
o what long days are these elaphebolion 
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
take heed aspasia all orators are deceivers
 and pericles is the greatest orators
i will write nothing more lest you should
attend in preference to any other part my
letter
yes i must repeat my admonition i must
speak out plainly i must try other words 
stronger more frightful love supremacy
miscalled political glory finds most and leaves
all dishonest
the gods and goddesses watch over and
preserve you and send you safe home again 
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
fear not for me cleon pericles has attained
the summit glory and the wisdom
and virtue that acquired it for him are my
sureties
a great man knows the value greatness 
he dares not hazard it he will not squander it
imagine you that the confidence and affection
 a people so acute so vigilant so jealous as
the athenians would have rested so firmly and
constantly on one inconstant and infirm 
if he loves me the merit is not mine the
fault will be if he ceases
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
i must and will fear for you and the more
because i perceive that you are attracted as the
bees are by an empty sound the fame your
admirer you love pericles for that very quality
which ought to have set you on your guard
against him in contentions for power the
philosophy and the poetry life are dropped
and trodden down domestic affections can no
more bloom and flourish in the hardened racecourse
 politics than flowers can find nourishment
in the pavement the streets in the
politician the whole creature is factitious if
ever he speaks as before he speaks either from
memory or invention
but such is your beauty such your genius
it may alter the nature things endowed
pericles and aspasia 
with the power circe you will exert it appositely
and restore to the most selfish and most
voracious animals the uprightness and dignity
 man
pericles to aspasia
it is not wisdom in itself o aspasia it is
the manner imparting it that affects the soul
and alone deserves the name eloquence i
have never been moved by any but yours
is it the beauty that shines over it is it the
voice that ripens it giving it those lovely
colours that delicious freshness is it the modesty
and diffidence with which you present it
to us looking for nothing but support sufficient
were any one them singly but all
c 
 pericles and aspasia
united have come forward to subdue me and
have deprived me my courage my selfpossession
and my repose
i dare not hope to be beloved aspasia i
did hope it once in my life and have been disappointed
where i sought for happiness none
is offered me i have neither the sunshine nor
the shade
if then i was so unfortunate in earlier days
ought i ten years later to believe that she to
whom the earth with whatever is beautiful and
graceful in it bows prostrate will listen to meas
her lover i dare not too much have i
dared already but if o aspasia i should
sometimes seem heavy and dull in conversation
when happier men surround you pardon my
infirmity
i have only one wish i may not utter it i
have only one fear this at least is not irrational
and i will own it the fear that aspasia
could never be sufficiently happy with me
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to pericles
do you doubt o pericles that i shall be
sufficiently happy with you this doubt 
yours assures me that i shall be
i throw aside my pen to crown the gods
and i worship thee first o pallas who protected
the life enlightened the mind establish
est the power and exalted the glory 
pericles
cleone to aspasia
i tremble both for you and your lover the
people athens may applaud at first the
 pericles and aspasia
homage paid to beauty and genius nevertheless
there are many whose joy will spring from malignity
and who will exult at what they think
i know not whether quite unjustly a weakness
in pericles
i shall always be restless about you let
me confess to you i do not like your sheer democracies
what are they good for why
yes they have indeed their use the filth and
ferment the compost are necessary for raising
rare plants
o how i wish we were again together in that
island on our river which we called the fortunate
t it was almost an island when your
father cut across the isthmus about ten paces
to preserve the swannest
xeniades has left miletus we know not
whither he is gone but we presume to his
mines in lemnos it was always with difficulty
he could be persuaded to look after his affairs
pericles and aspasia 
he is too rich too young too thoughtless but
since you left miletus we have nothing here to
detain him
i wish i could trifle with you about your
pericles any wager upon it he is the only
lover who never wrote verses upon you
in a politician a verse is an ostracism
aspasia to cleone
my pericles mine mine he is has written
verses upon me not many nor worth his
prose even the shortest sentence it but
you will read them with pleasure for their
praises miletus
no longer ago than yesterday an ugly young
philosopher declared his passion for me as you
 pericles and aspasia
shall see i did not write any thing back to
pericles i did to the other i will not run
the risk having half my letter left unread by
you in your hurry to come into the poetry
here it all is
pericles to aspasia
flower ionia's fertile plains
where pleasure leagued with virtue reigns
where the pierian maids old
yea long ere ilion's tale was told
too pure too sacred for our sight
descended with the silent night
to young arctinus and meander
delay'd his course for alexander 
if there be city on the earth
proud in the children her birth
wealth science beauty story song
these to miletus all belong
to fix the diadem on his brow
for ever one was wanting thou
pericles and aspasia 
i could not be cruel to such a suitor even if
he asked me for pity love makes one half 
every man foolish and the other half cunning
pericles touched me on the side miletus and
socrates came up to me straightforward from
prometheus
socrates to aspasia

he who stole fire from heaven
long heav'd his bold and patient breast twas riven
by the caucasian bird and bolts jove
stolen that fire have 
and am enchain'd to die
by every jealous power that frowns above

i call not upon thee again
to hear my vows and calm my pain
who fittest high enthron'd
where venus rolls her gladsome star
propitious love but thou disown'd
 pericles and aspasia
by sire and mother whosoe'er they are
unblest in form and name despair 
why dost thou follow that bright demon why
his purest altar art thou always nigh 
i was sorry that socrates should suffer so
much for me
pardon the fib cleon let it pass i was
sorry just as we all are upon such occasions
and wrote him this consolation

o thou who fittest with the wise
and searches higher lore
and openest regions to their eyes
unvisited before 
i'd run to loose thee if i cou'd
nor let the vulture taste thy blood
but pity pity attic bee 
tis happiness forbidden me
pericles and aspasia 

despair is not for good or wise
and should not be for love 
we all must bear our destinies
and bend to those above
birds flying o'er the stormy seas
alight upon their proper trees
yet wisest men not always know
where they should stop or whither go
aspasia to cleone
i am quite ashamed alcibiades quite
angry with him what do you imagine he has
been doing he listened to my conversation
with pericles on the declaration love from
the philosopher bound and afterwards to the
 pericles and aspasia
verses i repeated in answer to his which pleased
my pericles extremely not perhaps for themselves
but because i had followed his advice in
writing them and had returned to him with the
copy so speedily
alcibiades said he did not like them at all
and could write better himself we smiled at
this and his cousin said do then my
boy 
would you believe it he not only wrote but
i fear for he declares he did actually sent
these 
o satyrson sophroniscus 
would alton cut me an hibiscus
i'd wield it as the goatherds do
and swing thee a sound stroke or two
bewilder if thou canst us boys
us or the sophists with thy toys
thy kalokagathons beware 
keep to the good and leave the fair
pericles and aspasia 
could he really be the composer what think
you or did he get any his wicked friends to
help him the verses are very bold very
scandalous very shocking i am vexed and
sorry but what can be done we must seem
to know nothing about the matter
the audacious little creature not very little
he is within three fingers my height is half
in love with me he flames up at the mention
 socrates can he be jealous 
pericles tells me that the philosophers here
are as susceptible malice as love it maybe
so for the plants which are sweet in some
places are acrid in others
he said to me smiling i shall be represented
in their schools as a sophist because
aspasia and alcibiades were unruly o that
boy who knows but his mischievous verses will
be a reason sufficient in another year why i
 pericles and aspasia
am unable to command an army or harangue
an assembly the people 
xeniades to aspasia
aspasia aspasia have you forgotten me 
have you forgotten us our childhood was
one our earliest youth was undivided why
would you not see me did you fear that you
should have to reproach me for any fault i have
committed this would have pained you formerly
 ah how lately 
your absence not absence flight has
broken my health and left me fever and frenzy
eumenides is certain i can only recover my health
by composure foolish man as if composure
pericles and aspasia 
were more easy to recover than health was
there ever such a madman as to say you drill
never have the use your urbs again unless
you walk and run 
i am weary advice remonstrance 
pity every thing above all life
was it anger how dared i be angry with
you that withheld me from imploring the
sight you was it pride alas what pride
is left me i am preferred no longer i am
rejected scorned loathed was it always so
well may i ask the question for every thing
seems uncertain to me but my misery at
times i know not whether i am mad or dreaming
no no aspasia the past was a dream
the present is a reality the mad and the
dreaming do not shed tears as i do and yet
in these bitter tears are my happiest moments 
and some angry demon knows it and presses
my temples that there shall fall but few
 pericles and aspasia
you refused to admit me i asked too little
and deserved the refusal come to me this
you will not refuse unless you are bowed to
slavery go tell your despot this vith my
curses and defiance
i am calmer but insist spare yourself aspasia
one tear and not by an effort but by a
duty
aspasia to xeniades
i am pained to my innermost heart that you
are ill
pericles is not the person you imagine him
behold his billet and cannot you think 
me with equal generosity 
true we saw much each other in our
pericles and aspasia 
childhood and many childish things we did
together this is the reason why i went out
 your way as much as i could afterwards
there is another too i hoped you would love
more the friend that i love most how much
happier would she make you than the flighty
aspasia we resemble each other too much
xeniades we should never have been happy
so illmated nature hates these alliances 
they are like those brother and sister i
never loved any one but pericles none else
attracts the admiration the world i stand
o xeniades not only above slavery but above
splendour in that serene light which homer
describes as encompassing the happy on olympus
i will come to visit you within the hour 
be calm be contented love me but not too
much xeniades 
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to pericles
xeniades whom i loved a little in my childhood
and do not look serious now my dearest
pericles a very little afterwards is sadly ill
he was always i know not how extravagant in
his wishes although not so extravagant as many
others and what do you imagine he wishes
now he wishes but he is very ill so ill he
cannot rise from his bed that i would go and
visit him i wonder whether it would be quite
considerate i am half inclined to go if you
approve it
poor youth he grieves me bitterly
i shall not weep before him i have wept so
much here indeed indeed i wept my pericles
only because i had written too unkindly
pericles and aspasia 
pericles to aspasia
do what your heart tells you yes aspasia
do all it tells you remember how august it
is it contains the temple not only love
but conscience and a whisper is heard from
the extremity the one to the extremity 
the other
bend in pensiveness even in sorrow on the
flowery bank youth whereunto runs the
stream that passes irreversibly let the garland
drop into it let the hand be refreshed
by it but may the beautiful feet aspasia
stand firm 
vol i
 pericles and aspasia
xeniades to aspasia
you promised you would return i thought
you only broke hearts not promises
it is now broad daylight i see it clearly
although the blinds are closed a long sharp
ray cuts off one corner the room and we
shall hear the crash presently
come but without that pale silent girl i
hate her place her on the other side you
not on mine
and this planetree gives no shade whatever
we will sit in some other place
no no i will not have you call her to us
let her play where she is the notes are low 
she plays sweetly
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to pericles
see what incoherency he did not write it
not one word the slave who brought it told
me that he was desired by the guest to write
his orders whenever he found his mind composed
enough to give any
about four hours after my departure he
called him mildly and said i am quite recovered

he gave no orders however and spake nothing
more for some time at last he raised
himself up and rested on his elbow and began
said the slave like one inspired the slave
added that finding he was indeed quite well
again both in body and mind and capable 
making as fine poetry as any man in athens
he had written down every word with the greatest
d 
 pericles and aspasia
punctuality and that looking at him for more
he found he had fallen into as sound a slumber
as a reaper's
upon this i ran off with the verses
said he
pericles to aspasia
tears o aspasia do not dwell long upon
the cheeks youth rain drops easily from
the bud rests on the bosom the maturer
flower and breaks down that one only which
hath lived its day
weep and perform the offices friendship
the season life leading you by the hand
will not permit you to linger at the tomb 
the departed and xeniades when your first
pericles and aspasia 
tear fell upon it entered into the number 
the blessed
aspasia to cleone
what shall i say to you tender and sweet
cleon the wanderer is in the haven happiness
 the restless has found rest
weep not i have shed all your tears not
all they burst from me again
cleone to aspasia
o he was too beautiful to live is there
any thing that shoots through the world so
 pericles and aspasia
swiftly as a sunbeam opiates has told me
every thing he sailed back without waiting
at the islands by your orders he says
what hopes could i with any prudence entertain
the chaplet you threw away would
have cooled and adorned my temples but how
could he ever love another who had once loved
you i am casting my broken thoughts before
my aspasia the little shells upon the shore
that the storm has scattered there and that feet
have trampled on
i have prayed to venus but i never prayed
her to turn toward me the fondness that was
yours i fancied i even hoped you might accept
it and my prayer was grant i may
never love afar from me o goddess bethe
malignant warmth that dries up the dews
 friendship
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
pericles has insisted on it that i should
change the air and has recommended to me an
excursion to the borders the state
if you pass them a little way said he
you will come to tanagra and that will inflame
you with ambition
the honour in which i hold the name 
corinna induced me to undertake a journey to
her native place never have i found a people
so hospitable as the inhabitants living at a
distance from the sea they are not traders nor
adventurers nor speculators nor usurers but
cultivate a range pleasant hills covered with
vines mercury is the principal god they worship
 yet i doubt whether a single prayer was
 pericles and aspasia
ever offered up to him by a tanagra for success
in thievery
the beauty corinna is no less celebrated
than her poetry i remarked that the women
speak it with great exultation while the men
applaud her genius and i asked my venerable
host agesilaus how he could account for it 
i can account for nothing that you ladies
do said he although i have lived amongst
you seventyfive years i only know that it was
exactly the contrary while she was living we
youths were rebuked when we talked about her
beauty and the rebuke was only softened by
the candid confession that she was clever in
her ways
come back with me to athens o agesi
laus said i and we will send aristophanes
to tanagra
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
i have been reading all the poetry corinna
that i could collect certainly it is better than
hesiod's or even than myrtis's who taught
her and pindar not the rudiments the art
for this is the only art in which the rudiments
are incommunicable but what was good what
was bad in her verses why it was so and
how she might correct the worse and improve
the better
hesiod who is also a boeotian is admirable
for the purity his life and soundness his
precepts but there is hardly a trace poetry
in his ploughed field
i find in all his writings but one verse worth
transcribing and that only for the melody
in a soft meadow and on vernal flowers
d
 pericles and aspasia
i do not wonder he was opposed to homer
what an advantage to the enemies greatness
that is to mankind to be able to match
one so low against one so lofty 
the greek army before troy would have
been curious to listen to a dispute between
agamemnon and achilles but would have been
transported with ecstasy to have been present
at one between the king men and thersites

there are few who possess all the poetry 
any voluminous author i doubt whether there
are ten families in athens in which all the
plays eschylus are preserved many keep
what pleases them most few consider that
every page a really great poet has something
in it which distinguishes him from an inferior
order something which if insubstantial as the
aliment serves at least as a solvent to the aliment
 strong and active minds
pericles and aspasia 
i asked my pericles what he thought 
hesiod
i think myself more sagacious said he
hesiod found out that half was more than all 
i have found out that one is
aspasia to cleone
a slave brought to me this morning an
enormous load papers as many as he could
carry under both arms they are treatises by
the most celebrated philosophers some hours
afterwards when the sun was declining pericles
came in and asked me if i had examined
or looked over any portion them i told him
i had opened those only which bore the superscription
 famous names but that unless he
 pericles and aspasia
would assist me i was hopeless reconciling
one part with another in the same writers
the first thing requisite said i is that
as many as are now at athens should meet together
and agree upon a nomenclature terms
from definitions we may go on to propositions 
but we cannot make a step unless the foot rests
somewhere
he smiled at me ah my aspasia said
he philosophy does not bring her sons together
 she portions them off early gives them a
scanty stock wormeaten furniture a chair or
two on which it is dangerous to sit down and
at least as many arms as utensils then leaves
them they seldom meet afterwards
but could not they be brought together by
some friend the mother said i laughing
aspasia i answered he you have lived
but few years in the world and with only one
philosopher yourself
pericles and aspasia 
i will not be contented with a compliment
said i and least all from you explain
to me the opinions those about you
he traced before me the divergencies ol
every sect from our countryman thales to
those now living epimedea sat with her eyes
wide open listening attentively when he went
away i asked her what she thought his
discourse she half closed her eyes not from
weariness but as many do on bringing out 
obscurity into light a notable discovery and
laying her forefinger on my arm you have
turned his head said she he will do no
longer he used to be plain and coherent and
now did ever mortal talk so widely i could
not understand one word in twenty and what
i could understand was sheer nonsense
sweet epimedea said i this is what i
should fancy to be no such easy matter
ah you are growing like him already
 pericles and aspasia
said she i should not be surprised to find
some morning a cupola at the top this pretty
head
pericles i think i never told you has a
little elevation on the crown his i should
rather say his head has a crown others have
none
cleone to aspasia
do my dear aspasia continue to write tome
about the poets and if you think there is
any thing myrtis or corinna which is wanting
to us at miletus copy it out i do not
approve the prologues nothing can be
more tiresome hardly any thing more wicked 
than many them it may be well occa
pericles and aspasia 
signally to give something the historical
form to the dramatic as it is occasionally to
give something the dramatic to the historical
 but never to turn into ridicule and buffoonery
the virtuous the unfortunate or the
brave whatever the athenians may boast 
their exquisite judgment their delicate perceptions
this is a perversion intellect in its
highest place unworthy a thracian there
are many bad tragedies both eschylus and
sophocles but none without beauties few
without excellencies i tremble then at your
doubt in another century it may be impossible
to find a collection the whole unless
some learned and rich man like pericles or
some protecting king like hiero should preserve
them in his library
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
prudently have you considered how to preserve
all valuable authors the cedar doors 
a royal library fly open to receive them ay
there they vill be safe and untouched
hiero is however no barbarian he deserves
a higher station than a throne and he
is raised to it the protected have placed the
protector where neither the malice men nor
the power gods can reach him beyond
time above fate
pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
from the shortness your last i am quite
certain that you are busy for me in looking out
pieces verse if you cannot find any 
myrtis or corinna you may do what is better 
you may compose a panegyric on all our sex
who have excelled in poetry this will earn
for you the same good office when the world
shall produce another aspasia
having been in boeotia you must also know
a great deal more pindar than we do write
about any them they all interest me and
my mind has need exercise it is still too
fond throwing itself down on one place
pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleaned
and so cleon you wish me to write a
eulogy on myrtis and corinna and all the
other poetesses that ever lived and this is for
the honour our sex ah cleon no
studied eulogy does honour to any one it is
always considered and always ought to be
as a piece pleading in which the pleader
says every thing the most in favour his
client in the most graceful and impressive
manner he can there is a city greece i
hear in which reciprocal flattery is so necessary
that whenever a member the assembly
dies his successor is bound to praise him before
he takes the vacant seat
i do not speak this from my own knowledge 
indeed i could hardly believe in such frivolity
pericles and aspasia 
until i asked pericles if it were true or rather
if there were any foundation at all for the
report
perfectly true said he but the citizens
 this city are now become our allies therefore
do not curl your lip or i must uncurl it
being an archon
myrtis and corinna have no need me
to read and recommend their works to point
out their beauties and defects is praise enough
how methinks you exclaim to point
out defects is that praising
yes cleon if with equal good faith and
accuracy you point out their beauties too it
is only thus a fair estimate can be made and
it is only by such fair estimate that a writer
can be exalted to his proper station if you
toss up the scale too high it descends again
rapidly below its equipoise what it contains
drops out and people catch at it scatter it and
lose it
 pericles and aspasia
we not only are inclined to indulge in rather
more than a temperate heat what we would
persuade ourselves is very wholesome severity
towards the living but even to peer sometimes
into the tomb with a wolfish appetite for an
unpleasant odour
we must patronise we must pull down in
fact we must be in mischief men or women
if we are capable showing what is good in
another and neglect to do it we omit a duty 
we omit to give rational pleasure and to conciliate
right goodwill nay more we are abettors
if not aiders in the vilest fraud the fraud
 purloining from respect we are entrusted
with letters great interest what a baseness
not to deliver them 
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
it is remarkable that athens so fertile in
men genius should have produced no women
 distinction while boeotia by no means celebrated
for brightness intellect in either sex
presented to the admiration the world her
myrtis and corinna at the feet myrtis it
was that pindar gathered into his throbbing
breast the scattered seeds poetry and it
was under the smile the beautiful corinna
that he drew his inspiration and wove his immortal
crown
he never quite overcame his grandiloquence
the animals we call halfasses by a word 
the sweetest sound although not the most seducing
import he calls
the daughters the tempestfooted steeds 
pericles and aspasia
o fortune that the children so illustrious
a line should carry suckingpigs into the marketplace
and cabbagestalks out it 
cleone to aspasia
will you always leave off aspasia at the
very moment you have raised our expectations
to the highest a witticism and a sudden
spring from your seat lest we should see you
smile at it these are your ways shame upon
you are you determined to continue all your
life in making every one wish something 
pindar should not be created like ordinary
men
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
i have not treated pindar like an ordinary
man i conducted him into the library 
cleon and left him there however i would
have my smile out behind the door the verse
i quoted you may be sure is much admired
by the learned and no less by the brave and
worthy men whom he celebrates for charioteership
and other such extremities but we old
miletus have been always taught that words
should be subordinate to ideas and we never
place the pedestal on the head the statue
now do not tell any body that i have spoken
a single word in dispraise pindar men are
not too apt to admire what is admirable in their
superiors but on the contrary are very apt to
detract from them and to seize on any thing
 pericles and aspasia
which may tend to lower them pindar would
not have written so exquisitely if no fault had
ever been found with him he would have
wandered on among such inquiries as those he
began in 
shall i sing tha widespreading and noble
ismenus or the beautiful and whiteankle
belie or the glorious cadmus or the mighty
hercules or the blooming bacchus
now a poet ought to know what he is about
before he opens his lips he ought not to ask
like a poor fellow in the street good people 
what song will you have this however was
not the fault for which he was blamed by corinna
in our censures we are less apt to
consider the benefit we may confer than the
ingenuity we can display
she said pindar you have brought a sack
 corn to sow a perch land and instead
 sprinkling it about you have emptied the
sack at the first step
pericles and aspasia 
enough this reproof formed his character
it directed his beat it singled his aim
it concentrated his forces it was not by
the precepts corinna it was not by her
example it was by one witticism a wise
and lovely woman that he far excels all
other poets in disdain triviality and choice
 topics he is sometimes very tedious tous
in his long stories families but we maybe
sure he was not equally so to those who
were concerned in the genealogy we are
amused at his cleverness in saving the shoulder
 pelops from the devouring jaw a hungry
god no doubt he mends the matter nevertheless
he tires us
many prefer his dithyrambic to his olympian
isthmian pythian and nemean odes 
i do not nor is it likely that he did himself
we may well suppose that he exerted the
iiost power on the composition and the most
vol i e
 pericles and aspasia
thought on the correction the poems he
was to recite before kings and nations in
honour the victors at those solemn games
here the chorusses and bands musick were
composed the first singers and players in the
world in the others there were no performers
but such as happened to assemble on ordinary
festivals or at best at a festival bacchus
in the odes performed at the games although
there is not always perfect regularity corresponding
verse there is always enough it
to satisfy the most fastidious ear in the
dithyrambic there is no order whatsoever but
verses and halfverses every kind cemented
by vigorous and sounding prose
i do not love dances upon stilts they may
excite the applause and acclamations the
vulgar but we cleon exact the observance
 established rules and never put on slippers
however richly embroidered unless they pair
pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
we hear that between athens and syracuse
there has always been much communication
let me learn what you have been able to collect
about the ives pindar and eschylus in
sicily
is it not strange that the two most highminded
 poets should have gone to reside in a
foreign land under the dominion a king 
i am ashamed my question already such
men are under no dominion it is not in their
nature to offend against the laws or to think
about what they are or who administers them 
and they may receive a part their sustenance
from kings as well as from cows and bees
we will reproach them for emigration when
we reproach a man for lying down in his neigh 

 pericles and aspasia
hour's field because the grass is softer in it
than in his own
aspasia to cleone
not an atom have i been able to collect in
regard to the two poets since they went to the
court hiero but i can give you as correct
and as full information as if i had been seated
between them all the while
hiero was proud his acquisition the
courtiers despised them vexed them whenever
they could and entreated them to command
their services and rely upon their devotion
what more they esteemed each other
but poets are very soon too old for mutual
love
pericles and aspasia 
he who can add one syllable to this shall
have the hand cleon
cleone to aspasia
torturing girl and you aspasia may justly
say ungrateful girl to me you did not give
me what i asked for but you gave me what is
better a glimpse you this is the manner
in which you used to trifle with me making the
heaviest things light the thorniest tractable
and throwing your own beautiful brightness
wherever it was most wanted
but do not slip from me again eschylus
we know is dead we hear that pindar is did
they die abroad 
ah poor xeniades how miserable to be
buried by the stranger 
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
eschylus at the close his seventieth year
died in sicily i know not whether hiero received
him with all the distinction he merited
or rewarded him with the same generosity as
pindar nor indeed have i been able to learn
what would very much gratify me that pindar
who survived him four years and died lately
paid those honours to the greatest man the
most glorious age since earth rose out chaos
which he usually paid with lavish hand to the
prosperous and powerful i hope he did but
the words wealth and gold occur too often in
the poetry pindar
perhaps i may wrong him for a hope is akin
to a doubt it may be that i am mistaken since
we have not all his poems even her'fe in athens
pericles and aspasia 
several these too particularly the dithyrambic
are in danger perishing the odes
on the victors at the games will be preserved
by the vanity the families they celebrate
and being thus safe enough for many years
their own merit will sustain them afterwards
it is owing to a stout nurse that many have
lived to an extreme old age
some the odes themselves are little
value in regard to poetry but he exercises in
all them as much dexterity as the worthies
he applauds had displayed in their exploits
to compensate the disappointment you complained
 i will now transcribe for you anode
 corinna to her native town being quite
sure it is not in your collection let me first
inform you that the exterior the best houses
in tanagra is painted with historical scenes
adventures gods allegories and other things 
and under the walls the city flows the rivulet
 pericles and aspasia
thermidor this it is requisite to tell you
 so small and so distant a place
corunna to tan agra
from athens

tanagra i think not i forget
thy beautifullystoried streets 
be sure my memory bathes yet
in clear thermidor and yet greets
the blythe and liberal shepherdboy
whose sunny bosom swells with joy
when we accept his matted rushes
upheaval with sylvan fruit away he bounds and
blushes

i promise to bring back with me
what thou with transport wilt receive
the only proper gift for thee
 which no mortal shall bereave
pericles and aspasia 
in later times thy mouldering walls
until the last old turret falls 
a crown a crown from athens won
a crown no god can wear beside latona's son
there may be cities who refuse
to their own child the honours due
and look ungently on the muse 
but ever shall those cities rue
the dry unyielding niggard breast
offering no nourishment no rest
to that young head which soon shall rise
disdainfully in might and glory to the skies
sweetly where cavern'd dire flows
do whitearm'd maidens chaunt my lay
flapping the while with laurelrose
the honeygathering tribes away 
e 
 pericles and aspasia
and sweetly sweetly attick tongues
lisp your comma's early songs 
to her with feet more graceful come
the verses that have dwelt in kindred breasts at home
o let thy children lean aslant
against the tender mother's knee
and gaze into her face and want
to know what magic there can be
in words that urge some eyes to dance
while others as in holy trance
look up to heaven be such my praise 
why linger i must haste or lose the delphic bays
cleone to aspasia
epimedea it appears has not corrupted very
grossly your purity and simplicity in dress
pericles and aspasia b
yet remembering your observation on armlets
i cannot but commend your kindness and sufferance
in wearing her emeralds your opinion
was formerly that we should be careful not to
subdivide our persons the arm is composed
 three parts no one them is too long
now the armlet intersects that very portion 
it which must be considered as the most beautiful
in my idea the matter the sandal
alone is susceptible gems after the zone has
received the richest the zone is necessary to
our vesture and encompasses the person in
every quarter the humanized world in one
invariable manner the hair too is divided by
nature in the middle the head there is a
cousinship between the hair and the flowers 
and from this relation the poets have called by
the same name the leaves and it they appear
on the head as if they had been seeking one
another our national dress very different from
 pericles and aspasia
the dresses barbarous nations is not the invention
 the ignorant or the slave but the sculptor
the painter and the poet have studied how best
to adorn the most beautiful object their fancies
and contemplations the indians who believe
that human pains and sufferings are pleasing to
the deity make incisions in their bodies and
insert into them imperishable colours they
also adorn the ears and noses and foreheads 
their gods these were the ancestors the
egyptian we chose handsomer and bettertempered
ones for our worship but retained the
same decorations in our sculpture and to a degree
which the sobriety the egyptian had
merely reduced and chastened hence we retain
the only mark barbarism which dishonors
our national dress the use earrings
if our statues should all be broken by
some convulsion the earth would it be believed
by future ages that in the country and
pericles and aspasia 
age sophocles the women tore holes in their
ears to let rings into as the more brutal 
peasants do with the snouts sows 
aspasia to cleone
cleon i do not know whether i ought to
write out for you any thing minerals
what is amatory poetry without its tenderness 
and what was ever less tender than his take
however the verses such as they are whether
they make you smile or look grave without any
grace their own they must bring one forward
certainly they are his best which cannot be
said every author out whose rarer works i
have added something to your collection
i wish not thasos rich in mines
nor naxos girt around with vines
nor crete nor samos the abodes
 those who govern men and gods
pericles and aspasia
nor wider lydia where the sound
 tymbrels shakes the thymy ground
and with white feet and with hoofs cloven
the deal dance is spun and woven 
meanwhile each prying younger thing
is sent for water to the spring
under where red priapus rears
his club amid the junipers 
in this whole world enough for me
is any spot the gods decree 
albeit the pious and the wise
would tarry where like mulberries
in the first hour ripeness fall
the tender creatures one and all
to take what falls with even mind
jove wills and we must be resign'd
cleone to aspasia
there is less effrontery in those verses 
minerals than in most he has written he
pericles and aspasia 
is among the many poets who never make us
laugh or weep among the many whom we take
into the hand like pretty insects turn them
over look at them for a moment and toss them
into the grass again the earth swarms with
these they live their season and others similar
come into life the next
i have been reading works widely different
from theirs the odes the lovely lesbian
i think she has injured the phaleucian verse
by transposing one foot and throwing it backward
how greatly more noble and more sonorous
are those hendecasyllabicks commencing
the scholium on harmonious and aristogiton
than the very best her's which to my ear
labor and shuffle in their movement her
genius was wonderful was prodigious i am
neither blind to her beauties nor indifferent to
her sufferings we love for ever those whom
we have wept for when we were children we
 pericles and aspasia
love them more than even those who have wept
for us now i have grieved for sappho and
so have you aspasia we shall not therefore
be hard judges her sentiments or her poetry
frequently have we listened to the most absurd
and extravagant praises the answer she
gave alcaeus when he told her he wished to say
something but shame prevented him this
answer her's is a proof that she was deficient
both in delicacy and in tenderness could
sappho be ignorant how infantine inarticulate
is early love could she be ignorant that shame
and fear seize it unrelentingly by the throat
while hardhearted impudence stands at ease
prompt at opportunity and profuse in declarations

there is a gloom in deep love as in deep
water there is a silence in it which suspends
the foot and the folded arms and the dejected
head are the images it reflects no voice shakes
pericles and aspasia 
its surface the muses themselves approach it
with a tardy and a timid step and with a low
and tremulous and melancholy song
the best ode sappho the ode to anac
doria
happy as any god is he c
shows the intemperance and disorder passion
the description her malady may be quite
correct but i confess my pleasure ends at the
first strophe where it begins with the generality
 readers i do not desire to know the effects
 the distemper on her body and i rim out 
the house into the open air although the symptoms
have less in them contagion than 
unseemliness both sophocles and euripides
excite our sympathies more powerfully and
more poetically
i will not interfere any farther with your reflections
 and indeed when i began i intended
to remark only the injustice sappho's reproof
d pericles and aspasia
to alcaeus in the first instance and the justice
 it in the second when he renewed his suit to
her after he had fled from battle we find it
in the only epigram attributed to her
he who from battle runs away
may pray and sing and sing and pray 
nathless alcaeus howsoe'er
dulcet his song and warm his pray'r
and true his vows love may be
he ne'er shall run away with me
in my opinion no lover should be dismissed
with contumely or without the expression 
commiseration unless he has committed some
bad action o aspasia it is hard to love and
not to be loved again i felt it early i still
feel it there is a barb beyond the reach 
dittany but years as they roll by us benumb
in some degree our sense suffering season
comes after season and covers as it were with
pericles and aspasia 
soil and herbage the flints that have cut us so
cruelly in our course
aspasia to cleone
alcaeus often admirable in his poetry was a
vainglorious and altogether worthless man i
must defend sappho she probably knew his
character at the beginning and sported a witticism
not worth much at his expense he
made a pomp and parade his generosity and
courage with which in truth he was but scantily
supplied and all his love lay commodiously at
the point his pen among the rest his first
he was unfit for publick life he was unfit for
private perverse insolent selfish he hated
tyranny because he could not be a tyrant sufficiently
wellborn he was jealous and intolerant
 those who were nothing less so and
 pericles and aspasia
he wished they were all poets that he might expose
a weakness the more in them for rarely
has there been one however virtuous without
some vanity and some invidiousness despiser
 the humble detractor the high iconoclast
 the near and idolater the distant
return we to alcaeus factitious in tenderness
factitious in heroism addicted to falsehood
and unabashed at his fondness for it he attacked
and overcame every rival in that quarter he
picked up all the arrows that were shot against
him rejected all the venom every point and
was almost an archilochus in satire
i do not agree with you in your censure 
sappho there is softness by the side 
power discrimination by the side passion
in this however i do agree with you that her
finest ode is not to be compared to many chorusses
in the tragedians we know that sappho
felt acutely yet sappho is never pathetick
pericles and aspasia 
euripides and sophocles are not remarkable
for the purity the intensity or the fidelity 
their loves yet they touch they transfix the
heart her imagination her whole soul is absorbed
in her own breast she is the prey 
the passions they are the lords and masters
cleone to aspasia
do you remember the lively hegemon whose
curls you pressed down with your forefinger to
see them spring up again do you remember
his biting it for the liberty you had taken and
his kissing it to make it well and his telling
you that he was not quite sure whether some
other kisses here and there might not be requisite
to prevent the spreading the venom 
and do you remember how you turned pale 
and how you laughed with me as we went away
 pericles and aspasia
at his thinking you turned pale because you
were afraid it the boy fifteen as he
was then hath lost all his liveliness all his
assurance all his wit and his radiant beauty
has taken another character his cousin prax
inde whom he was not aware loving until
she was betrothed to calls a merchant 
samos was married a few months ago there
are no verses i read oftener than the loose
dithyrambic poor hegemon do people
love any where else as we love here at miletus 
but perhaps the fondness hegemon may abate
after a time for hegemon is not a woman
how long and how assiduous are we in spinning
that thread the softest and finest in the web 
life which destiny snaps asunder in one moment

yerlcles and aspasia 
hegemon to praxinoe
is there any season o my soul
when the sources bitter tears dry up
and the uprooted flowers take their places again
along the torrentbed 
could i wish to live it would be for that season
to repose my limbs and press my temples there
but should i not speedily start away
in the hope to trace and follow thy steps 
thou art gone thou art gone praxinoe 
and hast taken far from me thy lovely youth
leaving me naught that was desirable in mine
alas alas what hast thou left me 
the helplessness childhood the solitude age
the laughter the happy the pity the scorner
a colourless and broken shadow am i
seen glancing in troubled waters
 pericles and aspasia
my thoughts too are scattered thou hast cast them off
they beat against thee they would cling to thee
but they are viler than the loose dark weeds
without a place to root or rest in
i would throw them across my lyre they drop from it 
my lyre will sound only two measures 
that pity will never never come
or come to the sleep that awakened not unto her
aspasia to cleone
tell hegemon that his verses have made a
deeper impression than his bite and that the
athenians men and women are pleased with
them he has shown that he is a poet by not
attempting to show that he is overmuch one
forbear to inform him that we athenians disapprove
 irregularity in versification we are
little pleased to be rebounded from the 
pericles and aspasia 
a line to the beginning as it often happens and
to be obliged to turn back and make inquiries
in regard to what we have been about there
have latterly been many compositions in which
it is often requisite to read twice over the verses
which have already occupied more than a due
portion our time in reading once the 
is by no means a pleasant or a
graceful exercise but it is quite intolerable
when we invert it to a jumpskipandhop
i take some liberty in these strange novel compounds
but no greater than our friend aristophanes
has taken and not only without reproof
or censure but with great commendation for
it however i have done it for the first and
last time and before the only friend with whom
they can be pardonable henceforward i promise
you cleon i will always be attick or
what is graceful and better still ionian you
shall for ever hear my voice in my letters and
vol i r
 pericles and aspasia
you shall know it to be mine and mine only
already i have had imitators in the style my
conversations but they have imitated others too
and this hath saved me in mercy and pure beneficence
to me the gods have marred the resemblance
nobody can recognise me in my
metempsychosis those who had hoped and
heard better me will never ask themselves
was aspasia so wordy so inelegant affected
and perverse inconsiderate friends have hurt
me worse than enemies could do they have
hinted that the orations pericles have been
retouched by my pen cleon the gods themselves
could not correct his language human
ingenuity with all the malice and impudence
that usually accompany it will never be able to
remodel a single sentence or to substitute a
single word in his speeches to the people
what wealth wisdom has he not thrown away
lest it encumber him in the agora how much
pericles and aspasia 
more than ever was carried into it by the most
popular his opponents some my expressions
may have escaped from him in crowded
places some his cling to me in retirement 
ve cannot love without imitating and we areas
proud in the loss our originality as our
freedom i am sorry that poor hegemon has
not had an opportunity experiencing all this
persuade his friends never to pity him truly or
feignedly for pity keeps the wound open persuade
them rather to flatter him on his poetry
for never was there poet to whom the love 
praise was not the first and most constant 
passions his friends will be the gainers by it 
he will divide among them all the affection
he fancies he has reserved for praxinoe with
most men nothing seems to have happened so
long ago as an affair love let nobody hint
this to him at present it is among the many
truths that ought to be held back it is among
f 
too pericles and aspasia
the many that excite a violent opposition at one
time and obtain at another not much latera
very ductile acquiescence he will receive it
hereafter take my word for him with only
one slight remonstrance you are too hard
upoi ns lovers then follows a shake the
head not abnegation but sanction like
jupiter's
praxinoe it seems is married to a merchant
poor girl i do not like these merchants let
them have wealth in the highest but net beauty
in the highest cunning and calculation can
hardly merit both at last they may aspire if any
civilized country could tolerate it to honours
and distinctions these too let them have but
at tyre and carthage
pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
how many things in poetry as in other matters
are likely to be lost because they are
small cleobuline linton wrote no long
poem her lover was cydnus colophon
there is not a single verse her's in all that
city proof enough that he took no particular
care them at miletus she was quite unknown
not indeed by name but in her works
until the present month when a copy them
was offered to me for sale the first that
caught my eyes was this 
where is the swan breast so white
it made my bubbling life run bright
on that one spot and that alone
on which he rested and stood
gazing now swells the turbid flood 
summer and he for other climes are flown 
 pericles and aspasia
i will not ask you at present to say any thing
in praise cleobuline but do be grateful to
myrtis and corinna 
aspasia to cleone
grateful i am and shall for ever be to
myrtis and corinna but what odour bud or
incense can they wish to be lavished on the
empty sepulchre what praises the thousand
who praise in ignorance or the learned who
praise from tradition when they remember that
they subdued and regulated the proud unruly
pindar and agitated with all their passion the
calm pure breast cleon 
send me the whole volume cleobuline 
transcribe nothing more to compensate you
pericles and aspasia 
as well as i can and indeed i think the compensation
is not altogether an unfair one here
are two little pieces from myrtis autographs
from the library pericles
artemis while arian sighs
raising her white and taper finger
pretends to loose yet makes to linger
the ivy that overshadow her eyes
 wait or you shall not have the kiss
says she but he on wing to pleasure
are there not other hours for leisure 
for love is any hour like this 
artemis faintly thou respondent
as falsely deems that fiery youth 
a god there is who knows the truth
a god who tells me which is fondest
here is another in the same hand a very
clear and elegant one men may be negligent
 pericles and aspasia
in their handwriting for men may be in a
hurry about the business use but i never
knew either a sensible woman or an estimable
one whose writing was disorderly
well the verses are prettier than my reflection
and equally true
i will not love 
these sounds have often
burst from a troubled breast 
rarely from one no sighs could soften
rarely from one at rest
myrtis and corinna like anacreon and
sappho who preceded them were temperate in
the luxuries poetry they had enough todo
with one feeling they were occupied enough
with one reflection they culled but few grapes
from the bunch and never dragged it across the
teeth stripping off ripe and unripe
pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
the verses myrtis which you sent me
last are somewhat less pleasing to me than
those others hers which i send you in return
a few loose ideas on the subject i know
not whether worth writing occur to me at this
moment formerly we were contented with
schools philosophy we now begin to talk
about schools poetry is not that absurd
there is only one school the universe one
only schoolmistress nature those who are
reported to be such or such a school are 
none they have played the truant some are
more careful some more negligent some bring
many dishes some fewer some little seasoned
some highly ground however there is for
f
 pericles and aspasia
the fanciful appellation the young poets at
miletus are beginning to throw off their allegiance
to the established and acknowledged laws
 athens and are weary following in the
train the graver who have been crowned
the various schools as they call them have
assumed distinct titles but the largest and
most flourishing all would be discontented i
am afraid with the properest i could inscribe
it with the queer we really have at present
in our city more good poets than we ever had 
and the queer might be among the best if they
pleased but whenever an obvious and natural
thought presents itself they either reject it
for coming without imagination or they phry
granite it with such biting and hot curlingirons
that it rolls itself up impenetrably they
declare to us that pure and simple imagination
is the absolute perfection poetry and if ever
they admit a sentence or reflection it must be
pericles and aspasia 
one which requires a whole day to unravel and
wind it smoothly on the distaff
to me it appears that poetry ought neither
to be all body nor all soul beautiful features
limbs compact sweetness voice and easiness
 transition belong to the deity who inspires
and represents it we may loiter by the stream
and allay our thirst as it runs but we should
not be forbidden the larger draught from the
deeper well
from mortis
friends whom she lookt at blandly from her couch
and her white wrist above it gembedewed
were arguing with pentheus she had heard
report creon's death whom years before
she listened to wellpleas'd and sighs arose 
for sighs full often fondle with reproofs
and will be fondled by them
when i came
 pericles and aspasia
after the rest to visit her she said
myrtis how kind who better knows than thou
the pangs love and my first love was he 
tell me if ever eros are reveal'd
thy secrets to the earth have they been true
to any love who speak about the first 
what shall these holier lights like twinkling stars
in the few hours assign'd them change their place
and when comes ampler splendour disappear 
idler i am and pardon not reply
implore from thee thus questioned well i know
thou strikes like olympian jove but once
aspasia to cleone
lysicles a young athenian fond travelling
has just returned to us from a voyage in thrace
a love observation in other words curiosity
could have been his only motive for he never
pericles and aspasia 
was addicted to commerce nor disciplined in
philosophy and indeed were he so thrace is
hardly the country he would have chosen i
believe he is the first that ever travelled with
no other intention than to see the cities and
know the manners barbarians he represents
the soil as extremely fertile in its nature
and equally well cultivated and the inhabitants
as warlike hospitable and courteous all this
is credible enough and perhaps as generally
known as might be expected regions so remote
and perilous but ly sides will appear
to you to have assumed a little more than the
fair privileges a traveller in relating that the
people have so imperfect a sense religion as
to bury the dead in the temples the gods
and the priests so avaricious and shameless as
to claim money for the permission this impiety
he told us furthermore that he had
seen a magnificent temple built on somewhat 
 pericles and aspasia
a grecian model in the interior which there
are many flat marbles fastened with iron cramps
against the walls and serving for monuments
continuing his discourse he assured us that
these monuments although none are ancient
are all forms and dimensions as if the thracian
were resolved to waste and abolish the
symmetry they had adopted and that they are
inscribed in an obsolete language so that the
people whom they might animate and instruct
by recording brave and virtuous actions pass
them carelessly by breaking ofi now and then
a nose from a conqueror and a wing from an
agathodemon
thrace is governed by many princes one
 them teres odyssey has gained great adheres
not only governed the larger part 
thrace but influenced many the free and independent
states in that country and led into the field
the gets the agrarian the lessons and the pceo
pericles and aspasia ill
vantages in war no doubt this is uninteresting
to you but it is necessary to the course 
my narration will you believe it yet lysicles
is both intelligent and trustworthy will you
believe that at the return the thracian
prince to enjoy the fruits his victory he
ordered an architect to build an arch for himself
and his army to pass under on their road
into the city as if a road on such an occasion
ought not rather to be widened than narrowed 
if you will not credit this a barbarian who
is reported to be an intelligent and prudent
man in other things you will exclaim i fear
against the exaggeration lysicles and my
nians thucydides says that to coast his kingdom
required four days and four nights for the swiftest
vessel sailing before the wind and that by land an
expeditious walker would hardly cross it in thirteen
days stances the son teres ravaged all macedonia
in the reign perdiccas
 pericles and aspasia
credulity when i relate to you on his authority
that to the same conqueror by his command
there has been erected a column sixty cubits
high supporting his effigy in marble 
imagine the general an army standing
upon a column sixty cubits to show himself 
a crane might do it after a victory over a
pygmy or it might aptly represent the virtues
 a ropedancer exhibiting how little he was
subject to dizziness
i will write no more about it for really i am
beginning to think that some pretty thracian
has given poor lysicles a lovepotion and that
it has affected his brain a little
cleone to aspasia
never will i believe that a people however
otherwise ignorant and barbarous yet capable
pericles and aspasia 
 turning a regular arch and erecting a lofty
column can be so stupid and absurd as you
have represented what bury dead bodies in
the temples cast them out their own houses
into the houses the gods depend upon it
aspasia they were the bones victims and
the strange uncouth inscriptions commemorate
votive offerings in the language the priests
whatever it may be so far is clear regarding
the arch lysicles saw them removing it
and fancied they were building it this mistake
is really ludicrous the column you must
have perceived at once was erected not to display
the victor but to expose the vanquished
a blunder very easy for an idle traveller to
commit few the thracian i conceive
even in the interior are so utterly ignorant 
grecian arts as to raise a statue at such a
height above the ground that the vision shall
 pericles and aspasia
not comprehend all the features easily and the
spectator see and contemplate the object his
admiration as nearly and in the same position
as he was used to do in the agora
the monument the greatest man should
be only a bust and a name if the name alone
is insufficient to illustrate the bust let them
both perish
enough about thracian enough about
tombs and monuments two pretty milesian
agapenthe and peristera who are in love with
you for loving me are quite resolved to kiss
your hand you must not detain them long
with you miletus is not to send all her beauty
to be kept at athens we have no such
treaty
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
there is such a concourse philosophers
all anxious to show alcibiades the road to
virtue that am afraid they will completely
block it up before him among the rest is my
old friend socrates who seems resolved to
transfer to him all the philosophy he designed
for me with very little that which i presented
to him in return
and would you believe it alcibiades who
began with ridiculing him now attends to him
with as much fondness as hyacinthus did to
apollo the graver and uglier philosophers
however they differ on other points agree in
these that beauty does not reside in the body
but in the mind that philosophers are the
only true heroes and that heroes alone are
 pericles and aspasia
entitled to the privilege being implicitly
obeyed by the beautiful
doubtless there may be very fine pearls in
very uninviting shells but our philosophers
never wade kneedeep into the beds attracted
rather to what is bright externally
cleone to aspasia
alcibiades ought not to have captious or
inquisitive men about him i know not what
the sophists are good for i only know they
are the very worst instructors iogick however
perverted is not for boys argumentation
is among the most dangerous early
practices and sends away both fancy and modesty
the young mind should be nourished
pericles and aspasia 
with simple and grateful food and not too copious
it should be little exercised until its
nerves and muscles show themselves and even
then rather for air than any thing else study
is the bane boyhood the aliment youth
the indulgence manhood and the restorative
 age
i am confident that persons like you and
pericles see little these sharpers who pla
tricks upon words it is amusing to observe
how they do it once or twice as there are
some flowers which you should smell but slightly
to extract all that is pleasant in them and
which if you do otherwise emit what is unpleasant
or noxious so there are some men
with whom a slight acquaintance is quite sufficient
to draw out all that is agreeable a more
intimate one would be unsatisfactory and unsafe

 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
pericles rarely says he likes any thing but
whenever he is pleased he expresses it by his
countenance although when he is displeased he
never shows it even by the faintest sign it
was long before i ventured to make the observation
to him he replied
it would be ungrateful and ungentle not to
return my thanks for any pleasure imparted tome
when a smile has the power conveying
them i never say that a thing pleases me
while it is yet undone or absent lest i should
give somebody the trouble performing or
producing it as for what is displeasing i
really am very insensible in general to matters
 this nature and when i am not so i experience
more satisfaction in subduing my feeling
than i ever felt displeasure at the ocpericles
and a spa si a 
currency which excited it politeness is in
itself a power and takes away the weight and
galling from every other we may exercise i
foresee he added that alcibiades will be an
elegant man but i apprehend he will never bea
polite one there is a difference and a
greater than we are apt to perceive or imagine
alcibiades would win without conciliating he
would seize and hold but would not acquire
the man who is determined to keep others fast
and firm must have one the bond about
his own breast sleeping and waking
aspasia to cleone
agapenthe and peristera the bearers your
letter came hither in safety and health late
as the season is for navigation they complain
 pericles and aspasia
 our cold climate in athens and shudder at
the sight snow upon the mountains in the
horizon
hardly had they been seen with me before
the housewives and sages were indignant at
their effrontery in fact they gazed in wonder
at the ugliness our sex in attica and at the
gravity philosophers whom stories so ludicrous
are related i do not think i shall be
able to find them lovers here peristera hath
lost a little her dovelike faculty if ever she
had much at the report which has been raised
about her cousin and herself dracontides was
very fond agapenthe she however was by
no means so fond him which is always the
case when young men would warm us at their
fire before ours is kindled for honestly to
confess the truth the very best us are more
capricious than sensitive and more sensitive
than grateful dracontides is not indeed a man
pericles and aspasia 
to excite so delightful a feeling he is confident
that peristera must be the cause agagentle's
disinclination to him for how is it
possible that a young girl perverted mind
could be indifferent to dracontides unable
to discover that any sorceress was employed
against him he turned his anger toward perish
and declared in her presence that her malignity
alone could influence so abusively the
generous mind agapenthe at my request
the playful girl consented to receive him
seated upon an amphora in the aviary she was
stroking the neck a noble peacock while the
bird pecked at the berries on a branch 
arbutus in her bosom dracontides entered
conducted by peristera who desired her cousin
to declare at once whether it was by any malignity
 her's that he had hitherto failed to
conciliate her regard
o the illtempered frightful man cried
vol i g
 pericles and aspasia
agapenthe does any body that is not malicious
ever talk malignity 
dracontides went away calling upon the gods
for justice
the next morning a rumour ran throughout
athens how he had broken off his intended
nuptials on the discovery that aspasia had
destined the two loans to the pleasures 
pericles moreover he had discovered that one
 them he would not say which had certainly
threads several colours in her threadbare not
to mention a lock hair whether a deadman
or no might by some be doubted and
that the other was about to be consigned to
pyrilampes in exchange for a peacock and
sundry smaller birds
no question could be entertained the fact
for the girls were actually in the house and the
birds in the aviary
agapenthe declares she waits only for the
pericles and aspasia 
spring and will then leave athens for her dear
miletus where she never heard such an expression
as malignity
o what rude people the athenians are 
said she
aspasia to cleone
rather than open my letter again i write
another
agapenthe's heart is won by mnasylus i
never suspected it
on his return out thessaly whither i
fancy he went on purpose he brought a cage 
nightingales there are few them in attica 
and none being kept tame none remain with us
through the winter the four brought by
mnasylus one sings even in this season the
year agapenthe and peristera were awakened
g
 pericles and aspasia
in the morning by the thrilling song a birdlike
a nightingale in the aviary they went
down together and over the door they found
these verses
maiden or youth who stances here
think not if haply we should fear
a stranger's voice or stranger's face
such is the nature our race
that we would gladly fly again
to gloomy wood or windy plain
certain we are we ne'er should find
a care so provident so kind
altho by flight we repossess
the tenderest mother's warmest nest
o may you prove as well as we
that even in athens there may be
a sweeter thing than liberty
this is surely the handwriting mnasy
lus said agapenthe
how do you know his handwriting cried
peristera
pericles and aspasia 
a blush and a kiss and one gentle push were
the answer
mnasylus on hearing the sound footsteps
had retreated behind a thicket augustine
and hyacinthus in which the aviary is situated
fearful bringing the gardener into reproof for
admitting him however his passion was uncontrollable
 and peristera declares although
agapenthe denies it that he caught a kiss upon
each his cheeks by the interruption certain
it is for they agree in it that he threw his
arms around them both as they were embracing
and implored them to conceal the fault poor
old alton who shewed me said he more
pity than agapenthe will ever shew me
why did you bring these birds hither
said she trying to frown
because you asked replied he the other
day whether we had any in attica and told me
you had many at home
 pericles and aspasia
she turned away abruptly and running upto
my chamber would have informed me why
superfluous confidence her tears wetted
my cheek
agapenthe said i smiling are you sure
you have cried for the last time o what rude
people the athenians are 
aspasia to pericles
i apprehend o pericles not only that i
may become an object jealousy and hatred
to the athenians by the notice you have taken
 me but that you yourself which affects me
greatly more may cease to retain the whole
 their respect and veneration
whether to acquire a great authority over
the people some things are not necessary to
pericles and aspasia 
be done on which virtue and wisdom are at
variance it becomes not me to argue or consider
but let me suggest the inquiry to you
whether he who is desirous supremacy should
devote the larger portion his time to one
person
three affections the soul predominate
love religion and power the first two are often
united the other stands widely apart from them
and neither is admitted nor seeks admittance to
their society i wonder then how you can
love so truly and tenderly ought i not rather
to say i did wonder was pisistratus affectionate
 do not be angry it is certainly the
first time a friend has ever ventured to discover
a resemblance although you are habituated
to it from your opponents in these
you forgive it do you in me 
 pericles and aspasia
pericles to aspasia
pisistratus was affectionate the rest his
character you know as well as i do you know
that he was eloquent that he was humane
that he was contemplative that he was learned 
that he not only was profuse to men genius
but cordial and that it was only with such men
he was familiar and intimate you know that
he was the greatest the wisest the most virtuous
excepting solon and lycurgus that ever
ruled any portion the human race is it not
happy and glorious for mortals when instead
 being led by the ears under the clumsy and
violent hand vulgar and clamorous adventurers
a pisistratus leaves the volumes 
homer and the conversation solon for
them
we may be introduced to power by humanity
and at first may love her less for her own
pericles and aspasia 
sake than for humanity's but by degrees we
become so accustomed to her as to be quite
uneasy without her
religion and power like the cariatides in
sculpture never face one another they sometimes
look the same way but oftener stand back
to back
we will argue about them one at a time and
about the other in the triad too let me have
the choice
aspasia to pericles
we must talk over again the subject your
letter no not talk but write about it
i think pericles you who are so sincere with
me are never quite sincere with others you
have contracted this bad habitude from your
custom addressing the people but among
g 
 pericles and aspasia
friends and philosophers would it not be better
to speak exactly as we think whether ingeniously
or not ingenious things i am afraid
are never perfectly true however i would not
exclude them the difference being very wide
between perfect truth and violated truth i
would not even leave them in a minority i
would hear and say as many as may be letting
them pass current for what they are worth
anaxagoras rightly remarked that love always
makes us better religion sometimes power
never
aspasia to cleone
pericles was delighted with your letter on
education i wish he were as pious as you
are occasionally he appears so i attacked
him on his simulation but it produced a sudden
and powerful effect on alcibiades you will
pericles and aspasia 
collect the whole from a summary our conversation

so very true said he is the remark 
anaxagoras that it was worth my while to controvert
it did you not observe the attention
paid to it by young and old i was unwilling
that the graver part the company should
argue tomorrow with alcibiades on the nature
 love as they are apt to do and should persuade
him that he would be the better for it
on this consideration i said while you were
occupied o anaxagoras if we this household
knew not how religious a man you are your
discourse would in some degree lead us to countenance
the suspicions your enemies religion
is never too little for us it satisfies all the
desires the soul love is but an atom it
consuming and consumed by the stubble on
which it falls but when it rests upon the
gods it partakes their nature in its essence
 pericles and aspasia
pure and eternal love indeed works great
miracles as in the ocean that embraces the
earth whatever is sordid is borne away and
disappears in it so the flame love purifies
the temple it burns in 
only when first lighted said anaxagoras
generally the heat is either spent or stifling
soon afterwards and the torch when it is extinguished
leaves an odour very different from
myrrh and frankincense
he had turned the stream pericles then
proceeded
something power said he hath been
consigned to me by the favour and indulgence
 the athenians i do not dissemble that i
was anxious to obtain it i do not dissemble
that my vows and supplications for the prosperity
 the country were unremitted it
pleased the gods to turn toward me the eyes
 my fellow citizens but had they not blessed
pericles and aspasia 
me with religion they never would have blessed
me with power better and more truly called an
influence on their hearts and their reason a
high and secure place in the acropolis their
affections yes anaximander yes melon 
i do say had they not blessed me with it for
in order to obtain it i was obliged to place a
daily and a nightly watch over all my thoughts
and actions in proportion as authority was
consigned to me i found it both expedient and
easy to grow better time not being left me for
sedentary occupations or frivolous pursuits and
every desire being drawn on and absorbed in
that mighty and interminable that rushing renovating
and purifying one which comprehends
our country if any young man would win to
himself the hearts the wise and brave and
is ambitious being the guide and leader 
them let him be assured that his virtue will
give him power and power will consolidate and
 pericles and a aspasia
maintain his virtue let him never then
squander away the inestimable hours youth
in tangled and trifling disquisitions with such
as perhaps have an interest in perverting or unsettling
his opinions and who speculate into
his sleeping thoughts and dandle his nascent
passions but let him start from them with
alacrity and walk forth with firmness let him
early take an interest in the business and concerns
 men and let him as he goes along
look stedfastly at the statues those who have
benefited his country and make with himself
a solemn compact to stand hereafter among
them
i had heard the greater part this already
all but the commencement at the conclusion
alcibiades left the room i feared he was conscious
that something in it was toa closely applicable
to him how i rejoiced when i saw
him enter again with a helmet like minerva's
pericles and aspasia 
on his head a spear in his hand crying to
sparta boys to sparta 
pericles whispered to me but in a voice
audible to those who sate farther off alcibiades
i trust is destined to abolish the influence
and subvert the power that restless
and troublesome rival
aspasia to pericles
i disbelieve o pericles that it is good for
us that it is good for men women or nations
to be without a rival
acquit me now any desire that in your
generosity you should resolve on presenting
me with such a treasure for i am without the
ability returning it but have you never
observed how many graces person and demeanour
we women are anxious to display in
 pericles and aspasia
order to humble a rival which we were unconscious
 possessing until opposite charms provoked
them 
sparta can only be humbled by the prosperity
and liberality athens she was ever
jealous and selfish athens has been too often
so it is only by forbearance toward dependent
states and by kindness toward the
weaker that her power can long preponderate
strong attachments are strong allies this
truth is so clear as to be colourless and i
should fear that you would censure me for
writing what almost a child might have spoken
were i ignorant that the important truth has
made little impression on the breasts statesmen
i admire your wisdom in resolving to
increase no farther the domains attica and
in designing to surround her with the outworks
 islands and to encompass her more closely
with small independent communities it is
pericles and aspasia 
only from such as these that virtue can come
forward neither hurt nor heated the crowd is
too dense for her in larger but what is mostly
our consideration it is only such as these that
are sensible benefits they cling to you
afflicted in your danger the greater look on
with folded arms nod knowingly cry sad work 
when you are worsted and turn their backs
on you when you are fallen
pericles to aspasia
there are things aspasia beyond the art
 phidias he may represent love leaning
upon his bow and listening to philosophy but
not for hours together he may represent
love while he is giving her a kiss for her
lesson tying her arms behind her loosing
them again must be upon another marble
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
the philosophers are less talkative in our
conversations now alcibiades has given up his
mind to mathematicks and strategy and seldom
comes among them
pericles told me they will not pour out the
rosewater for their beards unless into a corinthian
or golden vase
but take care added he to offend no
philosopher any sect whatever indeed to
offend any person is the next foolish thing to
being offended i never do it unless when it
is requisite to discredit somebody who might
otherwise have the influence to diminish my
estimation politeness is not always a sign 
wisdom but the want it always leaves room
for a suspicion folly if folly and imprudence
are the same i have scarcely had time to
pericles and aspasia 
think any blessings that entered my house
with you beyond those which encompass myself
yet it cannot but be obvious that alcibiades
hath now an opportunity improving
his manners such as even the society scholastick
men will never countervail this is a
high advantage on all occasions particularly in
embassies wellbred men require it and let
it pass the illbred catch at it greedily as
fishes are attracted from the mud and netted
by the shine flowers and shells
aspasia to cleone
at last i have heard him speak in public
apollo may shake the rocks delphi and
may turn the pious pale my pericles rises with
serenity his voice hath at once left his lips
 pericles and aspasia
and entered the heart athens the violent
and desperate tremble in every hostile city a
thunderbolt seems to have split in the center
and to have scattered its sacred fire unto the
whole circumference greece
the greatest prodigies are the prodigies
 a mortal they are indeed the only ones 
with the gods there are none
alas alas the eloquence and the wisdom
the courage and the constancy my pericles
must have their and the glorious shrine
wherein they stand preeminent must one day
drop into the deformity death 
o aspasia the tears thou art shedding
tears pride tears fondness are there none
in those many for thyself yes whatever
was attributed to thee grace or beauty so
valuable for his sake whose partiality assigned
them to thee must go first and all that he
loses is a loss to thee weep then on
pericles and aspasia 
pericles to aspasia
do you love me do you love me stay
reason upon it sweet aspasia doubt hesitate
question drop it take it up again provide
raise obstacles reply indirectly oracles are
sacred and there is a pride in being a diviner
aspasia to pericles
will do none those things you tell me todo
 but i will say something you forgot to say
about the insufficiency phidias
he may represent a hero with unbent brows
a sage with the lyre poetry in his hand
ambition with her face halfaverted from the
city but he cannot represent in the same
sculpture at the same distance aphrodite
 pericles and asjasia
higher than pallas he would be derided if he
did and a great man can never do that for
which a little man may deride him
i shall love you even more than i do if you
will love yourself more than me did ever
lover talk so pray tell me for i have forgotten
all they ever talked about but pericles
 pericles be careful to lose nothing 
your glory or you lose all that can be lost 
me my pride my happiness my content 
every thing but my poor weak love keep glory
then for my sake 
aspasia to cleone
i am not quite certain that you are correct
in your decision on the propriety sculpturing
the statues our deities from one sole material
those however mortals and nymphs
pericles and aspasia 
and genii should be marble and marble only
but you will pardon a doubt a long doubt a
doubt for the chin to rest upon in the palm 
the hand when cleon thinks one thing and
phidias another i debated with pericles on
the subject
in my opinion said he no material for
statuary is so beautiful as marble and far from
allowing that two or more materials should compose
one statue i would not willingly see an interruption
made in the figure a god or
goddess even by the folds drapery i would
venture to take the cestus from venus distinguishing
her merely by her own peculiar beauty
but in the representations the more awful
powers who are to be venerated and worshipped
as the patrons and protectors cities we must
take into account the notions the people
in their estimate gold and ivory give splendour
and dignity to the gods themselves and our
 pericles and aspasia
wealth displays their power beside but
bring your ear closer when they will not indulge
us with their favour we may borrow their
cloaks and ornaments and restore them when
they have recovered their temper
aspasia to cleone
after i had written to you we renewed our
conversation on the same subject i inquired
 pericles whether he thought the appellation
 golden was applied to venus for her precious
gifts or for some other reason his answer
was
small statues venus are more numerous
than any other deity and the first that were
gilt in greece i believe were hers she is
worshipped you know not only as the goddess
pericles and aspasia 
 beauty but likewise as the goddess fortune
in the former capacity we are her rapturous
adorers for five years perhaps in the
latter we persevere for life many carry her
image with them on their journeys and there is
scarcely a house in any part greece wherein
it is not a principal ornament
i remarked to him that apollo from the
colour his hair and the radiance his countenance
would be more appropriately represented
in gold and yet that the poets were unmindful
to call him the golden
they never found him so said he but
venus often smiles upon them in one department
little images her are often solid
gold and are placed on the breast or under
the pillow other deities are seldom such
diminutive size or such precious materials it
is only late that they have even borne the
semblance them the egyptians the in
voi h
 pericles and aspasia
vendors all durable colours and indeed 
every thing else that is durable in the arts devised
the means investing other metals with
dissolved gold the phoenicians barbarous and
indifferent to elegance and refinement could
only cover them with tabular incrustations
by improving the inventions egypt bronze
odious in its own proper colour for the human
figure and more odious for divinities assumes
a splendour and majesty which almost compensate
for marble itself
metal said i has the advantage in durability

surely not answered he and it is more
exposed to invasion and avarice but either 
them under cover may endure many thousand
years i apprehend and without corrosion the
temples egypt which have remained two
thousand are fresh at this hour as when they
were first erected and all the violence campericles
and aspasia 
bases and his army bent on effacing the images
have done little more harm if you look at them
from a short distance than a single fly would do
in a summer day on a statue pentelican
marble the egyptians have labored more to
commemorate the weaknesses man than the
grecians to attest his energies this however
must be conceded to the egyptians that they
are the only people on earth to whom destruction
has not been the first love and principal
occupation the works their hands will
outlive the works their intellect here at
least i glory in the sure hope that we shall
differ from them judgment and perception 
the true and beautiful will never allow our statuaries
to represent the human countenance as
they have done in granite and porphyry and
basalt their statues have resisted time and
war ours will vanquish envy and malice
sculpture has made great advances in my
h
 pericles and aspasia
time painting still greater for until the last
forty years it was inelegant and rude sculpture
can go no farther painting can she may
add scenery and climate to her forms she
may give to philoctetes not only the wing 
the seabird wherewith he cools the throbbing
 his wound not only the bow and the quiver
at his feet but likewise the gloomy rocks the
vulcanian vaults and the distant fires 
lemnos the fierce inhabitants subdued by pity
the remorseless betrayer and the various emotions
 his retiring friends her reign is
boundless but the fairer and the richer part 
her dominions lies within the odyssea painting
by degrees will perceive her advantages
over sculpture but if there are paces between
sculpture and painting there are parasangs
between painting and poetry the difference
is that a lake confined by mountains and a
river running on through all the varieties 
pericles and aspasia 
scenery perpetual and unimpeded sculpture
and painting are moments life poetry is life
itself and every thing around it and above it
but let us turn back again to the position
we set out from and offer due reverence to the
truest diviners the gods phidias in ten
days is capable producing what would outlive
ten thousand years if man were not resolved to
be the subverter mans glory the gods
themselves will vanish away before their
images
o cleon this is painful to hear i wish
pericles and i too were somewhat more religious
 it is so sweet and graceful
cleone to aspasia
she o aspasia who wishes to be more re
hgious hath much religion although the 
pericles and aspasia
utility her imagination and the velocity her
pursuits do not permit her to settle fixedly on
the object it how could i have ever loved
you so if i believed the gods would disapprove
 my attachment as they certainly would if
you underrated their power and goodness 
they take especial care both to punish the unbeliever
and to strike with awe the witnesses 
unbelief i accompanied my father not long
since to the temple apollo and when we
had performed the usual rites our devotion
there came up to us a young man somewhat
pleasing aspect with whose family ours was
anciently on terms intimacy after my father
had made the customary inquiries he conversed
with us about his travels he had just left
ephesus and said he had spent the morning in a
comparison between diana's temple and apollo's
he told us that they are similar in design but
that the ephesian goddess is an ugly lump 
pericles and aspasia 
darkcoloured stone while our apollo is 
such transcendent beauty that on first beholding
him he wondered any other god had a
worshipper my father was transported with
joy at such a declaration
give up the others said he worship
here and rely on prosperity
were i myself to select answered he
any deity in preference to the rest it should
not be an irascible or vindictive or unjust
one
surely not cried my father it should
be apollo and our apollo what has diana
done for any man or any woman i speak
submissively with all reverence i do not
question
the young man answered i will forbear to
say a word about diana having been educated
in great fear her but surely the treatment
 pericles and aspasia
 marsyas by apollo was bordering on severity

not a whit cried my father if understood
rightly
his assent to the request phaeton continued
the young man knowing as he did
the consequence seems a little deficient in that
foresight which belongs peculiarly to the god 
prophecy
my father left me abruptly ran to the font
and sprinkled first himself then me lastly the
guest with lustral water
we mortals continued he gravely should
not presume to argue on the gods after our own
inferior nature and limited capacities what
appears to have been cruel might have been
most kindly provident
the reasoning is conclusive said the youth 
you have caught by the hand a benighted and
pericles and aspasia 
wandering dreamer and led him from the brink
 a precipice i see nothing left now on the
roadside but the skin marsyas and it would
be folly to start or flinch at it
my father had a slight suspicion his sincerity
and did not invite him to the house he
has attempted to come more than once evidently
with an earnest desire to explore the
truth several days together he has been seen
on the very spot where he made the confession
to my father in deep thought and as we hope
under the influence the deity
i forgot to tell you that this young person is
phrases son portio the can
aspasia to cleone
if ever there was a youth whose devotion was
ardent and whose face i venture to say 

 pericles and aspasia
though i never saw it was prefigured for the
offices adoration i suspect it must be phrases
son portio the can
happy the man who when every thought
else is dismissed comes last and alone into the
warm and secret foldings a letter 
aspasia to cleone
alcibiades entered the library one day
when i was writing out some verses he discovered
what i was about by my hurry in attempting
to conceal them
alcibiades said we do not like to
be detected in any thing so wicked as poetry
some day or other i shall perhaps have my
revenge and catch you committing the same
sin with more pertinacity
pericles and aspasia 
do you fancy said he that i cannot
write a verse or two if i set my heart upon it 
no replied i but i doubt whether your
heart in its lightness and volubility would not
roll off so slippery a plinth we remember
your poetical talents displayed in all their
brightness on poor socrates
do not laugh at socrates said he the
man is by no means such a quibbler and impostor
as some his disciples would represent him
making him drag along no easy muleload by
hercules no summer robe no everyday vesture
no nurse an afterdinner nap but a
trailing troublesome intricate piece sophistry
interwoven with flowers and sphinxes stolen
from an egyptian temple with dust enough
in it to blind all the crocodiles as far as to the
cataracts and to dry up the nile at its highest
overflow he is rather fond strangling an
unwary interloper with a string questions 
 pericles and aspasia
which it is difficult to see the length or the
knots until the two ends are about the throat
but he lets him off easily when he has fairly set
his mark on him anaxagoras tells me that
there is not a school in athens where the
scholars are so jealous and malicious while he
himself is totally exempt from those worst and
most unphilosophical passions that the parasitical
weed grew up together with their very
root and soon overtop the plant but that it
only hangs to his railings now anaxagoras
envies nobody and only perplexes us by the
admiration his generosity modesty and
wisdom
i did not come hither to disturb you aspasia
 and will retire when i have given you
satisfaction or revenge this i think is the
word not only have i written verses and as
you may well suppose long after those upon
the son sophroniscus but verses upon love
pericles and aspasia 
are we none us in the secret said i
you shall be said he attend and pity
i must have turned pale i think for i shuddered
he repeated these and relieved me
i love to look on lovely eyes
and do not shun the sound sighs
if they are level with the ear 
but if they rise just o'er my chin
o venus how i hate their din 
my own i am too weak to bear
aspasia to cleone
we are but pebbles in a gravel walk
some blacker and some whiter pebbles still
fit only to be trodden on
these words were introduced into a comedy
lately written by polus a remarkably fat person
 pericles and aspasia
and who appears to have enjoyed use and liberty
as much as any citizen in athens i happen to
have rendered some services to chlorides the
actor to whom the speech is addrest he
brought me the piece before its representation
telling me that polus and his friends had resolved
to applaud the passage and to turn their
faces toward pericles i made him a little present
on condition that in the representation
he should repeat the following verses in reply
instead the poet's
fair polus 
can such fierce winds blow over such smooth seas 
i never saw a pebble in my life
so richly set as thou art now by jove
he who would tread upon thee can be none
except the proudest the elephants
the tallest and the surestfooted beast
in all the stables the kings lud
the comedy was interrupted by roars 
pericles and aspasia 
laughter the friends polus slunk away and
he himself made many a violent effort to do
the same but amphicydes who stood next
threw his arms round his neck crying
behold another crus i devoting himself
for his country the infernal powers require
no black bull for sacrifice they are quite satisfied
eternal peace with boeotia eternal
praise to her what a present where was he
fatted 
we had invited polus to dine with us and
now condoled with him on his loss appetite
the people athens were quite out favour
with him
i told them what they were fit for cried
he and they proved it amphicydes 
i do not say he has been at sparta i
myself saw him no long time ago on the
road that leads to megara that city rebelled
soon after his wife died strangely she had
 pericles and aspasia
not been married two years and had grown
ugly and thin he might have used her fora
broom if she had hair enough perhaps
he did odd noises have been heard in the
house i have no suspicion or spite against
any man living and praise to the gods i
can live without being an informer
we listened with deep interest but could
not understand the allusion as he perceived by
our looks
you will hear tomorrow said he how
unworthily i have been treated wit draws
down folly upon us and she must have her
fling it does not hit it does not hit
slaves brought in a ewer water with several
napkins they were not lost upon polus
and he declared that those two boys had more
sagacity and intuition than all the people in
the theatre
in your house and your administration o
pericles and aspasia 
pericles every thing is timed well and done
well without our knowing how dust will
rise said he dust will rise if we would not
raise it we must never stir they have begun
with those who would reform their manners
they will presently carry their violence against
those who maintain and execute the laws
supper was served
a quail o best polus 
o best polus o wonderful o lady c
the editor has thought it his duty to be quite
literal in translating n jsextiore n eavfiaarie h seairoiva
c conversation was never carried on without them
even among philosophers as we see in plato c an
apology ought to be offered for not adorning the text
with the greek it being the fashion to enrich the
toilet with antiquities poverty must plead for the
editor when he publishes the letters cleopatra he
promises his fair friends that he will be more liberal
 the coptic the original greek being lost and
the coptic being the only known version
 pericles and aspasia
a quail o wonderful may hurt me but
being recommended 
it disappeared
the breast that capon 
capons being melancholic breed melan
holy within
coriander seed might correct it together
with a few those white plump pineseeds
 the very deliberation 
it was corrected
tunny under oil with marjoram and figs
pickled locusts and mustachios for your stomach
seems delicate
alas indeed it is declining tunny 
tunny i dare not o festoon the graces 
i dare not verily chian wine alone can appease
its seditious
they were appeased
some livers were offered him whether offish
or fowl i know not for i can hardly bear
pericles and aspasia 
to look at that dish he waved them away
but turned suddenly round and said youth 
i think i smell fennel
there is fennel o mighty one replied
the slave and not fennel only but parsley
and honey pepper and rosemary garlick from
salamis and 
say no more say no more fennel is enough
for moderate men and brave ones it reminds
me the field marathon
the field was won nothing was left upon it
another slave came forward announcing
loudly and pompously gosling from brauron 
sauce prunes mustardseed capers fenugreek
sesamum and squills
squills exclaimed polus they soothe
the chest it is not every cook that is deep in
the secrets nature brauron an ancient
city i have friends in brauron i will taste
were it only for remembrance them
 pericles and aspasia
he made several essays several pauses
but when shall we come to the squills 
said he turning to the slave the qualities 
the others are negative
the whole dish was presently
our pastry said i o illustrious polus 
is the only thing i can venture to recommend
at table the other dishes are merely on sufferance
but really our pastry is good i
usually dine entirely upon it
entirely cried he in amaze
with a glass water added i and some
grapes fresh or dry
to accompany you o divine aspasia 
though in good truth this said pastry is but a sandy
sort road no great way can be made in it
the diffident polus was not a bad engineer
however and he soon had an opportunity 
admiring the workmanship at the bottom the
salver
pericles and aspasia 
two dishes roast meat were carried to
him i know not what one was nor could
polus easily make up his mind upon it experiment
following experiment kid however was
an old acquaintance
those who kill kids said he deserve
well their country for they grow up mischievous
 the gods aware this make them
very eatable they require some management
some skill some reflection mint shalt dandelion
vinegar strong coercion upon em
chian wine boy 
what does pericles eat
do not mind pericles he has eaten 
the quails and some roast fish besprinkled with
dried bayleaves for sauce
fish ay that makes him so vigilant
cats 
here he stopt not however without a diversion
in his favour from me observing that
 pericles and aspasia
he usually dined on vegetables fish and some
bird that his earlier meal was his longest
confectionary honey and white bread composing
it
chian or lesbian
 he enjoys a little wine after dinner preferring
the lighter and subacid
wonderful man cried he and all from
such fare as that 
when he rose from table he seemed by his
countenance to be quiet again at heart nevertheless
he said in my ear with a sigh did
i possess the power pericles or the persuasion
 aspasia by the immortals i would
enrich the gallies with a grand dotation every
soul them would i yes every soul them 
monsters ingratitude hypocrites traitors
they should for egypt for carthage mauritania
numidia he will find out before long what
dogs he has been skimming the kettle for
pericles and aspasia 
it required an effort to be perfectly composed
at a simili which i imagine has never
been used in the greek language since the days
 medea but i cast down my eyes and said
consolatory it is difficult to do justice to
such men as pericles and polus
he would now have let me into the secret
but others saved me
aspasia to cleone
anaxagoras is the true firm constant friend
 pericles the golden lamp that shines perpetually
on the image i adore yet sometimes
he speaks severely on one these occasions
pericles took him by the hand saying
o anaxagoras sincere and ardent lover
 pericles and aspasia
 truth why do not you love her in such
a manner as never to let her see you out 
humour 
because said anaxagoras you divide
my affections with her much to my shame
pericles was called away on business i then
said
o anaxagoras is not pericles a truly great
man 
he answered if pericles were a truly great
man he would not wish to appear different from
what he is he would know himself and make
others know him he seems to guard against
both much is wanting to constitute his greatness
he possesses it is true more comprehensiveness
and concentration than any living 
perhaps more than any since solon but he
thinks that power over others is better than
power over himself as if a mob were worth a
man and an acclamation were worth a pericles
pericles and aspasia 
but said i he has absolute command
over himself and it is chiefly by exerting it
that he has obtained an ascendency over the
minds others
has he rendered them wiser and more virtuous
 said he
you know best replied i having lived
much longer among them
perhaps said anaxagoras i may wrong
him perhaps he has saved them from worse
disasters
you think him then ambitious said i
with some sadness
ambitious cried he how so he might
have been a philosopher and he is content to
be a ruler
i was ill at ease
come said i anaxagoras come into
the garden with me it is rather too warm indeed
out doors but we have many evervol
i i
 pericles and aspasia
greens high and shady and those who like
you and me never drink wine have little to
dread from the heat
whether the ilexes and bays and oleanders
struck his imagination and presented the
simili i cannot tell but he thus continued in
illustration his discourse
there are no deciduous plants aspasia 
the greater part lose their leaves in winter the
rest in summer it is thus with men the
generality yield and are stript under the first
chilly blasts that shake them they who have
weathered these drop leaf after leaf in the sunshine
the virtues by which they arose to
popularity take another garb another aspect
another form and totally disappear be not
uneasy the heart pericles will never dry up
so many streams run into it
he retired to his studies i spoke but little
that evening and slept late
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
how can i ever hope to shew you in all its
brightness the character my friend i will
tell you how by following love and truth
like most others who have no genius i do not
feel the want it at least not here
a shallow water may reflect the sun as perfectly
as a deeper
the words anaxagoras stuck to me like
thistles i resolved to speak in playfulness with
the object our conversation first i began
to hint at enemies he smiled
the children in my orchard said he are
not yet grown tall enough to reach the fruit 
they may throw at it but can bring none
down
do tell me o pericles said i now we
i 
 pericles and aspasia
are inseparable for ever how many struggles
with yourself to say nothing others you
must have had before you attained the position
you have taken
it is pleasant answered he to think
 our glory than the means by which we
acquired it
when we see the horses that have won at
the olympian games do we ask what oats they
have eaten to give them such velocity and
strength do those who swim admirably ever
trouble their minds about the bladders they
swam upon in learning or inquire what beasts
supplied them when the winds are filling our
sails do we lower them and delay our voyage
in order to philosophise on the particles air
composing them or to speculate what region
produced them or what becomes them afterwards

pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
at last aspasia you love indeed the perfections
 your beloved interest you less than
the imperfections which you no sooner take up
for reprehension than you admire embrace
and defend happy happy aspasia but are
you wise and good and equable and fond 
sincerity as formerly nay do not answer
me the gods forbid that i should force you
to be ingenious and love you for it how
much must you have lost before you are praised
for that 
archelaus all our philosophers the most
quiet man and the most patient investigator
will bring you this he desires to be the
hearer anaxagoras
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
i received our countryman with great plea 
sure he was obliged to be my hearer for several
hours i hope his patience will never be
so much tried by anaxagoras i placed them
together at table but anaxagoras would not
break through his custom nothing philosophy
our repast would have been even less
talkative than usual had not anaxagoras asked
our guest whether the earlier milesian authors
poets or historians had mentioned homer
i find not a word about him in any one 
them replied he although we have the
works cadmus and phocyhdes the former
no admirable historian the latter an indifferent
poet but not the less likely to mention him
and they are supposed to have lived within
pericles and aspasia 
three centuries his age permit my first
question to you in my search after truth to be
this whether his age were not much earlier 
this is not the only question said anaxagoras
 on which you will hear from me the
confession my utter ignorance i am interested
in every thing that relates to the operations
 the human mind and pericles has in
his possession every author whose works have
been transcribed the number will appear
quite incredible to you there cannot be fewer
than two hundred i find poetry to which is
attributed an earlier date than to homer's but
stupidity and barbarism are no convincing
proofs i find cretan ionian laconia and
boeotian written certainly more than three centuries
ago the language is not copious is not
fluent is not refined pericles says it is all 
it inharmonious this i cannot judge he
can provides and minerals wrote no better
 pericles and aspasia
verses than the servantgirls sing upon our staircases
archilochus and alcman who lived a
century earlier composed much grander but
where there is at once ferocity and immodesty
either the age must have been barbarous or the
poet must have been left behind it sappho
was in reality the reviver poetry teaching it
to humanize and delight simonides brought
it to perfection the muse lesbos as she
is called and alcaeus invented each a novel
species strophe aspasia prefers the poetry
 sappho and the metre alcaeus which
however i think she informs us is less adapted
to her subjects than her own is
it appears to me said i that every one
who felt strong in poetry was ambitious being
an inventor in its measures archilochus the
last any note had invented the iambic
true o aspasia said pericles but
not exactly in the sense usually received he
pericles and aspasia 
did not invent as many suppose the sectarian
iambic which is coeval almost with the language
itself and many which creep into the
closest prose composition but he was the first
who subjoined a shorter to it the barb to the
dart so fatal to globule and lycambes
his first said i is like the trot a
mastiff his second is like the spring at the
throat
homer alone has enriched the language
with sentences full harmony how long his
verse was created how long his gods had lived
before him how long he himself before us
is yet uncertain although herodotus is opinion
that he is nearer to us than pericles and
anaxagoras admit but these two philosophers
place sun moon and stars beyond all reasonable
limits i know not how far off
we none us know said pericles but
anaxagoras hopes that in a future age human
i 
 pericles and aspasia
knowledge will be more extensive and more
correct and meton has encouraged us in our
speculations the heavenly bodies may keep
their secrets two or three thousand years more
but one or other will betray them to some
wakeful favourite some endymion beyond latmos
perhaps in regions undiscovered certainly
in uncalculated times men will know
more them than they will ever know 
homer our knowledge on this miracle our
species is unlikely to increase
aspasia to cleone
pericles who is acknowledged to have a
finer ear than any our poets or rhetoricians
is opinion that the versification in all the
books both iliad and odyssea was modus
and aspasia 
lated by the same masterkey sophocles too
certainly less jolted than you would suppose by
the deep ruts angular turns and incessant jerks
 the iambic tells me that he finds no other
heroick verses at all resembling it in the
rhythm and that to his apprehension it is not
dissimilar in the two poems
but i must continue while i remember them
perfectly the words pericles
the ulysses the iliad and odyssea is
not the same but the homer is might not
the poet have collected in his earlier voyages
many wonderful tales about the chieftain 
ithaca about his wanderings and return 
about his wife and her suitors might not
afterwards the son or grandson have solicited
his guest and friend to place the sagacious the
courageous the enduring man among the
others whom he was celebrating in detached
poems as leaders against troy he describes
 pericles and aspasia
with precision every thing in ithaca it is evident
he must have been upon the spot all
other countries sicily italy phrygia
he quite as evidently writes from tradition and
representation phrygia was subject to the
assyrian kings at the time when he commences
his siege the greeks according to him had
been ravaging the country many years and had
swept away many cities what were the assyrian
kings doing did the grecians lose nomen
by war by climate by disease by time in
the whole ten years their horses must have
been strong and longlived an excellent breed 
to keep their teeth and mettle for fiveandtwenty
i should have imagined that some 
them must have got lamed some few perhaps
foundered surely here and there a chariot can
have had but one remaining and he in all probability
not in the very best condition how
happened it that the trojans had greek names
pericles and aspasia 
and the leader the greeks an egyptian one 
when i was at byzantion i had the curiosity
to visit the imaginary scene their battles i
saw many sepulchral monuments the most
durable kind conical elevations earth
on which there were sheep and goats at pasture
there were ruins beyond but neither
 a great city nor an ancient one the
only ancient walls i saw were on the european
coast those byzantion which aspasia claims
as the structure miletus and which the
people megara tell us were founded by their
forefathers less than two centuries ago but
neither miletus nor megara was built when
these walls were entire they belong to the
unknown world and are sometimes called pelasgian
sometimes cyclopian appellations
without meaning signs that signify nothing
inscriptions that point out the road to places
 pericles and aspasia
where there is neither place nor road walls
 this massive structure surround the ruins 
phocoea destroyed by cyrus they are also
found in etruria
cleon are you tired rest then
aspasia to cleone
several times had pericles been silent expecting
and inviting our guests to assist him in
the investigation
i have no paradox to maintain no partiality
to defend said he some tell us that
there were twenty homers some deny that
there was ever one it were idle and foolish to
shake the contents a vase in order to let
them settle at last we are perpetually lapericles
and aspasia 
boring to destroy our delight our composure
our devotion to superior power all the
animals upon earth we least know what is good
for us my opinion is that what is best for us
is our admiration good no man living
venerates homer more than i do he was the
only author i read when i was a boy for our
teachers are usually opinion that wisdom
and poetry are like fruit for children unwholesome
if too fresh simonides had indeed grown
somewhat sound pindar was heating aeschylus
 ay but eschylus was almost at the next
door homer then nourished my fancy animated
my dreams awoke me in the morning
marched with me sailed with me taught me
morals taught me languages taught me music
and philosophy and war
ah were he present at this hour among
us that i might ask him how his deities entered
troy in phrygia there was but one
 pericles and aspasia
goddess the mother all the gods cybele
unlike our mortal mothers she was displeased
if you noticed her children indeed she disowned
them her dignity her consequence
her high antiquity induced the natives the
islands and afterwards the other greeks to
place their little gods under her protection
and to call her their mother jupiter had his
ida but not the phrygian and pallas was
worshipped in her citadels but not above the
streams similis and salamander our holy
religion has not yet found its way far beyond
us like the myrtle and olive it loves the seaair
and flourishes but upon few mountains in
the interior the cabiri still hold samothrace
and we may almost hear the cries 
human victims in the north
if there were any true history the times
we are exploring perhaps we might find in it
that many excursions combined and simulta
pericles and aspasia 
nous had utterly failed and that the disasters
 many chiefs engaged in them were partly
concealed from the nations they governed by
the sacred veil poetry those who are
reputed to have sailed against troy none returned
prosperous none with the men he had
led out most were forbidden to land again
upon their native shores and some who attempted
it were slain such is usually the fate
 the unsuccessful it is more probable that
the second great naval expedition the greeks
went out to avenge the disasters the first
the argonauts and the result was nearly the
same the argonauts few returned sparta
lost her castor and pollux thessaly her jason 
and i am more disposed to believe that the
head orpheus rolled down the phases than
down the hebrus
the poets gave successes which the gods
denied but these things concern us little
 pericles and aspasia
the poet is what we seek needless is it to remark
that the iliad is a work much reflection
and various knowledge the odyssea is the
marvellous result a vivid and wild imagination
aspasia prefers it homer in nearly
the thirty years which i conceive to have intervened
between the fanciful work and the
graver had totally lost his pleasantries polyphemus
could amuse him no longer circe
lighted up in vain her fires cedarwood calypso
had lost her charms her maidens were
mute around her the lestrigons lay asleep
the syrens sang
come hither o passer by come hither
o glory the chains 
and the smooth waves quivered with the sound
but the harp the old man had no chord
that vibrated
in the odyssea he invokes the muse in
pericles and aspasia 
the iliad he invokes her as a goddess he had
invoked before he begins the odyssea as the
tale a family to which he would listen as
she rehearsed it the iliad as a song warriors
and divinities worthy the goddess herself
to sing before the world
demonstrate that metaphors are discoverable
drawn from things believed to have been
invented in the homeric age what does it
prove merely that homer who lived among
the islands and among those who had travelled
into all the known regions the world had
collected more knowledge than the shepherds
and boarhunters on the continent
demonstrate that some books in the compilation
retain slight traces a language not
exactly the same as the others what then
might they not have been composed while he
visited countries in which that dialect was indigenous
or might they not have been found there
 pericles and aspasia
at the first collection the songs having undergone
some modification from the singers adapted
to the usages and phraseology the people 
alio doubts that what was illegible or obscure
in the time lycurgus was rendered
clearer by the learned spartan that some
cretan words not the dorian sparta had
crept in that others were substituted that
solon pisistratus and hipparchus had also to
correct a few these corrections and many
things more they found a series songs 
never was there a series such length without
an oversight or gap
shall the alpine be sounded in my ear 
homer may have introduced it by way allusion
in one poem not wanting it in the other
the grecians his time never used it in
battle eastern nations did and perhaps had
he known the phrygian better its blasts would
have sounded on the plains troy he would
pericles and aspasia 
have discovered that trumpets had been used
among them for many ages we possess no
knowledge any nation who cultivated the
science musick so early or employed so
great a variety wind instruments little did
he know phrygia and as little do we know
 him his beautiful creation lies displayed
before us the creator is hidden in his own
splendour i can more easily believe that his
hand constructed the whole than that twenty
men could be found at nearly the same time
each genius sufficient for the twentieth part 
because in many centuries there arose not a
single one capable such a production as that
portion
archilochus and simonides are excellent
only in their shorter poems they could not
have whistled so well throughout a long march
difficulties are to be overcome on both sides
we have no grammarians worthy the 
pericles and aspasia
nation none in any district greece hath
studied the origin and etymology his language
we sing like the birds equally ignorant
whence our voice arises what is worse
we are fonder theories than truth and believe
that we have not room enough to build
up any thing until we subvert what we find before
us be it so but let it be only what is
obnoxious what opposes our reason what disturbs
our tranquillity mind not what shows
us the extent the one the potency the
other and consoling us for being mortal assures
us that our structures may be as durable
as those the gods themselves the name 
homer will be venerated as long as the honest
 theirs i dare not say longer i dare not say
by wiser men i hope i am guilty no impiety
 i should aggravate it by lowering homer
the loftiest their works
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
aristophanes often dines with us nevertheless
he is secretly an enemy pericles and
fearing to offend him personally is satirical on
most our friends meton whose character
you know already great in astronomy great in
geometry great in architecture was consulted
by pericles on beautifying the streets the
city which are close and crooked no sooner
had aristophanes heard this than he began to
compose a comedy entitled the birds he
has here represented our quiet contemplative
meton with a rule and compass in his hands
uttering the most ludicrous absurdities meton
is a plain unassuming inoffensive man and
never speaks inconsiderately the character
is clumsily drawn but that fault was easily
 pericles and aspasia
corrected by representing poor meton under
the chastisement the cudgel there is so
much wit in this i doubt whether any audience
can resist it there is magick in every stroke
and what was amiss is mended and made whole
again ere the hammer falls how easy a way
 setting all things to rights with only one
dissentient voice 
in the same comedy is ridiculed the project
 pericles on a conformity weights and
measures in attica and her dependencies
more wit another beating 
when aristophanes made us the next visit
pericles after greeting him with much goodnature
and after various conversation with him
seemed suddenly to recollect something and
with more familiarity than usual took him
gently by the elbow led him a little aside and
said with a smile and in a low voice
my dear friend aristophanes i find you
pericles and aspasia 
are by no means willing to receive the same
measure as you give but remember the people
have ordered the adjustment the surest preservative
against fraud particularly that by
which the poorer are mostly the sufferers
take care they do not impeach you knowing
as you do how inefficient is my protection it
is chiefly on such an occasion i should be sorry
to be in a minority
aristophanes blushed and looked alarmed pericles
took him by the hand whispering in his
ear do not let us enter into a conspiracy
against equity by attacking the uniformity 
weights and measures nor against comedy by
giving the magistrates a pretext to forbid its
representation
aristophanes turned toward pantarces who
stood near him and said
i can write a comedy as well as most pericles
can act one better than any
vol i k
 pericles and aspasia
aristophanes in my opinion might have
easily been the first ijrric poet now having except
sophocles and euripides he chose rather to
be the bitterest satirist how many adorned
with all the rarities intellect have stumbled
on the entrance into life and have made a wrong
choice in the very thing which was to determine
their course for ever this is among the reasons
and perhaps is the principal one why the
wise and the happy are two distinct classes 
men
aspasia to cleone
i had retired before aristophanes went home
on my return it was evident that some one
present had indeed against the poet's effrontery
for i was in time to catch these words 
pericles
pericles and aspasia 
why should i be angry with the writers 
comedy is it because they tell me the
faults i find in myself surely not for he who
finds them in himself may be quite certain that
others have found them in him long before and
have shown much forbearance in the delay
is it because i am told those i have not
discovered in me foolish indeed were this
i am to be angry it seems because a man forewarns
me that i have enemies in my chamber
who will stab me when they find me asleep and
because he helps me to catch them and disarm
them
but it is such an indignity to be ridiculed 
i incurred a greater when i threw myself into
the way ridicule a greater still should i
suffer if i tried whether it could be remedied
by resentment
ridicule often parries resentment but resentment
never yet parried ridicule
k
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to herodotus
herodotus if there is any one who admires
your writings more than another it is i no
residence in attica will ever make me prefer
the dialect to ours no writer will charm my
ear as you have done and yet you cannot bring
me to believe that the sun is driven out his
course by storms nor any the consequences
you deduce from it occasioning the overflow 
the nile the opinion you consider as unfounded
namely that it arises from the melting
 the snows and from the periodical rains on
the mountains ethiopia is however that 
pericles and anaxagoras who attribute it also
to thales in their estimation the soundest and
shrewdest philosophers they appear to
have very strange notions about the sun about
his magnitude his position and distance and
pericles and aspasia 
i doubt whether you could persuade them that
the three stoutest winds are able to move him
one furlong i am a great doubter you see
but they i do assure you are greater pericles
is opinion that natural philosophy has
made but little progress and yet that many
more discoveries have burst open before the
strenuous inquirer than have been manifested
to the world that some have been supprest by
a fear the publick and some by a contempt
for it
in the intellectual said he as in the
physical men grasp you firmly and tenaciously
by the hand creeping close at your side step
for step while you lead them into darkness
but when you conduct them into sudden light
they start and quit you
o herodotus may your life and departure
be happy but how can it be expected no
other deities have ever received such honours
 pericles and aspasia
as you have conferred upon the muses and
alas how inefficient are they to reward or protect
their votaries 
cleone to aspasia
the tragedy phrynicus on the devastation
 our city by the persians will outlast all the
cities now flourishing on earth heavy was the
mulct to which the poet was condemned by the
athenians for the tears he drew from them in
the theatre
is it not remarkable that we have never found
any milesian poem on the same subject surely
there must have been several within how
this tragedy which produced a more powerful
effect than any other on record has failed however to
fulfil the prophecy cleon the ode aletheia on
which she places so small a value has outlived it
pericles and aspasia 
short a period have they perished lately in
searching the houses such inhabitants as
were suspected partiality to the interests 
lacedaemon these verses were discovered
they bear the signature aletheia daughter
 charades and stage
we have often heard her story often have
we sat upon the mound ruins under which
she lies buried often have we plucked from it
the white cyclamen sweetest all sweet odours
and played with its stiff reverted little horns
pouring forth a parsimonious fragrance won
only when we applied to them tenderly and
closely
whether poor aletheia gave for life more
than life's value it were worse than curiosity to
inquire she loved her deliverer and at the
instigation many less gentle she was slain
for loving him when the city was again in
possession the citizens she was stoned to
 pericles and aspasia
death for favouring the invader and her mother
rushed forward and shared it these are
things you know her poem her only one extant
you do not you will find in it little 
poetry but much what is better and rarer
true affection
aletheia to phraortes

phraortes where art thou 
the flames were panting after us their darts
had pierced to many hearts
before the gods who heard nor prayer nor vow 

temples had sunk to earth and other smoke
o'er riven altars broke
than curled from myrrh and nard
when like a god among
arm'd host and unarm'd throng
thee i discern'd implored and caught one brief regard
pericles and aspasia 

thou passes from thy side
sudden two bowmen ride
and hurry me away
thou and all hope were gone 
they lost me and alone
in a closed tent mid gory arms i lay

how did my tears then burn
when dreading thy return
behold thee reappear 
nor helm nor sword nor spear 

in violet goldhem'd vest
thou comest forth too soon 
fallen at thy feet clasps to thy breast
i struggle sob and swoon

o send me to my mother bid her come
and take my last farewell 
one blow enough for both one tomb 
tis there our happy dwell
k
 pericles and aspasia

thou orders call'd and gone
at once are they who breathe for thy command
thou stoutest nigh me soothing every moan
and pressing in both thine my hand

then and then only when it tore
my hair to hide my face 
and gently did thy own bend o'er
the abject head wardoom'd to dire disgrace

ionian was thy tongue
and when thou basest me to raise
that head nor fear in aught thy gaze
i dared look up but dared not long

 wait maiden wait if none are here
bearing a charm to charm a tear
there may who knows be found at last
some solace for the sorrow past
pericles and aspasia 

my mother ere the sounds had least
burst in and drew me down 
her joy o'erpowered us both her breast
covered lost friends and ruin'd town

sweet thought but yielding now
to many harsher by what blow
art thou dissevered from me war
that hath career too far
closet his pinions come phraortes come
to thy fond friends at home 

thus beckons love away then wishes wild 
o may thy mother be as blest
as one whose eyes will sink to rest
blessing thee for her rescued child i

ungenerous still my heart must be 
throughout the young and festive train
which thou revisited again
may none be happier this i fear than she i
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
perhaps i like the ode aletheia more than
you do because you sent it me and you perhaps
would have liked it more than i had i
sent it you there are writings which must lie
long upon the straw before they mellow to the
taste and there are summer fruits that cannot
abide the keeping
my heart assures me that aletheia had she
lived might have excelled in poetry and the
loss a lover is a help to it we must defer
our attempts to ascertain her station in the
world poetry for we never see the just dimensions
 what is close before our eyes
faults are best discovered near and beauties
at some distance
aletheia who found favour with cleon is
pericles and aspasia 
surely not unworthy to take her seat in the
library pericles
i will look for a cyclamen to place within the
scroll i must find it and gather it and place
it there myself sweet hapless aletheia 
aspasia to cleone
nothing is pleasant to me than exploring
in a library what a delight in being a discoverer
 among a loose accumulation 
poetry the greater part excessively bad the
verses i am about to transcribe are perhaps the
least so
life passes not as some men say
if you will only urge his stay
and treat him kindly all the while
 pericles and aspasia
he flies the dizzy strife towns
cowers before thunderbearing frowns
but freshens up again at song and smile
arcadia we will place him here
and promise that nor sigh nor tear
shall ever trouble his repose
what precious seal will you impress
to ratify his happiness 
that rose thro which you breathe come bring
that rose
aspasia to cleone
knowing how desirous i have always been
to learn the history athens for these last
fifty years and chiefly that part it in which
my pericles has partaken so largely and to
pericles and aspasia 
reward my forbearance in abstaining from
every close and importunate inquiry he
placed a scrap paper in my hands this
morning
read that said he
it was no easy matter few sentences would
have been legible without my interpreter indeed
there were not many erased
this speech replied he occupied me
one whole night and somewhat the next
morning i had so very much not to say
aware that the party cimon would interest
the people in his behalf so that a leader
from among his relatives or friends might be
proposed and brought forward pericles was
resolved to anticipate these exertions see his
few words
we have lost o athenians not a town
nor a battle these you would soon regain but
 pericles and aspasia
we have lost a great man a true lover his
country cimon son miltiades
i well remember the grief you manifested
at the necessity removing him for a time
from among the insidious men who would have
worked upon his generous temper ductile as
gold never could i have believed i had sufficient
interest with some i see before me firm
almost unto hardness whose patriotism and probity
had been the most alarmed but they
listened to me with patience and revoked the
sentence banishment cimon returned from
sparta took the command your armies vanquished
the persians and imposed on them
such conditions as will humble their pride forever

our fathers were ungenerous to his we
will as becomes us pay their debts and remove
the dust from their memory miltiades
pericles and aspasia 
was always great and only once unsuccessful 
cimon was greater and never unfortunate butin
the temporary privation your affections
history offers us no example so consummate
a commander
i propose that a statue be erected to cimon
son miltiades vanquisher the persians
aspasia to cleone
there are secrets which not even love should
try to penetrate i am afraid knowing who
caused the banishment cimon certainly he
was impeached by pericles who nevertheless
praised him highly whenever his name was
mentioned he has allowed me to transcribe
his speech after the sentence the judges and
with it his letter recall
 pericles and aspasia
to the athenians
on the banishment cimon
in your wisdom o athenians you have decreed
that cimon son miltiades be exiled
from our city
whatever may have been the errors or the
crimes cimon much them should in justice
to yourselves and in humanity to the prosecuted
be ascribed to the perversity that
faction which never ceases or relaxes in its
attempts to thwart your determinations and to
deprive you authority at home respect in
the sight greece
but i adjure you to remember the services
both cimon and miltiades and to afford
the banished man no reason or plea to call in
question your liberality permit the rents 
his many farms in attica to be carried to him
pericles and aspasia 
in sparta and let it never be said that a citizen
 athens was obliged to the most illiberal and
penurious people for a sustenance not indeed
that there is any danger sparta entertaining
him too honourably she may pay for
services but rather for those which are to be
performed than for those which have been and
to the man rather who may do her harm than
to him who can do it no longer
let us hope that at some future day cimon
may be aware his mistake and regard with
more veneration the image his father than
the throne his father's enemy
letter pericles to cimon
there are few cities o cimon that have
men for their inhabitants whatever is out 
greece and not grecian is nearer the animal
world than the intellectual some even in
 pericles and aspasia
greece are but midway leave them behind
you return to your country and conquer her
assailants wholesome is the wisdom that we
have gathered from misfortune sweet the repose
that dwells upon renown and beautiful the
life that is the peristyle immortality
speech pericles
on the defection euboea and megara
euboea has rejected our authority and alliance
megara our friendship under what pretext
 that we have employed in the decoration
 our city the sums money they stipulated
to contribute annually a subsidy to
resist the persians what must we continue
a war extermination with persia when she
no longer has the power to molest us when
peace has been sworn and proclaimed do
we violate the compact with our confederates 
pericles and aspasia 
no men athens our fleets are in harbour
every ship in good condition our arsenals
are wellstored and we are as prompt and
as able now to repel aggression as we ever
were
are our dues then to be withhold from
us because we have anticipated our engagements
because our navy and our army are in
readiness before they are wanted because
while our ungrateful allies were plotting our
ruin we were watching over their interests and
providing for their security states like private
men are subject to the distemper ingratitude
erasing from the memory the impression
 past benefits but it appears to be peculiar
to the megarians to recompense them with
hatred and animosity not only have we protected
them from aggression by building for
them the very walls from which they now defy
us but when antonius sent against them at
 pericles and aspasia
mount cithseron the whole force the median
cavalry under the command majesties and
when they called aloud to every near battalion
 the grecian army and when pausanias in
vain repeated the exhortation three hundred
athenians led by olympiodorus son lampon
threw themselves forward from erythrae
and after losing many brave comrades rescued
from imminent death the fathers those degenerate
men who are now in the vanguard
 conspirators against us ingratitude maybe
left to the chastisement the gods but
the sword must consolidate broken treaties no
state can be respected if fragment after fragment
may be detached from it with impunity 
if traitors are permitted to delude and discompose
the contented and to seduce the ignorant
from their allegiance if loyalty is proclaimed a
weakness sedition a duty conspiracy wisdom
and rebellion heroism it is a crime then for
pericles and aspasia 
us to embellish our city it is a reproach to enlarge
and fortify our harbours in vain have
we represented to the clamorous and refractory
that their annual contributions are partly due
to us for past exertions and partly the price 
our protection at this time and in future and
not against persia only but against pirates
our enemies have persuaded them that rebellion
and war are better things our enemies
who were lately theirs and who by this perfidious
instigation are about to become so more
cruelly than ever are athenians avaricious 
are athenians oppressive even the slaves
in our city have easier access to the comforts
and delights life than the citizens almost
any other until late the megarians were
proud our consanguinity and refused to be
called the descendants apollo in hopes to
be acknowledged as the children panton
although in later times they became the allies
 pericles and aspasia
 sparta they cannot but remember that we
have always been their friends often their deliverers
 and it is only for their dishonesty and
perfidy that we now are resolved at last to prohibit
them from the advantages our ports
sparta and corinth have instigated them
corinth whose pride and injustice have excited
corcyra with her fleets to seek deliverance in
the piraeus what have we to fear from so
strange a union as that corinth and sparta 
are any two nations so unlike so little formed
for mutual succour or for mutual esteem 
hitherto we have shared both our wealth and
our dangers with euboea at the conclusion
 a successful war at the signature a most
honourable and advantageous peace we are
derided and reproached what is it they discover
to despise in us i will tell you what it
is it is the timid step blind men this
they saw in us while they were tampering with
pericles and aspasia 
sparta not ashamed their seduction they
now walk hand in hand with open front and
call others to join in their infamy they have
renounced our amity they have spurned our expostulations
they have torn our treaties and
they have defied our arms at the peril 
being called a bad citizen i lament your blindness
o megara and euboea 
aspasia to cleone
i find among the few records in my hands
that pericles went in person and conquered
the faithless megara and the refractory euboea
before he sailed to attack the island he warned
the athenians against an inconsiderate parsimony
which usually terminates in fruitless expenditure
he told them plainly that euboea
was capable a protracted and obstinate re
vol i l
 pericles and aspasia
distance and he admonished them that whatever
reverses the arms athens might experience
they should continue the war and consider
the dominion the island a thing necessary
to their existence as a nation that whoever
should devise or counsel the separation 
euboea from athens be declared guilty treason
and punished with death
if thebes in a future war said he
should take possession this productive
country and shut up as she easily might the
passage the euripus she would gain an
ascendency over us from which we never could
recover losses defeats inadequate supplies
may tempt her she would always have sparta
for an allie on such an occasion indeed it is
wonderful that the boeotian as brave a race 
men as any in greece and stronger in the
body should not have been her masters perhaps
it is the fertility her own territory that
pericles and aspasia 
kept her content with her possessions and indisposed
the cultivators so rich a soil from
enterprise and hazard euboea is no less fertile
than boeotia from which she is separated by
the distance a stone's throw give me fifty
gallies and five thousand men and euboea shall
fall ere sparta can come to her assistance
aspasia to cleone
perpetual as have been the wars attica
she is overpeopled a colony hoisted sail for
the chersonese another to repeople the ruined
walls sybaris happy the families whose
fathers give them lands to cultivate instead 
keeping them in idleness at home such are the
founders colonies the language this
city is spoken in italy in sicily in asia in

 pericles and aspasia
africa and even on the coast gaul among
the yelping and yells timbers and chambers
surely the more beneficent the gods must
look down with delight on these fruittrees
planted in the forest may the healthiest
dews heaven descend upon them 
we are now busied in the propylaea they
although unfinished are truly magnificent
which will remain the longest the traces the
walls or the colonies the future we
know nothing the past little the present
less the mirrour is too close to our eyes and
our own breath dims it
cleone to aspasia
i have only time to send you a few perfumes
and a few verses these i transcribe out a
pericles and aspasia 
little volume erinna the perfumes came tome
from syria
blessed be the man whose beneficent providence
gave the flowers another life we seem
to retain their love when their beauty has departed

erinna to leuconoe
if comfort is unwelcome can i think
reproof aught less will be 
the cup i bring to cool thee wilt thou drink
fever'd leuconoe 
rather with grief than friendship wouldst thou dwell
because love smiles no more 
bent down by culling bitter herbs to swell
a cauldron that boils o'er
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
thanks for the verses i hope leuconoe
was as grateful as i am and as sensible to their
power soothing
thanks too for the perfumes pericles is
ashamed acknowledging he is fond them 
but i am resolved to betray one secret his 
i have caught him several times trying them
as he called it
how many things are there that people pretend
to dislike without any reason as far as we
know for the dislike or the pretence 
i love sweet odours surely my cleon herself
must have breathed her very soul into these 
let me smell them again let me inhale them
into the sanctuary my breast lighted up by
her love for their reception
but ah cleon what an importunate and
pericles and aspasia 
exacting creature is aspasia have you no
willows freshpeeled none lying upon the
bank for baskets white rounded and delicate
as your fingers how very fragrant they were
formerly i have seen none lately do you
remember the cross old hermesionax how be
ran to beat us for breaking his twigs and how
after looking in our faces he seated himself
down again finished his basket disbursed from
a goatskin a corroded clod rancid cheese
put it in pushed it to us forced it under my
arm told us to carry it home with the gods 
and lifted up both hands and blest us
i do not wish that one exactly cheese is the
cruellest deaths to me and pericles abhors
it
i am running over trifling occurrences which
you must have forgotten you are upon the
spot and have no occasion to recall to memory
how the munificent old basketmaker looked
 pericles and aspasia
after us not seeing his dog at our heels
how we coaxed the lean shaggy suspicious
animal how many devices we contrived to
throw down or let slip so that the good man
might not see it the pestilence you insisted on
carrying how many names we called the dog
by ere we found the true one cyrus how
when we had drawn him behind the lentiscus
we rewarded him for his assiduities holding
each an ear nevertheless that he might not
carry back the gift to his master and how we
laughed at our fears when a single jerk the
head served at once to ingulph the treasure and
to disengage him
i shall always love the smell the peeled
willow have you none for me is there no
young poplar then with a tear in his eye on
bursting into bud i am not speaking by metaphor
and critically i want the poplars the
willows the waterlilies and the soft green
pericles and aspasia 
herbage how we enjoyed it on the meander 
what liberties we took with it robbing it 
the flowers it had educated those it was
rearing those that came confidently out to
meet us and those that hid themselves 
none escaped us for these remembrances
green is the colour i love best it brings me
to the fortunate island and my cleon it
brings me back to childhood the proud little
nurse youth brighter eye and lighter 
heart than youth herself
these are not regrets cleon they are respirations
necessary to existence you may call
them halfwishes if you will we are poor indeed
when we have no halfwishes left us the
heart and the imagination close the shutters the
instant they are gone
do not chide me then for coming to you after
the blossoms and buds and herbage do not
keep to yourself all the grass on the meander
l
 pericles and aspasia
we used to share it we will now i love it
wherever i can get a glimpse it it is the
home the eyes ever ready to receive them
and spreading its cool couch for their repose
cleone to aspasia
demophile poor honest faithful creature 
has yielded to her infirmities i have spent
almost as many hours with her in these last
autumnal months as i did in the earliest my
existence she could not carry me in her arms
again but she was happy when mine were about
her neck and said they made her stronger
do you remember how often she dropt my
hand to take yours because you never cried 
saying
people never weep nor work themselves
pericles and aspasia 
who can make others weep and work for them
that little one will have weeper and worker
too about her presently look at her cleon 
cannot you look like that have not you two
lips and two eyes aspasia has not three try
now mind how i do it 
good simple heart 
when she was near her she said to me
do you ever go and read those names and
bits verses on the stones yonder you and
aspasia used formerly some them tell us to
be sad and sorry for folks who died a hundred
years ago others to imitate men and w omen we
never should have had a chance seeing had
they been living yet all we can learn from themis
this that our city never had any bad people
in it but has been filled with weeping and wailing
from its foundation upwards
these things puzzled demophile she was
somewhat vext that she could not well compress
pericles and aspasia
lend them but praised the gods that our
house was safe when many others must have
been rent asunder such a power lamentation

my name said she i believe is a very
difficult and troublesome one to pinfold in a
tombstone nobody has ever tried how it would
sound in verse but if you and aspasia think
me w orth remembering i am sure you could do
more with it than others could and you would
lead your little ones when the gods have given
you any to come and see it and tell them many
things old demophile
i assured her that if i outlived her i would
prove in the manner she wished that my memory
and love outlived her likewise
she died two days afterwards
nothing is difficult not even an epitaph if
we prefer the thoughts that come without calling
and receive the first as the best and truest
pericles and aspasia 
i would not close my eyes to sleep until i had
performed my promise
demophile rests here we will not say
that she was aged lest ye turn away 
nor that she long had suffered early woes
alone can touch you go and pity those 
aspasia to cleone
ah poor demophile she remembered me
then how sorry i am i cannot tell her i remember
her 
cleon there are little things that leave no
little regrets i might have said kind words
and perhaps have done kind actions to many
who now are beyond the reach them one
look on the unfortunate might have given a
day's happiness one sigh over the pillow 
 pericles and aspasia
sickness might have ensured a night's repose 
one whisper might have driven from their victim
the furies despair
we think too much upon ivhat the gods
have given us and too utile why
we both are young and yet we have seen
several who loved us pass away and we cannot
live over again as we lived before a portion
 our lives is consumed by the torch we follow
at their funerals we enter into another state
 existence resembling indeed and partaking
 the former but another it contains the
substance the same sorrows the shadow 
the same joys alas how true are the words
 the old poet
we lose a life in every friend we lose
and every death is painful but the last
i often think my beautiful nurse myrtle
now married very happily in clazomene my
pericles and aspasia 
first verses were upon her these are the
verses i thought so good that i wrote a long
dissertation on the trochaick meter to prove
it the most magnificent meters and i mentioned
in it all the poets that ever wrote from
epigrammatic to epick praising some and censuring
others a judge without appeal upon all
how you laughed at me do you remember
the lines i wonder they are not worse
than they are
myrtle may heaven reward thee
for thy tenderness and care 
dressing me in ail thy virtues
docile duteous gentle fair
one alone thou never heeded
i can boast that one alone 
grateful beats the heart thy nursling
myrtle tis all thy own
 pericles and aspasia
pericles to aspasia
receive old locris and treat her affably
she has much influence in her tribe the
elderly your sex possess no small authority
in our city and i suspect that in others too
they have their sway she made me tremble
once pilots asked her how she liked my
speech i forget upon what occasion she answered

his words are current words and ring
well but unless he gives us more them for
the trouble our attendance he shall not be
archon i promise him
now i know not how long i could protract a
speech nor how long i could keep my head
under water these are accomplishments i have
never studied locris and i are still friends
pericles and aspasia 
however in my favour she has waved her promise
and lets me be archon
pericles to aspasia
send me a note whenever you are idle and
thinking me dear aspasia send it always
by some old slave illdrest the people will
think it a petition or something as good and
they will be sure to observe the pleasure it
throws into my countenance two winds at
once will blow into my sails each helping me
onward
if i am tired your letter will refresh me if
occupied it will give me activity beside
what a deal time we lose in business 
plutarch says he never was archon he means
perhaps ri archon
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to pericles
would to heaven o pericles you had no
business at all but the conversation your
friends you must always be the greatest man in
the city whoever may be the most popular i wish
we could spend the whole day together must
it never be are you not already in possession
 all you ever contended for 
it is time methinks that you should leave
off speaking in publick for you begin to be negligent
and incorrect i am to write you a note
whenever i am idle and thinking you

to think you we come to rest before
we conftp to idleness

in our republick it is no easy thing to obtain
an act divorce from power it usually is
delivered to us by the messenger death or
presented in due form by our judges where the
oyster keeps open house
now oysters are quite out season in the
summer life and life just about this time
i do assure you is often worth keeping i
thought so even before i knew you when i
thought but little about the matter it is a
casket not precious in itself but valuable in
proportion to what fortune or industry or
virtue has placed within it
aspasia to cleone
when pericles is too grave and silent i
usually take up my harp and sing to it for
 pericles and aspasia
musick is often acceptable to the ear when it
would avoid or repose from discourse he tells
me that it not only excites the imagination but
invigorates eloquence and refreshes memory
that playing on my harp to him is like besprinkling
a tessellated pavement with odoriferous
water which brings out the images cools
the apartment and gratifies the senses by its
fragrance
 that instrument said he is the rod 
mercury it calls up the spirits from below or
conducts them back again to elysium with
what ecstacy do i throb and quiver under those
refreshing showers sound 
come sprinkle me soft musick o'er the breast
bring me the varied colours into light
that now obscurely on its tablet rest
shew me its flowers and figures fresh and bright
pericles and aspasia 
waked at thy voice and touch again the chords
restore what restless years had moved away
restore the glowing cheeks the tender words
youth's shortlived spring and pleasure's summerday

i believe he composed these verses while i
was playing although he disowns them asking
me whether i am willing to imagine that my
execution is become so powerless
you remember my old song it was this i
had been playing
song
the reeds were green the other day
among the reeds we loved to play
we loved to play while they were green
the reeds are hard and yellow now
no more their tufted heads they bow
to beckon us behind the scene
 pericles and aspasia
 what is it like my mother said
and laid her hand upon my head 
mother i cannot tell indeed
i've thought all hard things i knows
ive thought all the yellow too 
it only can be like the reed

panenus is our best painter he was educated
by phidias who excels all the painters incorrectness
 design panenus has travelled
into egypt in which country he tells us the
colours are as fresh upon the walls the temples
as when they were painted two thousand years
ago pericles wishes to have a representation
 me in the beginning every olympiad
alas what an imprudence the most youthful
lover never committed one greater
pericles and aspasia 
i will not send a stranger to you cleon i
will send the fugitive miletus when epic
was giving her the lecture in the bath
be quiet now say nothing even the bath
itself is quite imaginary
panenus plays upon the harp i praised
him for the simplicity and melody the
tune and for his execution he was but little
pleased
lady said he to me a painter can be
two things he can be painter and statuary
which is much the easier make him a third
and you reduce him to nothing
yet pericles said i plays rather well
rather well i can believe said he because
i know that his master was damon who
was very skilful and very diligent damon like
every clever composer i have met with or indeed
ever heard was a child in levity and
dissipation his life was half feast half concert
 pericles and aspasia
but panenus said i surely we may be
fond musick and yet stand a little on this
side idiocy
aspasia he replied he who loves not
musick is a beast one species he who overloves
it is a beast another whose brain is
smaller than a nightingale's and his heart thana
lizard's record me one memorable saying
one witticism one just remark any great
musician and i consent to undergo the punishment
 marsyas some among them are innocent
and worthy men not many nor the first
dissipation and what is strange selfishness
and disregard to punctuality in engagements
are common and nearly general in the more
distinguished them
o musick how it grieves me that imprudence
intemperance gluttony should open
their channels into thy sacred stream 
panenus said this let us never believe a word
pericles and aspasia 
 it he himself plays admirably although
no composer
cleone to aspasia
o aspasia have you heard you surely
must that the people samos have declared
war against us it is hardly sixty years since
our beautiful city was captured and destroyed
by the persians in vain hath she risen from
her ashes with fresh splendour another phry
nisus will have perhaps to write another
tragedy upon us
is it an offence to be flourishing and happy 
the unfortunate meet and embrace the fortunate
meet and tear each other to pieces
what wonder that the righteous gods allow to
prosperity so brief a space

be composed and tranquil read the speech
 pericles to the athenians
speech pericles
the milesian it appears have sent embassadors
to you o men athens not entreating
the cooperation your arms but the
interposition your wisdom and integrity
they have not spoken nor indeed can they
deem it necessary to speak dangers recently
undergone together with you ancient faithful
indissoluble alliances or the glory descending
from the same forefathers on this
plea miletus might have claimed as a right
what she solicits as a favour
samos o athenians has dared to declare
war against the people miletus she envies
us our commerce and unable to find a
plea for assailing us strikes our friend in our
pericles and aspasia 
sight and looks impudently in our faces to see
whether we will resent it
no athenians we will not resent it until we
have sent embassadors to ask her why she has
taken up arms against the peaceful and unoffending
it were well were it permitted us
to abstain yes i feel i am hazarding your
favour by recommending delay and procrastination
 but i do not apprehend that we are
losing much time we have weapons we
have ships we have the same soldiers who
quelled braver enemies the vanquished seem
again to be filing up the ranks we have
thinned they murmur they threaten they
conspire they prepare and preparation denounces
it hostility let them come forth
against us wealth rises up to our succour in
that harbour glory stands firm and bids them
defiance on those walls

little becomes it me o athenians to oppose
your wishes or to abate your ardour
depart then heralds and carry with you

aspasia to cleone
i have asked pericles to let me see all his
speeches he declared to me that he has kept
no copies but promised that he would attempt
to recover some them from his friends i
was disappointed and grieved and told him i
was angry with him he answered thus taking
me by the hand
so you really are angry that i have been
negligent in the preservation my speeches
after all my labour in modelling and correcting
them you are anxious that i should be praised
as a writer by writers who direct the publick
pericles and aspasia 
in these matters aspasia i know their
value understand me correctly and comprehensively
i mean partly the intrinsick worth
 their commendations and partly as we pay
in the price our utensils the fashion i have
been accused squandering away both the
publick money and my own nobody shall ever
accuse me paying three obols for the most
grandly embossed and most sonorous panegyrick
i would excite the pleasure it were
too much to say the admiration judicious
and thoughtful men but i would neither soothe
nor irritate these busybodies i have neither
honey nor lime for ants we know that good
writers are often gratified by the commendation
 bad ones and that even when the learned
and intelligent have brought the materials
to crown their merits they have looked toward
the door at some petulant smirking page for
the thread that was to bind the chaplet little do
 pericles and aspasia
i wish to hear what i am much less what i am
not enough for me to feel the consciousness
and effect health and strength surely it is
better than to be told by those who salute me
that i am looking very well
you may reply that the question turns not
upon compliments but upon censure
really i know not what my censurers may
write never having had the advantage reading
their lucubrations all i know is this if i am
not their pericles i am at least the pericles 
aspasia and the athenians
aspasia to cleone
we were conversing on oratory and orators
when anaxagoras said looking at pericles and
smiling
they are described by hesiod in two verses
which he applies to himself and the poets 
pericles and aspasia 
lies very like the truth we tell
and when we wish it truth as well
meton relaxed from his usual seriousness but
had no suspicion the application although he
said
 cleverly applied indeed 
pericles enjoyed equally the simplicity 
meton and the slyness anaxagoras and said
meton our friend anaxagoras is so modest
a man that the least we can do for him is to
acknowledge his claims as heir general to
hesiod see them registered
i have never observed the temper pericles
either above or below the enjoyment a joke 
he invites and retaliates but never begins lest
he should appear to take a liberty
there are proud men so much delicacy
that it almost conceals their pride and perfectly
excuses it
 pericles and aspasia
meton never talks but answers questions
with great politeness although with less clearness
and precision than you would expect i
remarked to him one evening that mathematicians
had great advantages over others in disputation
from the habitude they had acquired
 exactness in solving their problems
we mathematicians answered he lay
claim to this precision i need not mention to
you aspasia that all the people who assemble
at your house i am the only one that
ever wants a thought or word we are exact
in our own proper workmanship give us time
and we can discover what is false in logick 
but i never was acquainted with a mathematician
who was ready in correcting in himself a
flaw ratiocination or who produced the fitting
thing in any moderate time composition is
quite beyond our sphere i am not envious 
others but i often regret in myself that while
pericles and aspasia 
they are delivering their opinions freely and
easily i am arranging mine and that in common
with all the mathematicians my acquaintance
i am no prompt debater no acute
logician no clear expositor but begin in hesitation
and finish in confusion
i assure you cleon i have been obliged to
give order and regularity to these few words 
the wise contemplative meton and to remove
from among them many that were superfluous
and repeated when he had paused i told him
i sometimes wished he would exercise his
powerful mind in conversation
i have hardly time said he for study
much less for disputation rarely have i known
a disputant who however dexterous did not
either drive by truth or over her or who stopped
to salute her unless he had something fine or
novel to display he would stumble over my
cubes and spheres and i should leave my leg
in his noose
m 
 pericles and aspasia
and yet anaxagoras and you agree well
together said i
anaxagoras replied he usually asks me
short questions and helps me himself to explain
them he comes to me when i am alone
and would find no pleasure in showing to others
my perplexity seldom do i let him go again
until he has given me some help or some incitement
in my studies he suggests many
things
silence good meton cried anaxagoras
or i may begin to talk a luminary whose
light has not yet reached the earth
the three men smiled they have some meaning
communicated to me perhaps it is a remark
 pericles in encouragement anaxagoras
that while others pass before us like a
halfobol towlink across a dark alley and
dazzle and disappear his loftier light has not
yet come down to the intellects his fellowpericles
and aspasia 
citizens or perhaps it may really have a reference
to some discovery in astronomy
pericles goes in person to command the expedition
against samos he promises me it
will soon be ready to sail and tells me to expect
him back again within a few months artemis
is preparing machines great magnitude for
the attack the city he teaches me that the
samianss are brave and wealthy and that no
city is capable such a resistance certainly
never were such preparations i hope at least
that the report them will detain your enemies
at home and at all events that before they
land you will leave miletus and come to me
the war is very popular at athens i dare say
it is equally so at samos equally so at
miletus nothing pleases men like renewing
their ancient alliance with the brutes and
breaking off the more recent one with their
fellow creatures
 pericles and aspasia
war is it o grave heads that ye
with stern and stately pomp decree 
inviting all the gods from far
to join you in the game war 
have ye then lived so many years
to find no purer joy than tears
and seek ye now the highest good
in strife in anguish and in blood 
your wisdom may be more than ours
but you have spent your golden hours
and have methinks but little right
to make the happier fret and fight
ah when will come the calmer day
when these dark clouds shall pass away 
when should two cities disagree
the young the beauteous and the free
rushing with all their force shall meet
and struggle with embraces sweet
til they who may have suffered most
give in and own the battle lost
philosophy does not always play fair with us
she often eludes us when she has invited us
pericles and aspasia 
and leaves us when she has led us the farthest
way from home perhaps it is because we have
jumped up from our seats at the first lesson she
would give us and the easiest and the best
there are few words in the precept
give pleasure receive it 
avoid giving pain avoid receiving it
for the duller scholar who may find it difficult
to learn the whole she cuts each line in the
middle and tells him kindly that it will serve
the purpose if he will but keep it in his
memory
cleone to aspasia
will you never be serious even upon the
most serious occasions there are so many
grecian states on both continents and in the
islands that surely some could always be found
 pericles and aspasia
both willing and proper to arbitrate on any
dissension if litigations are decided by arbiters
when two men contend as they often are
surely it would be an easier matter with cities
and communities for they are not liable to the
irritation arising from violent words nor to the
hatred that springs up afresh between two men
who strive for property every time they come
within sight i believe the greeks are the
happiest people upon earth or that ever are
likely to exist upon it and chiefly from their
separation into small communities independent
governments and laws made by the people for
the people but unless they come to the determination
that no war whatever shall be undertaken
until the causes quarrel are examined
and the conditions accommodation
both proposed and enforced by others from
whom impartiality is most reasonably to be expected
they will exist without enjoying the
pericles and aspasia 
greatest advantage that the gods have offered
them religious men i foresee vtill be sorry
to displease the god battles let him have
all the kingdoms the world to himself but i
wish he would resign to the quieter deities our
little greece
preparations are going on here for resistance
to the samianss and we hear that athenian ships
are cruising off their island
in case necessity every thing is ready for
my departure to the sources the meander
i will prove to you that i am not hurried nor
frightened i have leisure to write out what
perhaps may be the very last verses written in
miletus unless we are relieved

herodotus on returning from his victory at
the olympian games was the guest pericles
you saw him afterwards and he might have
told you that pericles was urgent with him to
remain at athens true as a stranger he
would have been without influence here in political
affairs it is evident that he desires no
such thing but prefers as literary men should
always do tranquility and retirement these he
may enjoy in perfection where he is and write
the truth intrepidly pericles has more than
once heard from him life passes in no part
 the world so easily and placidly as among the
grecian colonies in italy they rarely quarrel
pericles and aspasia 
they have room enough men enough wealth
enough and not too much one petty tyrant
has sprung up amongst them lately and has
imprisoned exiled and murdered the best
citizens
pericles was asked his advice what should be
done with him he answered
i never interfere in the affairs others
it appears to me that where you have nothing
but a weasel to hunt you should not bring
many dogs into the field nor great ones butin
fact the ratcatcher is the best counsellor on
these occasions he neither makes waste nor
noise
the tyrant we hear is sickening and many
epitaphs are already composed for him the
shortest is
the pigmy despot matins lies here 
he was not godless no his god was fear
herodotus tells that throughout the lower
 pericles and aspasia
italy poverty is unknown every town well
governed every field well ploughed every
meadow well irrigated every vineyard pruned
scientifically the people choose their higher
magistrates from the most intelligent provided
they are not needy the only offices that are
salaried are the lower which all the citizens
have an equal chance attaining some by
lot some by suffrage this is the secret why
the governments are peaceful and durable no
rich man can become the richer for them every
poor man may but honestly and carefully
cleone to aspasia
corinna was honored in her native place as
greatly as abroad this is the privilege our
sex pindar and eschylus left their country
pericles and aspasia 
not because the lower orders were indifferent
or unjust to them but because those who were
born their equals could not endure to see them
rise their superiors
what a war against the gods is this 
it seems as if it were decreed by a publick
edict that no one shall receive from them any
gift above a certain value and that if they
do receive it they shall be permitted to return
the gods no thanks for it in their native city
so then republicks must produce genius
and kings reward it 
so then hiero and archelaiis must be elevated
to the rank cimon and pericles o
shame o ignominy 
what afflicts me deeply is the intelligence we
receive that herodotus has left ionia he was
crowned at the olympian games he was invited
to a publick festival in every city he visited
throughout the whole extent greece even
 pericles and aspasia
his own was pleased with him yet he too has
departed not to archelaiis or to hiero but to
the retirement and tranquility italy
i do believe aspasia that studious men who
look so quiet are the most restless men in existence

oration pericles to the soldiers
round samos
little time is now left us o athenians between
the consideration and the accomplishment
 our duties the justice the cause
when it was first submitted to your decision in
the agora was acknowledged with acclamations
the success it you have ensured by
your irresistible energy the port samos is
in our possession and we have occupied all the
eminences round her walls patience is now as
pericles and aspasia 
requisite to us as to the enemy for although
every city which can be surrounded can be
captured yet in some where courage and numbers
have been insufficient to drive oif the besieger
nature and art may have thrown up
obstacles to impede his progress such is
samos the strongest fortress in europe excepting
only byzantion but byzantion fell
before our fathers and unless she become less
deaf to the reclamations honour less indifferent
to the sanctitude treaties unless she
prefer her fellowsoldiers to her common enemy
freedom to aristocracy friends to strangers
greeks to asiatics she shall abase her thracian
fierceness before us however we will
neither spurn the suppliant nor punish the repentant
 our arms we will turn for ever as we
turn them now against the malicious rival the
alienated relative the apostate confederate and
the proud oppressor where a sense dignity
 pericles and aspasia
is faint and feeble and where reason hath lain
unexercised and inert many nations have occasionally
been happy and even flourishing under
kings but oligarchy hath ever been a curse to
all from its commencement to its close to
remove it eternally from the vicinity miletus
and from the welldisposed that very city by
which hostilities are denounced against her is
at once our interest and our duty for oligarchy
in every part the world are necessarily
our enemies since we have always shown our
fixt determination to aid and support with all
our strength the defenders civility and freedom
it is not in our power for against our
institutions and consciences we athenians can
do nothing it is not in our power i repeat it
to sit idly by while those who were our fellowcombatants
against the persian and who suffered
from his aggression even more than we
did are assailed by degenerate loans whose
pericles and aspasia 
usurpation rests on persia we have enemies
wherever there is injustice done to greeks 
and we will abolish that injustice and we will
quell those enemies wherever there are equal
laws we have friends and those friends we will
succour and those laws we will maintain on
which side do the considerate and religious look
forward to the countenance the gods often
have they deferred indeed their righteous judgments
but never have they deserted the longsuffering
and the brave upon the ground
where we were standing when you last heard
my appeal to you were not xerxes and his
naiads encamped what drove them from it 
the wisdom force and fortitude breathed into
your hearts by the immortal gods preserve
them with equal constancy and your return i
promise you shall not have been more glorious
from salamis than from samos
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
samos has fallen pericles will have given
you this information long before my letter can
reach you and perhaps the joy the lighthearted
athenians will be over ere then so
soon dies away the satisfaction great exploits
even such as have swept a generation from
before us have changed the fortunes a thousand
more and indeed have shaken the last link
in the remotest we hear but perhaps the
estimate is exaggerated that the walls miletus
 ephesus priene are in comparison
to samos as the fences a farmyard are to
them certain it is that the vanquished fleet
was more formidable than the united navies
 corinth and carthage which are rated ag
next in force to the athenian
by this conquest we are delivered from impericles
and a spa si a 
minent danger yet i am ashamed to say it
our citizens are ungrateful already it is by
the exertions the athenians that they are
not slaves and they reason as basely as if they
were they pretend to say that it was jealousy
 samos and the sudden and vast increase 
her maritime power but by no means any affection
for miletus which induced them to take
up arms athens had just reason for hostility 
why should she urge in preference unjust ones 
alas if equity is supported by violence little
can be the wonderment if power be preceded by
falsehood such a reflection may be womanish
but are not all peculiarly so which are quiet
compassionate and consistent the manly
mind in its continual course impediments
and cataracts receives and gives few true
images our stagnant life in this respect has
greatly the advantage
xanthus the friend you remember poor
vol i n
 pericles and aspasia
xeniades fought as a volunteer in the athenian
army and was entrusted with the despatches
to our government
xanthus i said the general your countrymen
will hereafter read your name although
it is not written here for we conquerors 
samos are no little jealous one another go
and congratulate the milesian they will understand
us both
i asked him many questions he replied
with much simplicity i was always too much
in it to know any thing about it the principal
thing i remember is that pericles i was
told smiled at me for a moment in the heat
 battle and went on to another detachment

pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
the wind i understand has delayed my last
letter in harbour and continues adverse everyday
we receive some fresh vessel from samos
and some new intelligence true is it we discover
that the prevailing party had been supported
at once by the peloponnesian and the
persians the chastisement the delinquents
is represented as very much too mild they
would have made us slaves let us make them
so such with scourges and tortures were
the denunciations the people and the soldiery
 and more vehemently in samos than in
miletus the leaders the oligarchy now
supprest for ever were two men low extraction
lysimachus and elpenor we daily
hear some story well known in samos only
 these incendiaries lysimachus was 

 pericles and aspasia
riches by the collocation his wife with an old
dotard worn out by gluttony and disordered
in intellect by his last testament made when
he had lost his senses he bequeathed her fifty
talents the heirs refused to pay them and
lysimachus would have pleaded her cause before
the people had they not driven him away
with shouts and stones nevertheless he was
thought a worthy champion the faction and
the rather as his hatred his fellowcitizens
and former companions must be sincere and inextinguishable
elpenor is far advanced in age
his elder son was wounded by accident and
died within the walls avarice and parsimony
had always been his characteristicks under the
veil however morality and religion the
speech he made at the funeral is thus reported
it hath been o men samos the decree
 the immortal gods whose names be ever
blessed 
pericles and aspasia 
hold hard there cannot you see that there
are no more sparks in the pyre the wine
smells sadly throw no more on them take
it home to the cellar to remove from
my aged eyes from my frail embraces the delight
 my life the stair my declining years
all spent in the service my beloved country
it is true i have another son rising out his
adolescence here beside me o my child 
molismogis molismogis on such a melancholy
occasion dost thou alas tie indissolubly
and wastefully that beautiful piece packthread
 hard knots hard knots hard fate 
hard fate thy poor bereaved mother may
want it and it will fail her in the hour 
need
two torches were borne before the funeral
one them presently gave signs rather prematurely
emblematical our mortal state and
could be restored to its functions by no exertion
 pericles and aspasia
 the bearer first waving it gently toward its
companion then shaking it with all his might
horizontally vertically diagonally then holding
it down despondently to the earth elpenor
beckoned to him and asked him in his ear how
much he had paid for it
haifa drachma
fraud i cried elpenor fraud even at
the tomb before the dead and before the gods
 the dead from whom did you make the
purchase 
from gylippides son oracles
tell gylippides son oracles calmly
said elpenor that in my love equity in
my duty to the state in my piety to the gods
in my pure desire to preserve the tranquility
 his conscience i cite him before the tribunal
unless he refund an obol then
aloud it was not in this manner o athenians
 that our forefathers reverenced the dead
pericles and aspasia 
he gave way under his grief and was carried
back with little commiseration elpenor is
among the richest men in greece unless the
conquerors have curtailed his treasures it is
but reasonable that every thing such men possess
should compensate the people for years 
rapine disunion and turbulence for the evil
laws they enacted and for the better they misadministered
and perverted
aspasia to cleone
enough enough is it for me to see my pericles
safe at home again not a word has he
spoken not a question have i asked him about
the odious war samos he made in samos i
hear a most impressive oration to celebrate
the obsequies those brave soldiers who fell
 pericles and aspasia
in athens there all is exultation he has rendered
the slain the most glorious the triumphant
and the fatherless the proudest the
living but at last how little worth is the
praise eloquence elpenor and lysimachus
lead councils and nations great gods surely
ye must pity us when we worship you we
who obey and appear to reverence the vilest 
our species i recover my step i will not again
slip into this offal come and away to xanthus
ay ay cleon simplicity bravery wellmerited
and wellborne distinction take
him take him we must not all be cruel to
ourselves
cleone to aspasia
aspasia you mistake grant me the presence
 friendship and the memory love it
pericles and aspasia 
is only in this condition that a woman can be
secure from fears and other weaknesses i may
admire xanthus and there is pleasure in admiration
if thought i could love him i
should begin to distrust and despise myself i
would not desecrate my heart even were it in
ruins but i am happy very happy not indeed
altogether as i was in early youth perhaps it
was youth itself that occasioned it let me
think so indulge me in the silence and solitude
 this one fancy if there was any thing
else how sacred should it ever be to me ah
yes there was and sacred it is and shall be

parties pleasure are setting sail every day
almost for samos we begin to be very brave 
we women i mean i suspect that no few 
us take an unworthy delight in the humiliation
and misery the fair samianss not having
seen nor intending to see them mysek i can
only tell you what i have heard their calamities

loud outcries were raised by the popular
orators against such them as were suspected
 favoring the persian faction and it was demanded
 the judges that they should be deported
and exposed for slaves this menace
you may well imagine caused great anxiety and
alarm even among those who appeared to be
quite resigned to such a destiny while the gallant
young athenians were around the walls
pericles and aspasia 
but to be sold and the gods alone know
to whom old morose men perhaps and
jealous women we suspect it was at the instigation
 pericles that a much severer chastisement
has befallen them they have been
condemned to wear the habiliments persians
surely no refinement cruelty can surpass the
decree by which a greek woman is divested 
that beautiful dress which alone can be called
an ornament to the female form this decree
has been carried into execution and you would
pity even the betrayers their country whether
in ignorance what the persian habit is
or from spite and malice the samian ladies are
obliged to wear sleeves sufficient amplitude
to conceal a traitor in each and chains intersecting
the forehead with their links and ornaments
and hair not divided along the whole
summit the head but turned back about the
centre to make them resemble the heads 
 pericles and aspasia
some poisonous snakes this barbarian garb has
already had such an effect on many that they
have cast themselves into the sea and others
have entreated that they may as was first
threatened rather be sold for slaves
cleone to aspasia
odious as undoubtedly was the conduct 
the samian oligarchy and priesthood and liable
as are all excesses to a still farther exaggeration
in the statement them you will hardly believe
the effrontery the successful demagogues
not contented with undeniable proofs in regard
to the enormous and mismanaged wealth torn
away from the priests bacchus they have invented
the most improbable falsehood that the
malevolence faction ever cast against the in
pericles and aspasia 
silence power they pretend that certain
men some ancient family more recent had
conspired to transmit the reins government
to their elder sons possession for life is not
long enough they are not only to pass laws
but whenever it so pleases to impede them 
they decree that the firstborn male is to be the
wisest and best the family and shall legislate
for all samos democracy has just to go one
step farther and to persuade the people ready
at such times to believe anything that the oligarchy
had resolved to render their power hereditary
not only for one generation but for seven
the nation so long abused in its understanding
would listen to and believe the report ignorant
that arbitrary power has never been carried to
such extravagance even in persia itself although
it is reported that in india the lower orders 
people were hereditarily subject to the domination
 a privileged class but this may be
 pericles and aspasia
false and indeed it must be if what is likewise
told us concerning them be true which is
that they have letters among them
aspasia to cleone
you have given me in your two last letters
a great deal curious information about the
discoveries that the demagogues made or pretended
to have made in samos it is credible
enough that the oligarchy were desirous transmitting
their authority to their children but
that they believed so implicitly in the infatuation
 the citizens or the immutability human
events as to expect a continuation power in
the same families for seven generations is too
gross and absurd even to mislead an insurgent
and infuriated populace he indeed must be
composed mud from the nile who can endure
pericles and aspasia 
with patience this rancorous fabrication in
egypt we are told by herodotus in his erato
that the son a herald is course a herald 
and if any man hath a louder voice than he it
goes for nothing
hereditary heralds are the proper officers 
hereditary lawgivers and both are well worthy
 dignity where the deities are cats
strange oversight that no provision should
ever have been devised to ensure in these tutelar
and truly household gods an equal security for
lineal succession 
aspasia to cleone
abuses many kinds and great enormity
have been detected by the samianss in their
overthrown government what exasperates the
people most and indeed the most justly is the
 pericles and aspasia
discovery that the ruling familles have grossly
abused the temples to the high displeasure 
the gods sacrilege has been carried to such
a pitch that some among them have appointed
a relative or dependent to the service more
than one sanctuary you remember that anciently
all the worship this island was confined
to juno she displeased the people i
know not upon what occasion and they suffered
the greater part her fanes to fall in ruins
and transferred the richest the remainder to
the priests bacchus several those who
had bent the knee before juno took up the
thyrsus with the same devotion the people
did indeed hope that the poor and needy and
particularly such as had lost their limbs in war
or their parents or their children by shipwreck
would be succoured out the wealth arising
from the domains the priesthood and the
rather as these domains were bequeathed by
pericles and aspasia 
religious men whose whole soul rested upon
juno and whose bequest was now utterly frustrated
by taking them from the sister jupiter
and giving them exclusively to his son beside
it was recollected by the elderly that out 
these vast possessions aid was afforded to the
state when the state required it and that
wherever there stood one these temples
hunger and sickness sorrow and despair were
comforted and assuaged the people it appears
derived no advantages from the change
and only grew more dissatisfied and violent
for if those who had officiated in the temples 
juno were a little more licentious than became
the ministers a goddess they did not run
into the streets and through the country places
drunk and armed nor did they seize upon the
grapes because they belonged to bacchus 
nor upon the corn because it is unwholesome
to drink wine without bread nor upon the
 pericles and aspasia
cattle because man cannot live on bread alone
these arguments you may suspect insufficiency
 what then will you think when you hear
another reason theirs which is that the
nation has no right to take from hem what
belongs to the goddess the people cry
how then can it belong to you pushed upon
this side they argue that they cannot be deprived
 their salaries because they are from
land what reply the citizens are not gold
and silver the products land also but
long possession we will remedy that too as
well as we can the soldiers and sailors have
the most reason to complain when they see
twelve priests in the enjoyment more salary
than seven thousand the bravest combatants
the military are disbanded and deprived 
pay at the instant when their services are no
longer necessary yet no part it appears a
superfluous and idle priesthood is to be reduced
pericles and aspasia 
or regulated on the contrary it is rapacious
and irreligious to take away three temples from
a venerable occupant four was ever soldier
so impudent as to complain that rations were
not allowed him in four detachments his
army the downfall the old faction will be
 little benefit to samos while these insults
and iniquities press upon the people unless
those who are now entrusted with power resolve
to abolish the gross abuses the priesthood
the wealth which is greater and worse
applied in samos than it is even in those
countries where the priests are soprano and
venerated as deities little imports it by whom
they are governed or what gods they venerate
it is better to be ruled by the kings lacedaemon
and wiser to salute in worship the sun
 persia never surely will the island be pacified
until what was taken from juno shall
also be taken from bacchus and until the
 pericles and aspasia
richest priest be reduced in his emoluments far
below the level a polemarch
aspasia to cleone
those your letters my cleon which relate
to the affairs samos and especially to the
priests juno and bacchus have led me into
many reflections the people athens are
the most religious any upon earth but i
doubt whether they are the most just the most
generous the most kindly there is not a
friend whatever benefit they may have received
from him whom they would not abandon or
denounce on a suspicion irreverence to pallas
 and those in general are the most fanatical
and furious whom as goddess wisdom she
has least favored your neighbours the sapericles
and aspasia 
means are more judicious in their worship 
juno they know that as long as jupiter hath
a morsel ambrosia she will share it although
he may now and then indulge in a draught 
nectar to which her lips have no access tie
samianss have discovered that wealth is not a
requisite worship and that a temple needs
not a thousand para sangs land for its inclosure
if we believed that gods could be jealous
we might fear that there would be much ill
blood between juno and bacchus it is more
probable that they will look on calmly and let
their priests fight it out the persians in
these matters are not quite so silly as we are
herodotus tells us that instead altars and
temples the verdure the earth is chosen for
their sacrifice and musick and garlands prayers
and thanksgivings are thought as decent and
acceptable as comminations and blood it does
not appear that they are less moral or less re
 pericles and aspasia
religious than those who have twenty gods and
twenty temples for each the wiser men in
athens tell us that the vulgar have their prejudices
where indeed is the person who never
has repeated this observation yet believe me
cleon it is utterly untrue the vulgar have
not their prejudices they have the prejudices
 those who ought to remove them if they had
any interested men give them not their religion
but clubs and daggers for enforcing it
taking from them in return their time their
labour their benevolence their understanding
and their wealth and are such persons to be
invested with the authority lawgivers and the
splendour satraps the samianss have decided
that question priests bacchus let
them diffuse the liberality and joyousness and
curtail a little from the swaggering stateliness 
him whom the poet calls in his dithyrambic
she tigerhome and mortaumothered god
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
hephaestion whom i never have mentioned
to you and whom indeed i hardly know byname
is going to italy and has written this
poem on the eve his departure it is said
that his verses are deficient in tenderness and
amenity certain it is that he by no means
indulges in the display them whatever they
may be when pericles had read the following
i asked him what he thought the author
i think replied pericles that he will never
attempt to deprive me my popularity
i am afraid he is an illtempered man yet l
hear he has suffered on many occasions and
particularly in regard to his fortune very great
injustice with equally great unconcern he is
never seen in the agora nor in the theatre nor
in the temples nor in any assemblage the
 pericles and aspasia
people nor in any society the learned nor
has he taken the trouble to enter into a confederacy
or strike a bargain as warier men do
with any praiser no not even for the loan 
a pair palms in the keramicos
i have now said all i believe you will think it
requisite for me to say on a citizen so obscure
and so indifferent a poet yet even he poor
man imagines that his effusions must endure
this is the most poetical thought i can find in
him but perhaps he may have written what is
better than my specimen
the lambicks hephstion
speak not too ill me athenian friends 
nor ye athenian sages speak too ill 
from others all tribes am i secure
 leave your confines none whom you caress
finding me hungry and athirst shall dip
into ephesus the grey bowl to quench
pericles and aspasia 
my thirst or break the horny bread and scoop
stiffly around the scanty vase wherewith
to gather the hard honey at the sides
and give it me for having heard me sing
sages and friends a better cause remains
for wishing no black sail upon my mast
tis friends and sages lest when other men
say words a little gentler ye repent
yet be forbidden by stern pride to share
the golden cup kindness pushing back
your seats and gasping for a draught scorn
alas shall this too never lack before
be when you most would crave it out reach 
thus on the plank now neptune is invoked
i warn you your peril i must live
and ye o friends howe'er unwilling may
cleone to aspasia
aspasia i have many things to say in reply
to your last letter
vol i o
 pericles and aspasia
believe me i can take little interest in any
illtempered man hephaestion is this you tell
me and there is nothing in his lamhicks to
make me doubt it neither do they contain
you justly remark any thing so characteristick
 a poet as the confidence he expresses that he
shall live all poets good and bad are possessed
by this confidence because the minds
 them all however feeble however capacious
are carried to the uttermost pitch 
enthusiasm in this dream they fancy they
stand upon the same eminence or nearly so
and look unto the same distance but no poet
or other writer supposing him in his senses
could ever think seriously that his works will
be eternal for whatever had a beginning must
also have an and in this predicament are
languages like the fowls the air they are
driven from the plains and take refuge in the
mountains until at last they disappear leaving
pericles and aspasia 
some few traces some sounds imperfectly
caught up highly poetical works or those in
which eloquence is invested with the richest
attributes poetry are the only ones that can
prolong the existence a dialect egypt and
phoenicia and chaldea beyond doubt contain
many treatises on the arts and sciences although
unpublished and preserved only by the priesthood
or by the descendants the authors and
discoverers these are certainly to pass away
before inventions and improvements more important
but if there is any thing genius in
their hymns fables or histories it will remain
among them even when their languages shall
have undergone many variations and afterwards
when they are spoken no longer it
will be incorporated with others and finally be
claimed as original and indigenous by nations
the most remote and dissimilar many streams
whose fountains are now utterly dried up have
 pericles and aspasia
flowed from afar to be lost in the ocean 
homer our early companions the animals 
good old esp have spoken successively in
every learned tongue and now a few words on
that gentlest and most fatherly masters
before we teach his fables to children we
should study them very attentively ourselves
they were written for the wisest and the most
powerful whose wisdom they might increase
and whose power they might direct there are
many men influence and authority apt enough
to take kindly a somewhat sharp bite from a dog
or monkey and to be indignant at the slightest
touch on the shoulder from a fellowcreature
it is improbable that a fable will do many 
them much good but it may do a little to one
in twenty and the amount is by no means unimportant
in that number generations the
only use esp to children after the delight
he gives them is the promotion familiarity
pericles and aspasia 
and friendship with animals in proportion as
they appear to deserve it and a great use indeed
it is if i were not afraid that one or
other these vigilant creatures might snap at
me i would now begin to quarrel a little with
you and yet i think i should have on my
side some the more sagacious were i to reprehend
you for letting an illtempered man
render you supercilious and unjust how do
you know pray that hephsestion may not live 
and quite as long as he fancies he shall a century
or two or three even in the iambics
there is a compression and energy thought
which the best poets sometimes want and there
is in them as much poetry as was necessary on
the occasion the poet has given us at one
stroke the true impression a feature in his
character which few have done and few can
do excepting those only which are nearly alike
in the whole fraternity
o 
 pericles and aspasia
doubtless we are pleased to take our daily
walk by streams that reflect the verdure and the
flowers but the waters a gloomy cavern maybe
as pellucid and pure and more congenial to
our graver thoughts and bolder imaginations
for any high or any wide operation a poet
must be endued not with passion indeed but
with power and mastery over it with imagination
with reflection with observation and with
discernment there are however some things
in poetry which admit few these qualities
comedy for instance would evaporate under
too fervid a fancy and the sounds the ode
would be dulled and deadened by being too
closely overarched with the fruitage reflection
homer in himself is subject to none the
passions but he sends them all forth on his
errands with as much precision and velocity as
apollo his golden arrows the hostile gods
the very fates themselves must have wept with
pericles and aspasia 
priam in the tent before achilles homer
stands unmoved
aspasia there is every reason why a goodnatured
person should make us goodnatured
but none whatever why an illnatured one
should make us illnatured neither them
ought to make us unjust you do not know
hephaestion and you speak ill him on the
report others who perhaps know him as little
as you do you would shudder if i ventured to
show you the position you have taken illtempered
you cannot be you would not be unfair
 what if in the opinion all your friends
you should be a more shocking thing than
either what in the name the immortal
gods if i should have found you on this one
occasion a somnambulist on the verge vulgarity

take courage nobody has seen it but myself
if there are bad people in the world
 pericles and aspasia
and maybe there are plenty we ought never tolet
it be thought that we are near enough to be
aware it
again to hephsestion
it is better to be austere than ambitious
better to live out society than to court the
worst how many the powerful even within
the confines their own household will be remembered
less affectionately and lastingly than
tame sparrows and talking days and among
the number those who are destined to be
known hereafter how many will the
memory be laden with contempt or with execrations
 to the wealthy proud and arrogant
the gods have allotted no longer an existence
than to the utensils in their kitchens or
the vermin in their sewers while to those
whom such perishable would depress and vilify
the same eternal beings have decreed and
ratified their own calm consciousness plastic
pericles and aspasia 
power immovable superiority with a portion
immeasurably great their wisdom their
authority and their duration
cleone to aspasia
we have kept your birthday aspasia 
on these occasions i am reluctant to write
any thing politeness i think and humanity
should always check the precipitancy congratulation
nobody is felicitated on losing even
the loss a bracelet or tiara is deemed no subject
for merriment and alertness in our friends
and followers surely then the marked and
registered loss an irreparable year the loss 
a limb life ought to excite far other sensations

so long is it o aspasia since we had read
any poetry together i am quite uncertain whether
you know the ode to asteroessa
 pericles and aspasia

asteroessa many bring
the vows verse and blooms spring
to crown thy natal day
lop my vow too amid the rest 
 ne'er mayst thou sigh from that white breast
o take them all away i

for there are cares and there are wrongs
and withering eyes and venom'd tongues 
they now are far behind 
but come they must and every year
some flowers decay some thorns appear
whereof these gifts remind

cease raven cease nor scare the dove
with croak around and swoop above 
be peace be joy within 
 all that hail this happy tide
my verse alone be cast aside 
lyre cymbal dance begin 
pericles and aspasia 
although there must be some myriads odes
written on the same occasion yet among the
hundred or two on which i can lay my hand

rather live back the past

in the meantime bishop finlay who had
fled with the lord james tocarrickfergus in
ireland having been seized with a sore malady
departed this life and the young lord
had after his obsequies passed over the seato
the cflle the macdonald in skye to
seek the aid his help and means against
their common enemy the king for so they
both wrathfully accounted his majesty
the lord james because the dreadful devastation
which his austere justice had brought
upon hisfathers house and macdonald not
only as an adherent the faction the alvol
 a
 the spaewife
bailies but for the prejudice which his daughter
the lady sibilla had suffered in the
frustration her betrothinent
the lord james on reaching the shores 
skye was informed by certain persons who
had come from the mainland that macdonald
was then tit inverlochy with his kith kin
and allies having retiuned thither from an
expedition which he had taken to avenge the
fate his old friend duke murdoch in
which inroad finding himself none succoured
by those on whose swords he had reckoned
for they were the party for whom sir robert
gramme had so unprofitably made himself
spokesman he was fain to progress contrition
to the king for his rashness in order
that he might be clement permitted as he in
the was to return faithless home
on hearing these tidings the lord james
forthwith ordered the bark wherein he had
come from ireland to make for invlochy
where he was welcomed by the macdonald as
the spaewife s
if the rites and benediction holy church had
made him indeed his soninlaw nor was it
long till uiey had concerted a new enterprise
to the which the lord the isles was the
more easily incited by the assurances which
hje received from his guest that the mutations
 fortune had none changed the sincerity 
the love and devotion which he had professed
for the lady sibilla
could we said the lord james but
drive this tyrant king back to england i
doubt not the estates the realm would
speedily reverse my attainder and restore me
to the rights and rank my family then
should i prove before the world with what
unimpaired affection i am in heart wedded to
sibilla or if we meet in battle and he be
slain or taken shall i not be king and sibilla
share with me the dignity royal 
these sanguine anticipations youthful
adventure together with his own sense 
baffled enterprise and the native turbulence
 the spaewife
 his temper so worked upon macdonald
that next morning he marched with his clansmen
accompanied by the lord james for
inverness where no later than the third day
after having received the king's clement permission
to return home unmolested he arrived
and where to shew how resolute he was
to set at nought the royal authority the first
thing he did was to burn the town and lay
siege to the castle
now it had so chanced that the lady sibill
by the exhortations her aunt the
discreet countess boss with the artery
solicitations her royal mistress about this
time came back to the court and was then
abiding with the queen in the abbey 
holyrood at edinburgh where in the judgment
 all the gallants her beauty albeit
faded in its virgin bloom had received new
lustre by the virtue her endeavouring to
avert the doom the illfated princes to
no eye did it shine so bright and fair as to
the spaewife 
that stuart who was become her openly
professed lover seconded in his suit by the
gentle recommendations both the king and
queen and by many a laudatory advertisement
 his worth and knighthood from the
countess boss who was won to favour
him by the courtesies which he administered
as it were with the left hand to the weak side
 her vanities
sibilla however heeded not the fond admiration
with which she was followed but
abandoned herself to bitter ruminations on
the disappointment her early affection and
the ruined fortunes her first lover for
though she shunned not the pastimes the
court yet was her spirit amidst the most joyful
revels ever far away and her eyes wandered
with a cold and aimless restlessness
that often touched the observer with the sympathy
 a melancholy wonder and sorrow
she had plainly no pleasure in any kind 
companionship but as often as she could
 the spaewife
pass forth unheeded she chose her solitary
walks among the lonely places the neighbouring
mountain sitting sometimes on the
perilous brink the precipices like the white
seabird that perches on the ocean cliffs at
others hovering in the still the evening
twilight amidst the shadows and lowering
rocks that overhang the chapel st anthony
came to pass one morning as she went
forth from the abbey to indulge her moium
ful cogitations in that manner in the kings
park that she saw anniple dunblane
standing at a little distance on the greensward
resting her hands on the top the
rough sapling which though a burden she
had long used as a staff she was leaning
forward and her eyes were cast down earnestly
concerning with something that she
contemplated cm the ground
 gxod morrow anniple said the pale
and pensive sibilla what seest thou on the
grass to make thee read it so earnestly 
the spaewife 
the spaewife without raining her eyes
gave a quick and impatient intimation with
her hand that she did not wish to be disturbed

 i would give a mere for thy fancies
said the lady
anniple without making any reply or
changing her position hell out her hand to
accept the gift
 nay that may not be no work no wage
annipleend if you will not tell me i shall
at once say again good morrow 
the fantastical creature still made no reply 
but looking up she beckoned with her finger
to the lady sibilla to draw near she then
pointed to the ground and said
 see ye that lady sibilla see ye that
there
 i see nothing anniple but a beetle
crawling
 it's a clokkddy in her scarlet cardinal
 what im 
 the spaewife
 ist no a sinful injustice sibilla macdonald
that the hand o heaven should have
tarn such pains to mak and adorn that loathsome
thing and let the fairies make the like
 me out o a benweed that the very kine
have more sense than to taste 
all things replied sibilla are by
permission heaven and done in wisdom
and with justice
anniple eyed her askance with a bright
and piercing look and then said in a sharp
and sarcastic accent 
wha did the wrang that ye yearn to revenge
and gave leave for the duke that ye
dree and she added laughingly and
so ye thought i was marvelling at the red
mantle o the leddylaunners but grubs
and worms are nae marvels to me ever since
i sleep the night the four burials in the
old leddy o pinkerton's coibsn in campus
kirkyard she was buried wi her
weddingring and the ethereal howkit her up
the paewife 
to take it off i saw frae hint a headstone
what the loon was doing and when he was
whiting wi her finger i gaed such a strike
like a howlit that it gar him take legbail
see there's the ring on my ain midfinger wi
a garnet stane like a blob o blood when the
bethel ran away i herryt the corpse niyse
and hart it out by the leg and the windingsheet
and lay cosily down in the coffin till the
momingh what a fright i trow father
andrews got when he saw me sleeping
there and the poor auld leddy o pinkerton
lying in her deadclass on the grass but i
wish near to dream as i did that night for
i dreamt i was dead and buried in a tomb 
and that cloaks and worms were crawling and
adding o'er m heart and neath my backand
a black toad she sat on machin
watching my mouth that he might loup in
sibilla shuddered and moved to go away 
but anniple took hold her mantle and said

but i have na told you what i was looking
at

apprehensive some still more hideous rehearsal

i saw lord athos replied anniple
 as i came through the park yestreen m
this spot and just now when i was coming by
again i had a glimmering glimpse his likeness
on the grass with the look one thai
would do ill yet was afraid i hae a thought
he would fain be king
you speak maliciously anniple said
sibilla at once surprised and struck with the
remark go to else you may have cause
to repent such slander the earl athos
is an honest man albeit no friend nor favourite
with me
 when the king dies he'll be crowned fora
that
 duke murdoch's son the lord james
though under the ban outlawry and forfeited

tare is nearer to the thrones replied sibilla
seriously forgetting in the emotion the

doom and til say no more but what need
i care aae good will come o't to me i
would i could forget the looks o him as i
saw him here maybe it was the deil in his

macdonald that i never forgather with
lord athos himself but some duke or damage
ever befalls me i wish ye would put
your hand to the work and help to shove him
out o the world sand ye should too for he's
a cross in your own fortunes

chap iii
when the king saw that the lady sibilla
desired to avoid his presence he abated his
speed and walked leisurely towards stuart
who at the same time advanced to meet
hint
 i should said his majesty it a grave
but jocular manner have laid my interdict
at this time on our fair and eloquent cousin 
for i doubt not that if she is permitted to beat
large among our friends she will achieve
as good as a victory for her father before we
march but stuart as i doubt not some
such event was the endeavour her discourse
with you i shall not repine if on conditions
you submit to abide her prisoner
 i have now no hope replied stuart
that she will ever consent to be mine
the paewife s
how said the king what new
thing has come to pass to make you think

it is not in my power to show by any
act or deed that my proffered affection is 
that purity which the cruelty ladies in these
times requires to be avouched by proof and
sacrifice the time was as i have heard say
that ladies were to be won by the gentle sympathy
 heavennspired love but the lady
sibilla would inflict tests
let her have none cousin replied the
king for if she be such a bargainer beshrew
me if she is worth the having but truly 
late she hath been an altered creature in her
demeanour and no more like the gay and
blooming rose she once was than the root is like
the flower and his majesty added with a
slight inflection sadness in his voice 
plied the ein as if he ponderedijwhimi
the spaewife 
self i alone have a right to your service
sand if it stand with my pleasure and convenience
to say you shall abide here i see
not what cause ether honour knighthood
propinquity or loyalty have to remonstrate
against your obedience to the commands
 it is rumoured that the lord james 
albany is with macdonald said stuart
what then what that i should
think it a reason why you ought the more to
remain with sibiua as her affection for him is
the greatest impediment to your suit
i doubts replied stuart if it is so
much her affection as her ambition and it is
that which makes me despair ever succeeding
but just now she plainly told me that she
considered him dearer than ever since by the
fate his father and brothers he stood so
much nearer to the crown
 can she be so sordid exclaimed the
king then is there no faithful love in womankind
 for all ladies i have ever seen
 the spaewife
i did think sibilla macdonald the most romantic
in her attachment besides his sentence
 outlawry and forfeiture has cut him
off from the succession but how is it that
all you seem so to count upon an early death
for me is not our turbulent cousin my
senior and surely am not so much older
than yourself stuart that yoii should be
reckoned my successor to say nothing the
present maternal condition the queen
r his majesty said this in a sharp objurgatory
manner then speedily recovering his wonted
urbanity he added but after all stuart
not to make too much ado about who shall
have his head bound with a wreath briers
as this very conversation ours sufficiently
shows the crown to be i think you ought to
remain if love be not the entire sentiment
that binds sibilla to the outlaw we can hardly
question that ambition is not the sole motive
which makes her father espouse his fortunes
and therefore were you to remain
the spaewif 
behind upon the pretext and plea your
devotichi to sibilla perhaps out the policy
 that device some way might be found so
to work on the avarice macdonald as to
make him abandon our guilty cousin to his
own destiny without therefore entering
more curiously into your particular case i
lay my commands upon you to abide herewith
the queen and her ladies and it shall be
made known that i have done so because 
your love and devotion for the daughter 
the rebellious chieftain things as familiar as
scandal to every tongue in the court
stuart would have a second time solicited
his majesty not so to restrain him from taking
the field albeit in his heart none dissatisfied
that he had been so peremptory but
the king said with a smile honour knighthood
propinquity and loyalty must now
hush their remonstrances and prove themselves
the soldiers and vassals obedience
your post and duty in the war is here in
 the paewife
holyroodhouse and with these words he
parted from him leaving him in the middle 
the gallery where he stood ruminating for
some time in which situation he was found by
the earl athos as that nobleman came with
sir william chrichton and others in the
eings confidence to attend the council
what has befallen you said the earl
to him pausing as he passed leaning on the
arm sir william chrichton the others
with them passing on to the councilham
ber
his majesty replied stuart has dealt
unkindly by me he denies me the honour
 going with him against macdonald and
enjoins me to remain here
the earl athos somewhat surprised to
hear this dropped his hold the chancellors
arm as he said 
 why has his majesty done so did he
assign no reason 
sir william chrichton looked observant
the spaswife 
at the earl while he said this forster was a
degree haste and anxiety in the manner 
his question which struck hidot both as strange
and angular
 he thinks replied stuart that considering
how openly i have professed myself
to the lady sibilla it would not accord well
with that profession to be engaged in adventures
 warfare anst her father
 then it was not said the earl interrupting
him out respect to the relationship
in which you stand to the succession p
i doubt not interposed sir william
chrichton that his majesty has determined
wisely in this matter though he may not have
been governed by any regard to the successors
especially as the queen has declared
herself in the honoured condition increasing
their happiness
 how r exclaimed the earl with a lookin
which there was much the eagerness 
alarm is it as you say when did the queen
 the spaewife
announce it i have not heard it before
it surprises me to hear at this time such
an events

the king himself told mess said stuart
then it is true replied the earl addressing
himself to sir william chrichton 
 why should an occurrence so interesting tome
have been concealed from me p
 many shld regard mm as fated to die
early and be even cgktblting the success

think you sir william chrichton that
there is any thing in such forebodings said
the earl
the chancellor smiled and looking sharply
replied you do not think so my lord
for i have heard you repeatedly deride all
prognostications as vain superstition but
our time is up and his majesty will presently
be in the councilchambers
with which words they departed the earl
and the chancellor walking up the gallery
to the door by which the king had retired
and stuart slowly and thoughtfully passing
to the stairs which led down into the court
below where many young knights and gallants
were assembled armed and feathered
for the expedition all eager and glowing
in the might and manhood like eaglets in
the morning when they stand on the brink 
 the sfaewife
their champiiig ther beaks and flapping
their pinions impatient for the sun that
they may swoop to their quarry

among other events that came to pass about
the epoch these things whereof recital has
been made was the voluntary departure 
the disconsolate duchess albany from
pantaloon to the sinner lodge on inchmurrain
in lochlomond the only pedicle
that she could be moved to accept all the
princely earldom her ancestors therewith
the aged lady glenjuckie who had
come with her from falkland and patiently
partaken her captivity and sorrow she
was minded to pass the mournful remainder
 her days like some sequestered nun devoted
to abstinence and mourning
by the kings preparations to suppress
ths rebellion macdonald whose enterprise
she had heard the rumour though
s the spaewife
not her son the lord james being with
him her journey to lennox was rendered
slow and tardy for horses were difficult to
be had save such as were accounted no
worth either for road or raid and her venerable
gentlewoman being afflicted with a sei
attica could not abide the oscillations ans
other carriage that a litter on the mornings
however the plinth day her departure
from pantaloon the duchess reached the
margery the lake having travelled all the
preceding night hjr a lone and moorland
pay that she might eschew the dismal sight
 the towers by reason the
great lack df lufsesf in the towns and hostels
aa the roads
when she had reached the place where
she intended to embark no boat was at hand
and she was in consequence obligated to
remain on the shore till a messenger could
procure one from some stances fain would
 tbe gpaswife 
leddy glenjuckie hove persuaded her to go to
the castle ballot and to take up her
abode there for a season but the duchess
remembered that it was the scene her
joyful childhood and a woful train terrible
reminiscences that came with the thought
 what had befallen her since ie had left
it caused her tears to flow the anguish
 that grief however soon subsided into
the melancholy calm which had become almost
the habitude her mind and she sat
down on a rock close by the brim the lake
and resting her cheek on her hand awaited
the return her errand there was indeed
a soft and consolatory spirit abroad overall
nature at that time and its soundless
tranquillity was in unison with the meditations
 the weary heart
the day was grey still sober and mild
without sunshine or shower the winds were
asleep and almost also the waters the birds
were mute but not with sullenness and they
 the spaewife
shook the crystalline drops from the impearled
leaves as they busily pruned their
wings like gentle villagers preparing for
church in the holiness the sabbath coming
the skies were not darkened with any
loud but the mountain tops were hid ina
resting mist that hung like a canopy
lowered almost to the tufty hills the little
islands in the lake it was a morning when
the lowing cows and the bleating lambs
heard afar op mingling with the bark the
shepherds dog seem tuned and musical 
when doves coo on the windowsills the solitary
maiden who never listened to any other
note love and who feeds them with crumbs
treasured from her frugal supper when
daisies lift not their golden eyes but hang
their heads as if drowsy with some delicious
excess when bees pass from bloom to blossom
in silence when the dumb butterfly
that never spreads his wing but to the suns
rests as quiet as the peaflower on its stalk
the spaewife 
under the leaf that he has made his canopy 
and when the voiceless snail in his satin
doublet stretches his eyehoms from side to
side on the dewy sward as if he wist not
where to taste first like a sableventured
clerk at a banquet in sooth a season 
quietude and calm when wary grimalkin looking
out at the cottage door and fain to pass
to her lair beneath the bushes often puts
forth her foot to feel if indeed the soft air be
too moist for her furred delicacy

the duchess surprised by this salutation
rose suddenly and on looking beheld glenfru
in and several his clansmen who had come
out a birch and hazel wood that fringed
the border the lake close to the spot
where she was sitting
 the spaewife
her grace had known him in her youth
and she recognised his clansmen by their tartan
 but their appearance at that time and
the salutation glenfruin whom she quickly
recollected could not know her person so as
to justify the wonder he affected at seeing her
there caused her to suspect from his notour
character that he had come for no good
she however at once addressed him by name
and begged that he would send some his
men to assist the person whom she had already
missioned to procure a boat to carry
her to the island

the duchess soon discerned by what she
overheard their discourse that glenuin
had made her his prisoner and her gentlewoman
began to make audible lament at this
new misfortune and to bewail the mischance
which had thrown them into such rude custody
till her mistress chided her unavailing and
bootless complaint by saying
 we are in your power glenfruin two
poor old defenceless women with these few

make no resistance to your force were we
even so minded help me into the boat and

heavens to fill my cup with salt salt tears
there is however a sweet mercy in store
that i trust will hereafter make me forget

glenfruin with some endeavour at courtesy
proffered his arm to the duchess whereupon
his son beckoning to one the men to
draw near went with tenderness to the afflicted
lady glenjuckie and invited her to lean
upon them as she stepped from the rock into
the boat

looked at one another and all suddenly with
one accord vaulted into the saddles and galloped
away

and looking at the speed with which they
scoured along the hillside got's curse

duchess for seeing it was impossible to overtake
the fugitives he submitted to the disappointment
and calmly ordered the boatmen
to push off from the shore

chap v
while the realm was shaken by the rumours
and tidings that came hourly rushing from
inverness concerning the rebellion the lord
 the isles sir robert grasme who on his
banishment had instead going forth the
kingdom taken refuge among the wilds and
fastnesses derbyshire on hearing what had
happened went to join the rebels and reached
the tent macdonald on the evening 
the day on which the news arrived the
king's approach and the young lord robert
stuart having remained at the court because
 the marriage which his majesty had
settled to take place between him and the
lady sibilla
there when he entered he found macdonald
and the lord james in an eager and sharp
the spaewifk 
controversy the lord the isles being
seemingly much moved and disturbed by the
report the great force which the king was
bringing against them while the friendless
outlaw suspected that he was only desirous 
a pretext to return home because the rumoured
match which had been formed for his
daughter the which match considering the
then forlorn condition her first lover was
plain to all capacities a thing which the macdonald
would likely approve and prefer
accordingly after the first salutations and
welcoming were over they addressed themselves
to gramme as an umpire in their debate
the lord james beginning by inquiring if he
had in the course his journey heard any
account the army which the king was
bringing we are told said he that
it trebles ours and macdonald has become
afraid and thinks we ought to retreats
 i wish my lord interrupted the chieftain
 that you would measure your words
vol c
 the spaemtife
more according to the meaning ylur
mind i am not afraid but seeing how
slenderly vre are supported and the little dig
position shewn by any the old friends 
the albanies to take part with us i doubt if
it be wise to wait till king james come up
there are no such men as friends 
the albanies in scotland's replied gramme
sternly remembering in what manner they
had failed and faltered when he laid violent
hands on the king in parliament everyone
now seeks his own particular advantage 
and not the least grievance the parchment
laws our english tyrant for i account him
no scot albeit he was bon in the land is that
they supersede the virtue standing by one
another and reducing us all to be the thralls
 his judicatory and officers
you speak worthily sir robert said the
lord james and it was to restore the liberties
 former times that macdonald took up
arms but since he heard that his faithless
the spaewife 
daughter is to be wedded to stuart whose
chance inheriting the crown he accounts
better than an outlaws he sees the eings
forces through the mist and would persuade
me that they are all giants which he dare
not encounters
 i beseech you both exclaimed gramme
 to spare these reviling it may be discreet
my lord not to adventure too much at this
time a retreat is sometimes better than a victory
and since you have been so balked in
the hopes you had formed those who were
the friends your family friends while it
had any thing to give there may be wisdom
in macdonald avoiding the kings power
without supposing that he is thereto incited
by any sinister consideration on his daughters
account remember he is an open and declared
rebel and when you think the fate
 your own house you cannot but know that
the remission his offence will never be
granted by kmg james
 the paewipe
macdonald during this speech drew himself
back from the light that was on the table
before them and folding his arms listened
as an auditor who had no part in their colloquy
but with gathered brows and scowling
eyes which shewed how deeply it shook his
spirit
it is reported replied the lord james
to gramme when he paused that the king
has abated in his severity and indeed you
are yourself after what you attempted evidence
 the truth the report
how i cried gramme with a hoarse and
wrathful voice which however the rage was
rather the expression some agency the
memory than anger at the young lord 
call ye it an abatement severity to be
degraded below the basest condition man p
to live the life a hunted beast that hears
in every rustle the bramblebush where he
couches the dogs his pursuer recollect
what i was and think what i am now i am
the spaewipe 
here as a skulking and annpanionless 
you that to me an abatement severity
 the time was when only my whistle
could like the invocation a wizard change
the heather and the fern into crested warriors 
but the mocking the invisible echo is all
the answer that i should now receive if i
were to venture on the hills that were my own
to try the sound my voice 
if said the lord james looking round
to macdonald if the lord the isles can
endure to be such a thing let him make his
peace when he pleases with the king i
have no claim upon his friendhipsibiua's
faithlessness has dissolved our league
 your own taunts my lord have done
so exclaimed macdonald rising with scorn
on his lips and quitting the tent the lord
james resenting the manner his look laid
his hand on the hilt his dagger but greene
caught him firmly by the wrist and sud
 is it thus by quarrelling with your friends
 the pawif
that you hope to avenge your wrongs but
come we are both too long heres macon
enterprise is plainly at an and
though as his guests we may be safe yet if
it be that he wishes to make his peace with
the king who knows in what way he may be
worked upon to give us up
the lord james felt the full force what
gramme meant to convey and quitting his
seat hastily they left the tent together and
made for the hills they had not however
proceeded far when the young lord began
to repine at his precipitation and his uncourteous
manner thus abandoning several brave
gentlemen who had joined the macdonald
with their clansmen on his own account and
he urged gramme to return with him that he
might take such leave them as their spirit
and devotion to his cause deserved or perhaps
induce them still to adhere to his desperate
fortunes
gramme however strongly remonstrated
the spaewife 
against this disposition if hereafter said
he sullenness its strength rose
gloomily in the distance and the partizans
and battlements the towers seemed by the
upcast glare the campfires the besiegers
like the frowning eyes and gathered foreheads
 wrath jealousy and scorn
it was a scene that well accorded with the
hostile spirit gramme and he stopped to
look at it with a fierce enjoyment malignant
satisfaction
aye ye may gloom and glower robin
grammes cried a voice at his feet from amidst
the bushes on the steep but ye're ne'er get
your will nor your dues till you have humbled
yourself to your enemy and with
these words the spaewife scrambled up the
bank and with her rude stafip in her arms
stood before him
anniple said the lord james to her
for she was well known over all the country 
the spaewife 
both in hall and hostel where have you
come from tonight 
 x have nothing to say nor to space to you
lord james when the skein your fortune's
ravelled ye'll hear tell o me robin
grasme i rede ye to part frae him or yell
wrang yourself what ye're weel worthy and
eke a marriage mars
so come ye wi me and let him bide
and think nae what shall then betide
and ye'll blithe the heart o a bonny bride
that sighs in her bower alone robin
neither grasme nor the lord james had
any inordinate faith in treats but the veracity
 anniples foreknowledge had gained
great renown far and near and in that crisis
 their adventures especially as they at the
time wist not well which way to take they
were disposed to give her more credit than
perhaps they would have done on any other
occasion
c
 the spaewife
 shall i then be safe to return to inverness
said the lord james
if ye're to be hangt my lord yell ne'er
be drowns replied the spaewife
 but whither hould ye ample that i
should go interrupted gramme
up the hill and down the hill and ow
the water and up the hel and down the
hul and o'er the water and up the hill and
down the hill and o'er the water and there
yell meet wi a man that has the key a
castle
 and when in that keep ye're warded in
nor prince nor power in christendom
frae you that keep shall win
she promises you fair sir robert said
the lord james take her advice and here
let us separate for notwithstanding macdonald's
sordid perfidy i shall return to inverness
where i doubt not still to find
friends
the spaewife 
grseme again attempted to dissuade him
from returning and even began to jeer at
anniples predictions but she suddenly interrupted
im by laying her hand on his mouth
saying
 hush i hear macdonald breathing in
the wind listen hark he's passing afar off
in the valley
it was even so for when the lord james
went back to the camp he was informed that
the chieftain had set off alone to throw himself
on the eings mercy and he found all
the clansmen preparing to retire to their respective
regions in the isles and among the
hills thus were his hopes again blasted
while the anguish caused by the constancy 
his ill fortune was sharpened by the thought
 sibillas broken faith meanwhile sir
robert gramme pursuing his course southward
parted from the spaewife who asher
nature led wandered purposeless away
 the sfaewibe
chap 
many things were in the meantime growing
to fruit at the court where the lady sibill
on parting from stuart in the gallery
as set forth went straight to her aunt the
countess ross and told her that until
her father's enterprise was resolved and
determined she would give no farther tendance
on the queen in vain did that discreet
lady exhort her to the contrary and represent
that by being in companionship with
her majesty she might find means and opportunities
to mitigate the kings ire but
sibilla was not to be moved by any stress 
elocution so that she continued to abide with
the countess while the royal preparations for
the suppression the rebellious raid were in
the spaewife 
process seldom appearing abroad but in a sequestrated
and lately manner
it came however to pass that the king
being instructed how none the great barons
and chiefs the north whose clans and
preparations he stood most in apprehension
had joined the rebels but that in many parts
where the lord james and macdonald counted
on friends the only demonstration made
was for the royal cause his majesty resolved
only to send forward the vanguard his
power and to direct the lords and earls oii
whom he could rely to repair to their castles
and with their respective clans there await his
summons thus it happened that the earl
 athos went to his stronghold in the blair
or plain his country and there arrived with
a great host highlanders about the time
when sir robert gramme under the influence
and incitement the spaewife bent his
course southward but the young gallant
his nephew stuart went not with him being
s the spaewife
in furtherance the king's politic device
detained at edinburgh nothing loath in the
hope achieving the conquest the lads
sibillas true and invincible heart in that
adventure however he made but small progress
for when by the connivance the
counters ross he sometimes gained access
to her otherwise inaccessible sequestration
she gave little heed to his loving and fond
professions
 yoii wages said she to him one day
 a bootless war with me my heart is pledged
to a prince a royal nature and heroic
daring sto the heir the kingdom yea to
the open challenger the king and think
you that i will stoop to hear the dainty protestations
 any meaner man p
you amaze me lady replied stuart
i am the equal my rash cousin in everything
but his treasons
 and you are only not equal to him in them
because you lack the spirit to assert your own
the spaewtfe s
rights think you that he would so meekly
endure to be cut off from his inheritance by
any ordinance sordid timeservers such as
those were that gave the crown to the bastard
progeny elizabeth mure and defrauded
the lawful issue king robert the second
 their birthright 
stuart was amazed to hear her speak so
boldly and her taunts entered into the
qjliick his soul for he had ever felt as
his uncle the earl athos felt that the
posthumous law the succession was a
grievous injury to all the descendants 
the marriage with euphemia ross
which marriage till the enactment the
law had been accounted the only lawful
matrimony which that king had really contracted
notwithstanding the general commiseration
with which the fate the fair elizabeth
mure had been lamented he stood inconsequence
some time struck with wonder
which sibilla perceiving added scornfully
 the spaewife
 i doubt not there is treason in my words
my father and my betrothed husband are
in rebellion why should not i too think and
feel as a rebel but go complete the loyalty
 tamely submitting to be shut out from
your own rights by accusing me treason
why man if you had half the manhood that s
in the left hand your unfortunate cousin
the earl athos would long ere now have
been king and yourself the heir to the thrones
stuart trembled to see that the lady sibilla
while she thus spoke was pale and dreadful
her eyes flashing fire and the beauty her
countenance haggard with rage and contempt
i pray you sweetest lady said he softly
 let not such perilous thoughts escape
you why should the earl athos or myself
shake the kingdom from its propriety
with such old stories seeing that we are
placed by providence despite all human contrivance
to the contrary so very near the
throne
the spaewit'e 
 you mistake mess replied sibilla with a
haughty air i would not invite you to any
undertaking i but spoke that humility 
spiritchristian it is which so patiently
holds up the cheek to the smitten deeds
shew the man and i esteem you by what you
have proved yourself the only daring thing
you have ever done has been to offer yourself
to me as the rival your brave kinsman and
that very prudently my lord has been
most valorously adventured behind his backs
stuart felt as if his passion was entirely
quenched and he gazed at the flashing frenzy
 her eye and tle haggard energy her
colourless cheek and quivering lip with almost
irrepressible aversion but the feminine
fit was spent and while he stood contemplating
her with astonishment and marvelling
that he should ever have thought her lovely
or deserving to be loved the gentle spirit 
her nature returned and she sat down and
began to weep
the spabwife 
the sadness her voice and the soft solicitation
with which her eloquent eyes aided
the wish that he woidd desist from his importunate
devotion renewed with redoubled
tenderness the admiration which she had so
long inspired but the firmness with which
she declared her determination to accept only
the lord james taught him that his passion
was without hope twice he essayed to
speak and to tell her something the emotions
wherewith his bosom was agitated but
his tongue could find no words and he quitted
her presence torn with the conflicts rejected
love contemned manhood baffled desires
and protestations scorned
in the whirlwind this storm within he
hurried to the kings chamber to ask that he
might have leave to quit the court never to
return while sibilla was there but in going
thither he saw a great concourse people assembled
at the gate the guards and halberd
and archers all drawn out on hastily
 the spawif
inquiring what had chanced a confused response
by many tongues informed him that
the lord the isles had suddenly appeared
before the king while his majesty was at his
orisons in the chapelsome said he had attempted
the kings lifeand all agreed that
he had been seized on the spot and was then
in the abbey
so strange an accident made him at the
moment forget his own cares and rushing
through the guards he ascended the stairs to
learn the circumstances so singular an occurrence
as that the rebel should in such a
place and at such a time have presented
himself before the king
the spaewife 
chap vii
when stuart came into the eings presence
his majesty was walking to and fro in the
chamber plainly in great molestation mind 
and the queen was standing apart by herself
in the bower window seemingly deterred from
breaking in upon his cogitations by the violent
battle thought wherewith he was agitated
on observing them in this state stuart
would have retired but he perceived that on
his entrance the king had glanced his eye towards
him so that he was in a manner constrained
to remain and while he stood at the
door sir william chrichton with others 
the council came in upon whose appearance
his majesty mastered his feelings and resumed
his natural equanimity
 sir williams said the king on seeing the
 the spaewife
chancellor i send for you to determine
respecting this bold action macdonald
he has thrown himself on my honour and
mercy and yet how well we know he is not
to be trusted the cause his doing so sufficiently
verifies we had given him permission
to return unmolested home and to abide
in his island in peace but no sooner did an
occasion arise whereby he thought to advance
himself reckless the damage he might
cause to others than he again took the field
but he has placed himself defenceless in my
power and truly i pray heaven to instruct
me what i ought to do that my honour maybe
safe and the commonweal protected
the chancellor went respectfully up to the
king and said
 macdonald in so casting himself into the
hands your majesty if we may judge by
his heretofore actions has not done so from
that nobility motive which entitles him to
appeal to the judicature honour but has
the spaewife 
been compelled by some constraint circumstance
which he could not master or is actuated
by what with him is a no less forcible
argument some view advantage in either
case he merits but the same treatment and
the law and the commonweal claim the first
considerations
 i know au that's replied the king quickly
i discern all that but then he has
thrown himself into my own hands and i am
forced to consider not only what as a king i
must do but likewise what to preserve my
knighthood unstained i ought to do is it
think you possible that there may be any
duty the monarch inconsistent with the honour
 the man 
i should think not replied sir william
chrichton sedately
then what the king's part is said his
majesty i have long studied to know and
perhaps not altogether in vain for i have
never considered royalty by its trappings
wyiwsfe
th spaewife 
has but to follow the light your own
wisdom in this matter
then interrupted the king as he
has thrown his life into my hands let him
have it but you and others who are the
king's officers look well that no mischief ensue
 for he will hourly count on some remissions
whatever you may determine concerning
himself or his estate if his daughter accept
our cousin stuart the renown which
match and not contrition as he professes has
alone i question not brought him hither
stuart at these words stept forward and
said let him not then reckon any longer on
that nor his sentence be measured by any
chance his daughter becoming my wife
the hope that is quenched
 how r cried the king what is this 
when was this 
 it is so and please your majesty ten
kingdoms would not bribe me to address myself
again to the lady sibilla
vol d
 the spaewife
the king looked at hisof for a moment
gravely and then with pleasantry iinid 
 but one smile inay
 noi never she is not what i thought die
was i have been blind ta her defects albeit
i must still do homage to h beauty's
i fy stuart to disparage a lady whom
you have so icmg worshipped is to acknowledge
some defect m yourself it augurs but
little for your vaknur to be daunted by a
maidens fivwn
sir william chrichton and those who had
come with him peeing his majesty falling
into this easy vein withdrew and the queen
coming forward also began to jeer stuart on
bang so fainthearted but the scorn with
which sibilla had spdcen ins tameness
made his temper as it were skinless to raillery 
in so much that the king seeing him so
easily teased yielded to the sportive raahce
which his querulousness provoked and galled
him with jibes
the spawif 
nay bald his majesty if thou hast
lost not only thy heart thy suit but even
thy temper truly we must account thee as
having some out this adventure poorly
indeed beshrew me if any damsel in the
fiinmoe a gossips tongue will choose thee
for her champion 
he that would thfiye with lady bright
moat ponte hundf in au points a knight
boairtlnl and hire and leady to fights
 i entreat a parley said stuart sharply
 ymir majesty doesn't impute to me any
diffidence with respect to fighting
the king laughing to see him so chafed
and beixig minded to prick him still more re
plied
why did you not prefer dallying herewith
die ladies to the rude grappling 
maodonalds kerns nay i do not impute
it teryouasany defect wifidomftnr verily
 it hai a pleasant thing to be amidst the
tinkling ladies tongues in a perfumed
 the spaewife
clamber than to abide the dissonance 
blows and bagpipes amid the bleak winds 
 the highland hills
did your majesty exclaimed stuart
with some lack his usual homage but
command me to remain here that i might be
afterwards so scoffed at 
the king perceiving that he had touched
him nearer the quick than he intended and
being disturbed thereat said but a truce
with our controversy i would not have you
so abruptly renounce sibilla merely because
you may have found her today in an ungracious
mood 
his majesty would have added something
more but stuart cried abruptly trembling
with passion why am i to be ruled in
my affection's in these your subjects maybe
left free
the king looked at him with surprise
and taking the queens hand turned away
as he said with a smile
the spaewife 
by suppertime perhaps you may have
recovered one your losses the greatest
if it be not found cousins mean your
wonted good humour
so saying he led the queen away leaving
stuart alone who thereupon began to pace
the floor clenching his hands and using
those vehement gestures which betray vindictive
meditations while from time to time
he exclaimed 
he kept me with himself made me his
companion lulled me by a show friendship
 and while the world saw the cunning
 his policy i have been despised for continuing
so long blind yes i have deserved
both his taunts and the contempt sibill
but i am not a worm to be ever
trod upon nor a snail always to shut my
eyes at the approach danger and let it come
he would not have dared to treat me as he
has done today were not macdonald the
last friend the unfortunate albanies in his
 the spaewife
power but now he vmtuzes openly to shew
what he tends the condition die queen
give him the promise heirs from himself
he is afraid my elder rights so uignsdy
set aside by our common grandfather he
seeks a pretext to make his other kindred
take the road poor old murdoch and his
sons but i will match his cunning with cunning
and haply when he least expects its
i may find a way to realize his fears yes
silnlla i thank thee at least for that favour 
in telling me what i ought to have been
thou hast taught me what i am what i am
destined to be time will shew but my fate
hangs by a maidens honesty so said the
spaewife and that prediction was the shadow
 my hope with sibillabut shadow
and substance i am now rack as to her
and my spirit is the lighter for still when
she seemed inclined to favour my suit i
thought her first betrothment and the
love that she continued to cherish for the
the spaewifb 
outkcv often damped the ardcnir my passion
but now i am free her iafluanoe
over my lorraine is ended and i thank her
finite taunts that have roused me to the
sense my rights and shamed away the
base lethargy that has so long withheld me
from asserting themes
in this manner sometimes with vows 
vengeance for the contumely with which he
supposed the king had treated him at
others with complaints against his own supineness
in being restrained from vindicating
his birthright by the false loyalty he had
learnt from the earl athos did he continue
to pace the chamber for a season and
ever and anon he rejoiced that he was no
longer the thrall hopeless love and that
if his destiny was indeed subject to a maiden's
honesty it was not by sibilla he would receive
his doom alas poor youth he knew
not that by the upbraiding wherewith she
had chafed his spirit the impulse had been
 the spaewife
given which was then hurrying him on to the
consummation his destiny but it is ever
so with us all children fate to whom
it surely is ruled that the things most fatal
should ever seem the fairest for in nothing
which affects our particular selves can we
discern either the springs or the issues 
the influences that govern fortune
the spaewife 
chap viii
sib hobebt gbieme had in the meantime
after parting from the spaewife pursued his
course southward by moorland tracks and
mountain paths far remote from the highways
her words dwelt in his spirit as he waded
alone the solitude the heath and he felt
that the rocks might become as the morass
and the flexible windlestrae as the stubborn
pine but that he could never humble himself
before the man who had driven him to such
perdition honour and substance and servitude
all that made life to him worth the
having so he accounted the king
for three days with but such casual fare
as the sheilins the shepherds on the hills
would afibrd he kept his solitary way when
his limbs were weary and his feet torn with
the harsh roots the heather and the sharp
d
 the spajswifk
splinters rifted stones in his untrodden
path he would sit down on the bare comer
 some clichy rock and scowl around on the
deserts heather that covered all the expanse
in view and when peradventure he sometimes
saw the wolf skulking below sad
glancing towards him a hungry eye he grudge
ingle thought the bondage untamed on the
condition man and the cruelty in his
blood thickened
at night he chose his lair in the hollow the
hills and often when gathered in his plaid a
stone his pillow as he saw the moon and the
stars hurrying over him like fades through
the clouds and heard the winds passing
around and the roar waters sullenly rising
from afar he has started from the ground
and grasped the hilt his dirk to draw it
against his own fierce heart but still the
thought dying unrevenged checked his
purpose and nerved him to endure the misery
 unsatisfied hatred a little longer then

he wold lay himself down again and after

devoir him in dreams the wolf that 
all day hai been scared by the inward

the running to him brought no light but
candy the badness fate for as he approached
towards the glens that lead into the lowlands
he lpeeted to meet some the royal
amy then streaming in from the south by
all the divers passes to surround the rebels at
inverness and the apprehension falling
into their hands was as dreadful as the fantasies
whit superstition creates in the darkish
 night it would baffle his remorseless
intent the fear which made him
lurk iniens and woods by days and move in

salutation which he received when under the
shadow a cloud in passing the third night
round the comer a rock in badenoch he
stumbled over glenfruin who with a numerous
company his clansmen was so far advanced
towards the appointed headquarters
 the royal army and had there laid themselves
down to rest without ward or sentinel
having no dread an enemy in that place
in the same moment that the chief so
spoke the glenfruins started from their beds

grseme seeing that it would be no avail
to controvert his condition at that season
threw himself on the gixmnd and two 
the clansmen one at each shoulder sat down
to watch and to ward bend him glenfruin
stretched himself also wrapt in his paid

sir robert gramme never having before
met glenfruin and not being acquainted with
 the spaewife
the depth his devices was so far thrown
off his guard by this observation that he
said from the smarting his own punishment

justice and suffering now a days in scotland
are nearly the same thing and law is the
disguise tyranny
glenfruin pricked up his ears but gramme
felt that he had said too much and to lessen
the impression added so say the eings
enemies but this rebellion being over as i

hear less such disloyalty

gramme was however now on his guard and
glenfruin perceiving after divers other endeavours
to draw him farther on that it would
be no avail composed himself for the remainder
 the night
the spaewife 
in the meantime the earl athos as rehearsed
had come to the castle blair and
had there gathered the main power his vassals
to be in readiness to join the being when his
majesty would come up with the lowlanders
but more exact information having reached
edinburgh the strength the rebels than
the magnified wonderment the first rumour
the king had resolved not to head the army
himself but to send forward the warlike earl
 angus accordingly it came to pass as
told in the foregoing chapter that his majesty
was still at holyrood when macdonald
arrived to cast himself on his mercy 
this event the earl athos received the
first intimation from stuart his nephew who
on the same night that gramme so chanced to
fall into the hands glenfruin came suddenly
to the castle having in the afternoon
 the day wherein he was so chafed both by
the lady sibilla and the king obtained his
majesty's permission to go thither th e king
 the pabwife
had indeed with sorrow observed the inebriation
 chagrin wherewith the lady sibiuas
irreversible refusal had infected his brain
and holding him in great affection on account
 his many knightly qualities and hitherto
unblemished fidelity as a kinsman and true
subject was right well content to give him
have to retire into athos till the sore his
heart was delved by the mollifying ministrations

f 
t
the spaewife 
chap 
now it came to pass that the same night
after the lady athos had retired to hae
chamber the earl with his nephew remained
sitting together by themselves in a turretroom
discoursing divers matters wherein stuart
from time to time breathed his discontent
against the king for though standing in
awe his uncles renown for loyalty h was
fearful to give utterance to the imprisoned
thought which his majestys free nature had
so innocently bred yet waa he not altogether
able to repress the adder nor to keep the fascinations
 its eye from attracting the fated
spirit the earl
 he has no respects said stuart as we
have seen even for the dignity hip own
blood but uke the ottoman considers high
kinroblfthesei shoulduub cu 
the spaewife 
have been right king scotland t beseech
you to consider that and how much we
both you as my rightful heir are placed
within the scope his jealousy especially
now that the queen is in the way to be a
mother
 how is it my lord that you have so
quietly endured that great injustice 
you are too young to remember the
boundless domination the regent robert
poor duke murdoch's father else you would
not ask that question and wherefore should
i a childless old man stir in any rash unavailing
pretension for to do the king justice
since his restoration he has greatly caused good
order and security to abound albeit too
harsh in his ministry towards many the nebilly

o there was a time exclaimed stuart
when any sovereign to have breathed against
the old free prerogatives the scottish nobles
but a moiety what the king has done by his
 the pakwifje
alights law and judicature would hare raised
the whole land like a whirlwinds
 you give your anger too wide a license
nephews rested the earl i must not
suffer you to fall into suchhakits discourse
especially now when the whole realm is again
submissive to his dominions
 but the world said stuart think
our ubmbaodmine at least to come a
tame spirit i cannot brook to have mysdf
anger so unworthily considered
 hush these are rade words nephew
what would you do p
 have yoa not told me that but for the
treble injustice which gave the crown to the
bastards elisabeth mure you should hate
this day been king scotland 
 i charge you talk not such things in
that way rash young man i i would but
do my duty were i to give you up fi viewing
sa much a seditious spirit
stuart was somewhat rebuked by the warmth
the spaewtfk 
 the earl and made no rnimatiatp rcfay at
last he said
 it is current among the commonalty that
it has been prophesied you will be eing
 so i have heard and when it is considered
that there is but the king now between
me and the throne it is no improbable event
notwithstanding my years
anniple dunblane rejoined stuart
long ago told me that my fate 
annie dunblane r interrupted the
earl surely you set no store by the ravings
 the taoiaway what man in the possession
 a sober mind would give heed to
her jargon 
 but many her sayings i have often
beard have some to pass she has a diary
and very angular discernment what passes
in the minds those to whom she speaks for
it is with but few that she will hold any dis
coune
the complexion the earl went a little at
 the spaewife
this remark and he looked around unconsciously
as if somewhat alarmed and then

it is ordained that i am to come to the
crown and but one life now stands in the
way the event will come to pass without any
ministry thereto on my part but nephew
let not your thoughts run upon such malcontent
fancies seek rather to earii as i have
all my life done the esteem the wise and
the good it will better pave the way to a
quiet succession when the time may come
than any stratagem human artifice in which
you can engage i pray you also never to
break this matter again to me i am an old
man this grey head can ill bear the burden
 a helmet and any other way than the
course providence needs the mediation 
arms
think you then my lord exclaimed
stuart that i can patiently abide the taunts
 a usurper for such i will think he is batthe
spaewife 
ing all that parchment can say to the contrary
you may permit him to possess your rightthat
is your own concern my lord but he
has wounded me past all cure he has put
salt into the wounds
the earl on seeing stuart rushing into
this vehemence rose and said you must
find other ears than mine to breath your
treasons to is my honour as a subject so
blemished that you dare to tempt me with the
dotage dream setting aside king james
the greatest stain that ever my loyalty suffered
has been in the freedom with which

querulous resentment i will embark rash

the earl remained evidently in great agitation
he moved several paces from the spot
where he was standing and clasped his
hands and looked very wild and woebegone
then he again sat down and bent his head
upon his hand resting on the table and continued
for some time uke a marble image 
cogitation suddenly he started up and
moved round the chamber many times with
perturbed steps often raising his hands and
shaking them as one that eschews the presence
 some very dreadful sight anon
he would touch his aged locks and look at
his shrivelled hands and fold them together
and remain with a melancholy air and sigh
and almost weep
but these fond struggles did not last long 
for ever and anon his evil angel would come
upon him and nerve him with pride making
his age seem less and brightening his countenance
with a royal arrogance which soon
however changed into a dark and cruel look
the spaewifb 
then he would stalk hurriedly and stealthily
across the room holding his hand as if he
grasped a murderous knife but in that
hideous attitude the fiend was repulsed and
he fell upon his knees and with bitter tears
cried woefully to the heavens
 i have not made a compact with perdition
bring not dishonour upon this old
head which with the halo grey hairs you
have yourselves so adornedyea and anointed
with the benedictions good men more
preciously than the unction could have done
with which the prophet samuel consecrated
david against saul
then having thus prayed he rose and as
if fearful to trust himself with the awful
controversy his own thoughts he hastily
seized the light that stood upon the table
and without calling as his custom was for
the tendance any servant hastened into his
ladies bower

next morning being duly advertised that
the rebellion the macdonald was at an
 and the different clans engaged therein
dispersed and retired to their respective
countries the earl sent home likewise his
vassals and prepared to return to his lodging
in perth the court being minded to come
to scone where the king expected his attendance
but in the course the day it
came to pass that glenfruin having with him
air robert grseme arrived at the castle and
being taken to the earl narrated in what
manner the prisoner had fallen into his hands
and that he much doubted if he was as he
had pretended to be the bearer tidings to
the king
for you see mi lord eerl said glenthe

the earl commended the discernment and
dexterity glenfruin and lauded the alert
loyalty with which he had obeyed the first
summons the king to rendezvous with his
clansmen at the place appointed telling him
that he would not fail to report his great
merits to his majesty
 and yell pe pleasured mi lord and

endeavour to stand well with all men he
spoke fair and with sweet words to the old
chieftain at the same time giving him no
encouragement to expect that the king would
consider his services at so high a price as he
had himself put upon them
for you know glenfruin said he that
among the english where the king was so
long bred true subjects are expected to do
their duty without reward albeit their kings
sometimes bestow small marks favour where
the merit is very singular i do not however
say that his majesty will not discern the
merits your services and reward them even
with much more than the lands whereof you
have spoken but there may be persons about
the king who may represent those lands as 
more value than you think they are and you
know his majesty is in all matters touching
the property the crown guided by the determinations
 his councils
 sowlls and podies mi lord and eerl it

yes replied the earl this same thing
the public keeps many an honest man from his

particular grievances i am sure there is no
man in the realm who has more reason to complain

you were too faithful a subject to henry the

look to the consequences unless he has a
friend to appease the king
glenfruin was not quite easy in his
mind at hearing the earl speak in this manner
and not well knowing what answer to
make he said
 put will na mi lord and eerl pe pleasured
to see te sings message tat pe in te

 if he be as'you seem to suppose sir
robert grasme i am almost sorry replied
the earl that he has been brought hither

 nevertheless replied the earl since he
is now in custody i will keep him a prisoner
till i have the king's orders concerning him
and what will glenfruin pe doing wite
laidie tooches sowlls and bodies 
oomph
the earl paused for a moment he
thought if he advised the chieftain to restore
her at once to liberty the veteran would
thereby pacify his majesty's displeasure at
the manner in which he had treated that disconsolate
lady but otherwise his sordid loyalty
might be changed and as the thought
presented itself he turned away from glenruin
and walked to the upper the gallery
where they held this discourse saying in
bitterness heart to himself
 oh cruel fate hurry me not so fast 
let me take time to breathe
th paewife 
he then returned with quick steps to glenruin
and said
 sir robert greene is well known to all
in my household and i was already informed
that he was your prisoner before you were
admitted
oomph replied glenfruin looking curiously
from under his brows
yes rejoined the earl but i do
not wish to embroil myself further in the
afbsdrs gramme i give you leave to let
him be held in custody here till the ejng's
pleasure concerning him be known
gramme had not however in the meantime
been idle in his thoughts and knowing the
jeopardy wherein he stood he had so addressed
himself to stuart who on his being
brought to the castle had gone to see lum in
the hallas not only to move him to compassionate
his condition in the distemperature
wherewith that iufated youth was at the time

the spabwipb ill
there was no man that time who could
so eloquently enforce his argument as sir
robert gramme and the elocution with which
he set forth this seeming lowly request obtained
a ready concurrence from stuart who
not only assisted him in forthwith preparing
the memorial his professions contrition
for past offences but in carrying it to the
earl he added many things in the prisoner's
behalf expressing however his doubt if the
king would grant any part the humble
boon solicited and reverting with sharp
words to the contumely as he felt it the
eings treatment himself the earl
however in taking the paper said nothing
but his countenance was pale and his lips
quivered and hastily putting it into his bosom
he retired into another apartment to conceal
the agitation with which he was so very
strangely affected

while macdonald and his hasty adventure
so suddenly abandoned was causing such
molestation throughout the realm and bringing
so many fatal circumstances to a confluence
the duchess albany with her faiths
ful companion the aged leddy glenjuckie
was patiently wearing the time away in the
castle glenuin as a prisoner under the
watch and ward nigel and a party the
clansmen
the lady glenfruin and her two daughters
with many gentle ministrations endeavoured
to sweeten her captivity but to her
grace all things and all places were alike
her prisonhouse was life and if at times she
seemed to be touched with any sense morthe

tat sympathy it was in the still the golden
evening when she sat on the brow the
castlehill looking abroad on the tranquillity
 the lake below and listening to the mournful
melody some highland sonnet and wailing
coronach chanted by old north as she
teased her wool or twirled her distaff on the
stone seat at the castle gate
but leddy glenjuckie who suffered no
grief save that pity for the misfortunes 
her mistress the which like the sorrows 
other waiting gentlewomen was shielding to
the balm time and save the occasional anguish
 her own sciatica passed the day with
more variety having from her youth been
habituated to the silken courtesies a courtly
life she could ill abide the mountain fare
and heather couches glenfruins tower
and the offence which the yellow necks and
bare red arms his long and lean daughters
gave to her delicate eyes at her arrival was
scarcely extenuated by the unmitigated civis

chained spomeljes and pu palls and
liowf when she was a maid honour to the
the spaewipe 
regent roberts duchess duke murdoch
mother she had a milkwhite spanish jennet
trapped to the ground with velvet and cloth
 gold nor did she forget the pretty page
in his gay attire that went with her when she
took the pastime hawking with the ladies
 the court carrying on his arm her eagle
horn and merlin with their silver bells
but welladay she would often in those
pleasant rehearsals say with a sigh the decay
 the world is plain to be seen sir
penny has become the king the earth 
and then she would recite with good emphasis
trippingly on the tongue certain pithy morsels
 the lay wherein his domination is celebrated
saying 
popes kings and emperors
bishops abbots and priors
parson priest and knight
dukes earls and ilk baron
to serve him are they all born
both by day and night
 the spaewife
in the king's court it is no boot

he is so witty and so strong

he will make it right
sir penny over au gets the gree

in castle and in tower 
without either spear or shield
he is the best in faith or field
and stalwarthest in stour
on these occasions the daughters glen
ruin would beseech her to repeat the same
till they got the rhymes by rote it not being
the custom in those days for young ladies 
their degree even many degrees higher to
read the minstrelsy books
but leddy glenjuckie did not always seek
to move her admiring auditors by instructive
descants in the vein prince achilles complaint
to the which so many laureates in afterthe
spaewifs 
times have played the mumbling echo some
for mockery and some for moan taking their
text from those sad rhymes the longest lay
 the learned lydgate 
 for like it is that all the gentle blood
throughout the world shall destroyed be
and rural folk and that were great pitied
shall have lordship and whole governance 
and charles eke with sorrow and nuachance
in every land shall lordis be alone
and gentlemen be slain all every one
changing the key her humour and running
the diapason a livelier mood she would
then rehearse the adventures ladies and
gallants and other tendering and quaintly
tell what mischance to a fair damsels
she rose that lady dear
to take her leave her squyere

she stood her chamberdoor besom
then said she was the time when it
was worth something to be fair i was not

many furrows in these cheeks was not alway
my foe well do i remember when as a
champion he challenged to prove my beauty
without a marrow on a day that was to come
and it did come and many a stricken knight
with a bleeding heart lay at my feet
then would she ever and anon give these
simple damsels who much marvelled to hear
an ancient dame with a shaking head discourse
with such juvenility much sage counsel
how to comport themselves in what she
called the maidens war telling them how the
loathly woman won sir forest citing many
a delectable sentence from that pleasant romaunt
the which in those days was as familiar
in the lowland halls and bowers as ever
the poesie mightier minstrels hath since
been
but albeit that antique gentlewoman so
vaunt her victorious beauty and so dis

coursed stratagems love to these mountain
maidens yet was she in all points touching
the moralities demeanour singularly delicate
yea most dainty and circumspect else
would not the duchess albany have endured
her services there had chanced
however a certain accident in her life before
she was married to the first her four husbands
and by it as an epoch she was wont
to date the occurrence events saying that
such and such things had come to pass so
long before or after her misfortune which
misfortune was a damage that she met with
by the fall a gallery wherein she was sitting
with other ladies the court to see the
joustihgs held at perth on the occasion the
coronation king robert the second and
by which she was ever after crippled from
dancing to the great grief according to her
own rehearsal the king and all his nobles
so much did she excel in the art
in this manner the time passed away with
lao the paewife
leddy glenjuckie till glenfruin returned
home and a very wroth ul and irascible man
he was when he came not only because he
had found no rebellious town to indemnify
his clansmen for the brisk loyalty with which
they had obeyed the kings mandate to go
against macdonald but also in consequence
 the earl athos doubts if his majesty
would be content to hear that the unfortunate
duchess was held as a prisoner in his castle
the consideration also with which the earl
and his nephew treated sir robert gramme did
not content him he not only expected that
immediate execution would have been done on
the outlaw but had cherished the hope that
for the notable service he had himself rendered
to the state in bringing him in no question
would be made about granting the pedicle
 the earldom lennox which lay so conveniently
to augment his estate

son in relating the adventure isn't a shame

oomph
but nigel instead sympathizing with his
disappointment or the impoverishment which
the clan had so unprofitably sustained in the
expedition began to speak in very tender and
compassionate terms the duchess and to
suggest that as her detention might not be
agreeable to the king it would be expedient
to carry her as soon as possible in a befitting
manner to the summer bower in inchmurrain

the old man looked at him with a stem
eye from under his brows crooking his head
like a ram preparing to assault an adversary

at this juncture their conversation led

where the duchess was sitting alone the
lady glenfruin being busy with north in
another apartment seething worsted with

the chimneycomer where he was sitting and
said

leddy glenjuckie who had never been afflicted
with such a salutation dropped the

beheld some shaggy boar or other uncouth

to be courteous in order that no com

took his daughters again by the arms and
with short quick steps mottled as fast as she

quite unconscious any offence rose and advanced
to proffer his gallant assistance to help

in the meantime the lord james after the
breaking up macdonald enterprise became
very despondent his fortunes and
was grieved even to that sickness the heart
which is a keener pang than the anguish 
wounds by the reported inconstancy the
lady sibilla
in the morning when he saw the clansmen
 the isles departing homeward and all the
array that had come to maintain his cause
melting away he stood alone on the side 
craig patrick and meditating on the eclipse
 his father's house resolved to leave the
scottish strand for ever and to sail to the
isle rhodes there to seek admission into
the brotherhood the knights st john
and it chanced that while he was in this
 the paewife
forlorn and disconsolate state celestine 
loch aw a kinsman his own suddenly appeared
coming from the bottom the hill
the mother this celestine being the
daughter the regent robert was aunt to
the outlaw and her son had inherited from her
the partialities and affections oi the albanies 
but his father sir duncan campbell was a
warrior renowned loyalty and in all things
a firm upholder the kings administration
it chanced that when the tidings the lord
james arrival at inverlochy from ireland
reached celestine that he was hunting the red
deer on ben clachan with but a few followers
 and on the pretext still pursuing
the chase he passed the mountains at the
head loch ranch and stirring the country
to the north loch erich had only that
morning come from dalwhinnie to the camp
so that the lord james on being told his
name though he joined hands with him as a
kinsman knew not in what way his affections
the pabwfe 
leant and he was the more disposed to distrust
him seeing him alone and in the garb 
a hunter because the notour devotion to
the king which his father sir duncan campbell
cherished he would therefore have
gladly avoided him but the melancholia
manner in which celestine had seen him standing
alone leaning on the hilt his broadsword
much moved the young chieftain 
the campbellss and he not only tried to cheer
him with many exhortations to constancy 
mind but with anticipations better chances
in the affection undivulged friends
i see not said he your condition in so
dismal a plight come with me to kilchum
castle for my father is now with the king at
edinburgh there as you aie unknown
you may for a time abide in security till we
hear what good fortune is yet in store for
you
but the lord james replied how may
i trust myself in the hands the campbellss
w
ik
appearance these werau the tram that ce
destine hath with him and'he briefly told them
the spaewife 
how they were to comport themselves towards
the prince sto die in his defence and to put
to death whomever they suspected meditating
any wrong against him
they made no response but looked at the
lord james and then each taking the other
by the hand they enclosed him around thereby
intimating that they were as one and as
such would defend him
the cloud that had fallen upon the spirit
 the lord james was cleared away by this
courageous demonstration and he took his
kinsman by the hand saying 
i throw myself celestine upon you and
the honour your clan carry me wheresoever
you please
thus it came to pass that on the same day
on which sir robert gramme was taken by
glenfruin to the earl athos the lord
james in the company his kinsman
arrived at kilchurn on loch aw side
where under the name sir aulay macau
f
iso the paewife
lay cairndhue a famous hunter in those
days he was introduced to the seneschal and
other the officers
but the lady had no sooner cast her eyes
upon him than she discovered the swarthy
lineaments her father's race and at once suspected
his name and degree but she repressed
her surprise and emotion not knowing whether
her son had any suspicion the rank 
his guest whom he spoke as having fallen
in with at the chase and had brought to taste
the apples broach plain and to prove the
good cheer kilchum for a night
 i trust however said celestine that
it will fare ill with us if we cannot tempt him
to abide a little longer for there are deer in
knapdale a bolder breed than any he has
yet driven in coal or lorn
this speech made the lady loch aw
still more suspect that celestine had no imagination
 who his guest was while the suspicion
which the appearance the lord
the paewife 

james had at the first sight inspired was confirmed
by the sound his voice when he rejoined
in a seeming simple manner
 i shall gladly partake your pastime
for a day or two and had i my own hounds
here i doubt not we should have good
sport
 then you have left your dogs in lennox
 said the lady and she looked significantly
as if she wished he might divine the
equivocal sense her question nor was he
dull discerning what she meant
 yes lady said he the best i have are
there i should say had for they are no
longer mine
celestine without having observed the earnestness
with which his mother had regarded
their guest and not particularly noting the
strain this discourse here interposed sayings

him and he was obliged to turn aside to conceal
his agitation and sorrow
celestine saw his emotion and would have
immediately disclosed the secret to his mother
but at that moment a messenger came into the
chamber width letters from sir duncan saying
how much he took it to heart to hear it reported
that their son celestine had joined macdonald
at inverness and praying it might not
be so telling her at the same time in what
manner the rebellious chieftain had come secretly
to holyroodhouse and had there thrown
himself upon the eings mercy
seing her son then present and having received
no gn nor intimation from him to
make her think he had embarked in the rebellion
at the same time fearful lest the stranger
should be indeed sir aulay macaulay
she did not venture to say or do any thing
that might bring on a disclosure from celestina
 for the rebellion being ended by the
manner in which macdonald had surrendered
s th spaewife
himself it became necessary to keep the secrets
 those who had engaged in it and she
knew not how sir aulay macaulay stood affected
either with respect to the king or to
the albanies all this caused a sudden air
 restraint and embarrassment to become visible
in her demeanour and she gave the
letter to celestine in so particular a manner
that he retired towards a window to read it
apart
the lord james remarked what was passing
and seeing mystery and the interchange
 expressive looks between the lady and her
son became uneasy and doubted the safety
that he had been promised and his apprehensions
were augmented almost to alarm by
the lady while celestine was reading the
letter in the windowbower coming to him
and saying softly that she might not be overheard

you know sir aulay that duke murdoch
was my brother and therefore i beseech
the spaewife 
you if you have heard any tidings the
lord james to let me know what you have
heard p
these words she accompanied with so much
 tenderness and grief in her voice and a
look so much more pregnant than her words
that he could not but discern she had discovered
him while by what he had noted he
was led to think she desired it might still bethought
that she knew him not instead
therefore making any reply he took her
hastily by the hand and glancing with alarm
towards celestine said to her in a whisper
save me 
knowing how much her son leant to her
affections for the relics her father's family
she would have assured the lord james that
he was safe to trust himself with celestine
whom she now supposed entirely ignorant 
his true name and condition but the rebellion
being over and the rigour the eings
justice having taught her to dread the cones
the spaewife
quinces that might ensue to those who had
taken any part in it and anxious to keep celestina
free from all suspicion blame believing
that the rumour his having been at inverness
was unfounded she deemed it prudent
to allow him to remain in his supposed ignorance
and still to affect to treat her nephew
as sir aulay macaulay accordingly when
she perceived that celestine had made an 
 reading his father's letter she said t
him
i beseech you to call home your brothers
coin and galespic whom i see yonder
in a boat on the loch by themselves go
i b for they are yet but mere boys and
the wind is strong and their sail broad
celestine looked from the window and saw
his brothers but in bo such jeopardy as his
mother seemed to fear she however feigned
to be still more alarmed in so much that
he was obliged to go hastily leaving the
lord james alone with her her anxiety
the spaewifjs 
was however but a device to procure an
opportunity conferring with her nephew in
secret and also to remove her son from the
danger being accused abetting in any
manner his outlawed and sentenced kinsman

 this house said she the moment they
were by themselves is no place for you
and then with a hasty summons she called
father donich her confessor and chaplain
whom with a brief injunction she desired to
convey him unobserved if possible to his cell
on irish ail one the small islands in the
lake he will remain with you there till
i have time before the evening to devise
some way conducting him to a place 
greater security
the weight his misfortunes so pressed
upon the spirit the lord james when he
found himself betrayed as he thought by the
perfidy his kinsman into a place danger
that he parted listlessly from the lady 
 the spaewife
loch aw and followed the old mon out 
the castle heedless and almost unconscious
 the way he went but they had not proceeded
far till indignation against his treacherous
kinsman as he deemed celestine roused
his spirit and perceiving that there was faith
and truth in the character father donich
he disclosed himself to him and after some
controversy wher the chaplain urged him
to trust to the lady loch aw it was
agreed that they should travel into lennoxshire

church for there is not one mlyoiu brethren
whether he wear mitre or bowl that
more truly reveres the blissful tidings re
the spaewife 
legion than does the sinner that how speaks
to you but to pierce the heavens with golden
pinnacles like our holy ancestor is not in
my poor judgment the best way to gain admission
 yet something is due from me in
token gratitude for the success which has
hitherto crowned my endeavours to resuscitate
justice and the renovation law in
scotland and i shall speedily evince the
sincerity my desire to prove that this is no
profession idle coinlesy
these words were comfortable in the ears
 the churchmen and so emboldened the
superior the black friars dumbarton
that he settled forward and said 
 but it is not enough for your majesty to
consider only the condition the religious
houses we beseech you to look at the great
molestation which we sustain in our goods
and persons many laies meddle with things
ecclesiastical in a way never before heard 
in any christians eland there was a pious
s the paewife
brother my house by name father mungo
o he was a precious vessel a light and
an ornament to all the church
 what him p said the king
 on the very same night in which your
majesty so happily rescued the town dumbarton
from the lord james an uncircumcised
highland shore put him to death whe
ther his martyrdom was by tree or by steel by
flood or by fire we have never learnt bong
in no condition to bring the criminal to justice

 on that night said his majesty 
did the friar whom you speak
belong to bishop finlays friends for you
know father that it has been quite as much
lie custom for ecclesiastics to meddle with
things secular as for laies to meddle with
things ecclesiastical
 o no r replied the prior the black
friar father mungo was a guileless saint
he was not a man that would have joined
the pairife s
himself to any plot such a traitor as bishop
finland
 then perhaps he was on our side and
the chieftain what was his name 
glenfruin
 glenfruin was he engaged in that rebellion
 surely i have heard this story before

 that were a hard thing to say for at
least he took no open part in the works
the king made no remark on this but
for a short space communed with himself and
then said
 but however it may have been with
glenfruin it is not fit that such irresponsible
justice should be executed on any man eu
less on a reverend churchman we shall
give orders to sift this matter and glenfruin
shall be made to account for what he has
donee 
his majesty then taking bishop wardle
aside while those who had come into the
 the paewife
presence with him were retiring informed
him that he was minded to found a house to
the glory god in the city perth and
commanded him to remain at scone until the
needful preparations were made
now it came to pass as they were discoursing
 this matter together that the
earl athos came into the chamber with
the petition sir robert gramme his
hand and went towards the king to present
it his majesty observing him said with his
freest urbanity
what great favour would our good uncle
that he comes to us with such elaboration
 homage this is something my lord
that you either fear will not be granted or
think should not with these words his
majesty took the paper from the earl but
when at the first glance he saw it was a petition
for the remission a punishment he
folded it up and said gravely
i am grieved my lord to refuse any
the spaewiffi 
solicitation preferred by you but the time
has not yet come when a recorded sentence
may be rescinded in scotland here have
just been the heads the church complaining
 what they still supper from the misrule
and tyranny those to whom power has been
unwisely delegated take back the paper
i have not even looked at the name the
petitioner
my gracious lieges exclaimed the
earl moving as if averse to receive the
petition
 i am not to be entreated in such things
sind the king severely i have told you
that till i have searched those evils to their
source which have made this unhappy kingdom
one constant theatre crime i shall
esteem myself even with all endeavour to the
contrary but as a candidate on probation for
the great office to which providence has called
me
 from whom is the petition said bishop
vol g

 the pawif
wardle apart for his majesty in so speaking
had turned away
from my kinsman sir robert grammes
do you my lord exclaimed the bishop
amazed to hear this do you petition fora
pardon to him 
the king having partly overheard the
bishops words turned quickly round and
said
who is the petitioner 
 a bold and dangerous mans replied the
earl scarcely aware what he said so
nmch had the sharp speech and keen look 
bishop wardle disturbed the resolution
wherewith he had prepared himself for the
interview
and for these qualities exclaimed his
majesty would you ask his pardon tell
me at once that he is the king scotland
and that we are but permitted to hold the
crown through his forbearance let me never
hear such words again eighteen years
this sbaswifr l
with time naoboe prisoner i was exiled firm
my rights and in that time crimes were au
lowed to grow to customs among youhow
am i aided in the endeavour to lessen such
misery wien great and good men like you
lord athos set yourselves forward as the
advocates bold and dangerous offenders
it chafes my very heart to think diet there is
never to be an to the habitude misrule
which has made the name the wild
scot a proverb for shame throughout christendom
but what is your friend called 
 he is no friend mines replied the
earl diffidently the petition is from sir
robert graeme
 sir robert gramme i have ever repented
the indulgence shown to that man it
haunts mess said the kg like the memory
 a foul deed in a troubled conscience it
comes upon my spirit at times like the fear
that is said to follow guilt and you my
lord who were so opposed to that indulges
the paewife
genoa how is it that you now would sue for
his pardon i hove no taint superstition
but such accidents seem almost portentous
bishop waidlaw who had stood surprised
to observe the king in this mood turned to
the earl and added
 it was an evil hour and under some malignant
planet when you ravelled yourself
with the knotted yam that bad mans destiny

the earl trembled and became pale and
could not for some time master the perturbation
into which he was thrown by these chiding

the king seeing his agitation softened
his voice and said to him in a soothing manner

 but i doubt not that in all things you
have ever considered what at the time was
best and though no good has come or can
come from the lenity shown to sir robert
gramme yet i do acquit you my lord all
the spaewife 
blame with respect to it not so however
with respect to this though to say truly
i know not well wherdbre and with as little
reason it is perhaps that i say i wirii you
had not mingled the honours and merits 
your own unblemished life with the devices
and crimes that stubborn traitors
 how is its said the earl composedly
 that while your majesty says my life has
been unblemished occasion is taken from the
case an unfortunate kinsman to subject me
to a degree reproof as if i had thyself in
some way offended my lord bishop here
is a pious and an honest man i should have
felt contrition could i have even in thought
questioned his integrity he is building a
fair and stately college at st andrews he
giants and attends mass not a priest the
church is more exemplary i have never
heard that the merits his virtues and endeavours
have laid him open to any suspicions

at the time neither my own mind nor the
judgment the wisest my council approved
for it went upon the notion that he
might become an honest man however to
say no more that as it is impossible fer
the king's arms long as they may be to

noblemen as are unquestionable fidelity
to rniir again to your several castles and
each with his own province emulate the
administration which we intend to exercise
in ours know you any thing a chieftain
in lennox called glenfr ruin 
 i have heard him replied the earl
 and it b said that he holds the unfortunate
duchess albany prisoner in order to
extort a ransom for her deliverance
 when did you hear this why was not i
sooner told exclaimed the king could
you come here to petition for a traitor like
sir robert gramme and know that so noble a
 the spaewife
lady was in the reverence sudbi a barbarian
 for nothing less can i account this gleq
ruin who out his own cieiprice committed
martyrdom on an innocent holy and blameless
friar you ought my lord to have
told me this first i will listen to no question
till orders are sent for the deliverance 
the duchess albany
 i beseech your majesty for one words
relied the earl glenfruin is a staunch
and true subject
 then let it be shown that he respects
justice justice which to the sacrifice my
own sentiments as a man i have so strenuously
endeavoured to revive i have my
lord not spared in that endeavour the
greatest and the most honoured jmy own
kinsmen and the principle that made me
bring them to the scaffold is not impaired
nor while retain that sense my royal
office with which i returned into this realm
will i allow it to suffer any occupations
the spaewife 
the earl though awed by the vehemence
 his majesty yet retained his selfpossession
and said
 it belongs not to me to execute whatever
may be your majestys pleasure upon glenruin
or upon any other df the untractable
chieftains but in my own country i shall not
be found wanting in my duty
 then go to your own country said the
king abruptly and see that it is so butin
a moment his majesty felt that he had
dealt hardly towards so venerable and esteemed
a person as the earl athos and he
added i would my lord that i could
endure these things more patiently but
good bishop warsaw here knows that the
manifold complaints with which i am beset
and they are all just gall my very spirit for
i am a young man and the old are too prone
to their own sordid intents to lend me that
true help by which alone i can hope to overcome
the difficulties wherewith my royal eiik

the earl without lacking mis ipaiwer
humbly retired and when he was gone the
ing said to bishop wardlaw
 i know not wherefore it is that i have
been so moved by this matter but the moment
that the earl presented yon piper i
felt as if an irresistible influence caused some
hidden antipathy my nature to awake
and i became as it were wroth towards hidai
not having any sufficient cause to be so for
after all what he dad waa but in christian
charity i pray that no liars ocne to liii
from sir robert gramme
 amen responded the bip fiofif
the ing however instead coiitiiog
thir sfabwifb 
the conversation moved thoughtfully towards
the door which led into his privychamber
but before going in he turned round and
said
 that business glenfruin and the monk
shall be speedily investigated i now remember
it was the'lady sibilla who told me something
 the affair but not as the prior has
stated it but truly i am more disturbed that
he should have dared to touch the duchess
than for the offence he has given to the church
but we shall know the truth without loss 
time for this very night i will summon him
before us
so saying his majesty withdrew and the
same evening a herald with horn and mantle
was sent to the castle glenfruin to bring
that chief before the king in council
 the paewife
chap xiv
when the lady sibilla heard that the king's
council had sent her father totimtauon she
supplicated the countess boss to retire
from the cqjirt to the which that lady was
the more inclined by the fieulure divers endeavours
on her part to obtain some remission
 the sentence entered against her brother
macdonald but though consent was readily
given by the queen to their retreat not
however without sorrow at parting with sibill
it was thought prudent by many the
council that these ladies should not at that
time be permitted to go cither into the north
or to the isles
this prudence proceeded from two causes 
first because the countess ross was vehemently
attached to her brother and so loudly
the spaewife 
makxmtent at the severity with which she
considered him treated in contempt as it
were the frankness his surrender and
homage to the king that it was feared she
might again stir up the rebellion whereof
though the flame was out the embers were
still alive and secondly on account the
bruit spread abroad that after the breaking
up the camp at inverness the lord james
had retired into the western highlands
where he was lurking for another opportunity
to molest the peace the kingdom and
where it was thought if the lady sibilla
went to her father's country she would from
the known spirit her character not fail to
do all in her power to forward the cause 
her betrothed lover accordingly instead 
being permitted to go either into the north or
to skye those disconsolate ladies had only
leave to retire from court to the nunnery 
inch coin in the faith forth where fora
time they remained in peaceful sequestration
 th spaewife
while those events were fair coming on in
the rehearsal whereof it is now expedient to
proceed with a free and fluent pen
the chivalrous horn which was heard at
the gate glenfruin when he so unwittingly
offended the dainty ears leddy gkn
jackie was the summons the herald sent
by the king to bring that chieftain to answer
for the charge preferred against him fer the
death father mungo and for holding the
duchess albany jmsoner
on seeing the approach the herald and
his retinue towards the castle the warders
according to custom on the appearance 
strangers had diet the gate and olenfruin
when he left the teddy with his daughters
went to the top the embattled wall over
die entrance to parley with the summoner
keith the herald in due form having declared
his office demanded admission a request
which the chieftain did not very well
know how to refuse but which somehow he
knew mot therefore he was not moth inclined
to grant he was not conscious having
done any thing to bring upon inn the royal
dtqdeasuee but what be bad heard trattk the
earl athos with respect to the dnciiesb
and the little encouragement that he had re
cared for seiiif sir robert oribnie male
him uneasy and apprehensive and these fe
isis led him to say without affecting to have
heard the demand admission

looking down at the men who were standing
in the gateway he gave them a gn to be in
no hurry and turning round to the herald
he said 
 aye and so yell pe with te sjngs order
and odmmeeshion and what will te order

the herald that was seen in this neighbourhood
about the time the burning 
dumbarton 
 ooh aye exclaimed the innocenthearted
glenfruin there came one o those tings till
us tat night put we kilt her
keith the herald looked aghast as did also
those who were his retinue at hearing the
stalwart chieftain speak in that manner the
martyrdom a churchman so they were
taught to believe the fate father mungo
had been and they wished that the gates
might not be opened glenfruin observing
the paswife 
that they were in some degree daunted
though he knew not the cause added
 an ish a toleisurely tat te kingi
herald will pe some for te caaz o fairer

herald mustering all his courage to answer
for the detention the noble duchess

 sowlls and bodies tar mi liudie toodle

a free my grot she's a bird in te air and a

on hearing that the duchess was in the
castle the herald's fears in some measure
abated and he became again a little more
peremptory in his accent
 so much the better it will be for you
glenfruin that her grace is but as your
guest said he however as my orders
b tfi ispaewife
are to esary yoa before his majesty where
you will explain these things to save all mv
ther trouble order the gates to be immediately
opened for if i am kept much longer
here i shall return at once and report you

 i demand admittance in the kings
mune cried the herald with a loud and sonorous
voice that startled the echoes around
and made the heart glenfruin quake
in the meantime the ladies within the
obstle had mounted to the battlements the
tower and standing there heard the latter part
h bfavwitb 
 this colloquy the chieftain peroeivingtbe
rifle be ru df being reported as a tmust 
the eings authority if he longer refused adamson
hastily turned round and ordered
his men in the court to open the gates at
the same tie casting his eyes towards the
battlements where the ladies were scandhig
and seeing leddy gknjuckie in order to
conceal his uneasiness be affected to be galinde
ftcetiou and said to her 
and kt a tobemireiy my good lai
lismdegs tat yeu pe were a pigeon dow
sowlls and bodies i took yon al tis die fora
wee winking witch o a hoolet
 yonreahobgdblinamafaoundr exclaimed
the indignant leddy glenjuckie and now
you shall know what it is to insult ladies
by this time the gate had been opened
and keith having come into the court the
castle heard the lady's complaint but gleni
ruin with a significant glance al his eye upwards
and touching at the same time his 
the paewife
head with his finger said intending by the
look and gesture to imply that die was not
in her right mind
 its a sore och hon poor old cat des
feedencies
nor was his insinuation illtimed for at
that moment ledd glenjuckie uttered a
shrill and strange shriek partly joy and
partly amazement and the duchess who
was then at some distance on the battlements
apart was so surprised thereat that die rushed
towards her in alarm waving at the same
time her hand towards two strangers who
were seen ascending the castlehill from the
side opposite to that by which the herald with
his retinue had come
m the stem justice the king
will be conceded to the affection a kinsman
for succouring a poor fugitive butwhether
it may be so or not i will perform
the task i baye uodtiken and let hereafter
provide for the isaue
 but bring him not back to this houses
the pabwifb 
replied the lady the power your ta
there's vassals is such that the king may well
be jealous were he to hear his bdoig with
us for to keep hip openly in kikhtim would
be to contemn the royal edicts and to conceal
him among us would betray a secret affection
for his fortunes that ychirfeither could
not easily extenuate even in so far as affected
himself notwithstanding his long and tried
devotion to the king
 thei said celeine with a sigh he
has nothing to hope tor in scotland i found
him on the utmost verge adversity he
was then minded to pass to the isle rhodes 
and in submission to his ill fate and the faithless
inconstancy the daughter macdonald
he purposed to seek admission into the
order st john i cheered the despak 
that resolution with the assurance that so
dark an hour as then blackened ove him
could not be far from the midnight his
misfortunes but if the dan campbell pay
 the paewife
not or dare not give shelter to a poor stranger
who has not where to lay his head thor
answer not to the opinion i would hold 
thir hospitality for it i entertainment only
as a guest that i pledged myself to bestow
nor would i be so disloyal to my father as to
tamper with the fidelity his vassals knowing
as i do how freely he has undertaken to
the king to maintain good order and fealty
among them but not to debate when i
should be doing i will follow the lord
james to irishail and concert with him
what in this extremity should be donee
so saying he parted from the lady and
went to the creek below the castle where the
boat was lying where his two younger bros
 
tiers had been sailing and stepping on board
called to humour young menby namewho were
reclining on the banks the lake listening to
the harpings an aged bard who was rehearsing
to them the song sera and the
thrush which sings mellowest at the going
the spaewife 
down the sun ever and anon from amidst
the boughs a neighbouring tree sent forth
to them her sweet symphony in melodies not
more artless for it was then the close the
day and all things around seemed composed
to harmony and rest
on the noithem side the hills and woody
skirts the lake were darkened with their
own shadows and hung over the clear depths
 the stillness the sleeping waters below
wherein the glories the evening sky lay
reflected as if they had been clouds enviously
drawn between the world and some marvellous
apocalypse brightness and beauty
but on the southern shore the green hills
with their rocks and cliffs tufted with trees
and hazel the rugged ravines where the silvery
waterfalls here and there glance out
upon the brighter scene and the mountainash
that holds up his ruby berries amidst the
fading woods and the falling leaves like a
young hero who has dyed his sword for the
vol h
 the spaewife
first time in the good some renowned
warrior were all still uttering tq the setting
sun and the islets on the bosom the
lake seemed like argosies in a calm white
from the tower macnaughton on fraoch
plain the smoke the evening hearth
streamed afar through the serene air ike the
wreath the sounding galley that is yet
destined to waken the slumbering waters and
the silent echoes loch aw the loneliest
and the loveliest all the highland lakes in
the st'dl ah autumnal evening such as that
cm which the young chief the campbellss
embarked with his four clansmen to follow the
lord james and father donich to the chantry
on irishail
thinking they had taken the road along
the banks the lake he had leapt into the
boat and ordered the men to ply their oars
vigorously that he might reach the island before
them but after his arrival there and
having waited long patiently expecting their
the sfaswibe 
comh he began to fear that surely some
mischance had befallen them s reluctant
to return home until he was in some way satisfied
he sent two the clansmen to search
for them their search however was fruitless
and about midnight when they came
back without tidings he returned to kil
chum where his lady mother was no less
disturbed than himself with fears and anxieties
for their safety
the first thought that came both to her
mind and to his was to send out servants in
all directions to search the hills and to gather
intelligence wheresoever it was likely to be
obtained but when they considered the wonderment
that such solicitude would cause
throughout the country and the danger that
might thereby arise to the fugitive they consulted
together and it was agreed between
them that celestine with a numerous trfdn
under the pretext hunting should by break
 day make towards lemkik luther in
s the spaewsfe
the course the journey from inverness to
cilchurn the lord james had often spoke
 going to raise among the friends his mother's
family the means bidding adieu to
scotland for ever
father donich however instead keeping
the regular road being well acquainted with
the mountainpaths and unfrequented tracks
conducted his charge by a different course to
that which celestine took who passed through
glencoe and reached loch long head before
he heard any tidings his friends it was
not indeed until he had claimed entertainment
from macfarlane in the castle arrow
on the second night after his departure
from home that he obtained any information
to guide his search
it chanced on that night as he was sitting
at supper discoursing with macfarlane his
exploits as a hunter that he recounted to
him how in returning from his late excursion
beyond ben clachan he had fallen in with
the spaewife 
sir aulay macaulay for the macfarlane
notwithstanding the insinuations glenfruin
to the contrary happened then to be one 
the most orderly and loyal all the western
chieftains and on that account celestine did
not choose to tell him that he had been even
so far as loch rannochside whether there
was any thing particular in the sound his
voice or in his look when he spoke this v
adventure it was certainly not renuurked either
by macfarlane himself nor by any the
kinsmen then seated at the table with them 
but while he was speaking he was startled by
the apparition two bright and glittering
eyes shining in an obscure comer in the hal
over against him and in a moment after the
voice the spaewife was heard chanting
from the same plaoe
 sir aulay macaulay the laid cairndhue
bailie dumbarton and provost the blue
 o never mind her said macfarlane 
 the paewfe
 it is that poor traders creature aianiple
 domblane she came into the hall a short
time before yourself they say ie knows
something by common but whether it be so
or not es a harmless thing and is ay free
 a night s lodging here
 aye interposed anniple dragging herself
forward without rising it's well known
that i kea something
 sir aulay maeanbf the laird ef cumdhue
bailie dumbarton and provost the hue
 well said celestine and what know
yon him have you seen him lately 
how was it with him 
she however made no answer but sang
 stranger whatsoever rank
or degree be admitted without my orders 
save only the king himselfe
many vassals and retainers were then
standing around in that ward the castle
 
 the spaewife
and heard what he said they had before
learnt how stuart had left the court in anger
and they remembered the doom duke
murdoch and his sons with concern alit silence
when they saw how much their own
aged master was chafed and troubled for
the earl athos had ever been the most
kind lords and was much beloved by all
bound to his servitude whether by tenure or
fee
after he had even that order to guard
the gate so vigilantly he went leaning on his
nephew into the hall where he said to him
with some degree tremor in his voice
 i would see sir robert gramme send
him to me
stuart made no reply but with buoyant
steps went to the tower where xrssme was
held seemingly in the strictest custody and
bade him come to the earl no words passed
between them but they exchanged looks pregnant
with a mutual understanding each
the spaewife 
others thoughts the fruit their communion
and intercourse during the absence the
earl
on reaching the chamber where the earl
was alone they found him pacing the floor
with wide strides his eyes were bent upon
the ground his brows knotted with cogitation
and he walked with his hands behind
the left firmly grasping his right arm by the
west
he observed them come in together and
without appearing to notice gramme he signified
to his nephew with a look and a brief
and abrupt wave his hand that he wished
him to retire stuart immediately withdrew
to the outside oithe door which gramme held
half open
it was your pleasure my lord said
grammes after a short pause to send for
me
 i have been insulted on your account sir
robert grammes said the earl your petits
the spaewife
tion has been rejected with scorn i have endured
unexampled contumely
gramme smiled and without changing his
position but only taking his hand from the
door which he emphatically closed saide
when you are king will you eve me
back my lands 
 sir robert gramme what do you mean 
exclaimed the earl pausing and looking steadfastly
at him
 the man replied gramme that has so
insulted you is my enemy the common oppressor
 every freeman in the realm our
causes are now joined my life which is a
trifle that i have often hazarded i have
sworn to give for revenge it is all i have
to give in a word my lord my heart and
my dagger are alike thirsty but they are epicures
and will not be satisfied with less than
royal blood
hush hush sir robert grammes cried
the earl going hastily towards him
the spaewife ribs
 i am calin replied gramme i ask a
simple questiongire me a plain answer
will you restore my lands if you are made
kings
 surely said the earl the wild condition
to which you have been condemned must
have impaired your wonted discretion you
have so long lived a banished man been
housed in caves and in fellowship with savage
beasts that surely you have lost all reckoning
with the world have you not heard that
the queen was lately delivered two princes
and though one died the other thrives well 
a lively and promising prince 
my lord said gramme in this your
own castle within these your own walls and
beyond all chance escape save with you
consent you hear me openly propose treat
am i not arrested is it not because
you like the proposition between you
and the thronethe baby i count as nothing
stood duke murdoch and his sons thanks
 the paewife
to that justice which has no respect for kith
or kin they are rnoved
your words your purposes appal me
like the prophecies an oracle i may not
listen to such things exclaimed the earl
 but you are a banished and an oppressed
man and i can pity you
will you assist me 
 in what would you have my assistance 
have i not carried your petition to the king 
have i not been all but spurned for presenting
it
 well wellbut will you help me to redress
yours and my own wrongs 
how 
why my lord need you so much
explanation briefly then if i master
the tyrant and place you in his seat will
you reverse the sentence under which i
suffer 
sir robert gramme it is easy to promise
much but the chances my ever being callthe
spaewife 
ed to the performance is now hopeless have 
i not told you the prince 
how very merciful in such a business as
this to think a helpless and harmless
baby
the earl finding himself as it were overpowered
by the demon who so openly tempted
him replied slowly and hesitatingly
be not so headstrong let me have time
to consider what you would undertake 
the hazards the risks the failure the
guilt the success the long preparations
the horrible death
gramme after a momentary pause said
 as to heads stuck on pikes over the city
gate and limbs tainting the air from the four
quarters the kingdom i shudder but with
the thought the vile moralities worse than
maggots which such things engender among
buts and clowns as they drive their sheep and
kine to market my lord if my honesty offends
you let me go forth from the castle you
 the spaewifk
may permit so much to be done to help yoa
to the throne you do not bid me go the
worst thing that can befall us is but to die 
and when that which is the man hath quitted
the clay let the carcass rot do the cooks
and carvers in your hall inflict anguish in
their vocations and if we are destined to
die the death traitors will the afterward
 the hangman make us feel more 
 these peals terror may amuse your
fancy sir robert grammes replied the earl
firmly and with something his accustomed
lordliness but i have all my life been a
man averse to blood nor do i see that to regain
my natural rights so wrongfully abrogated
there is any necessity to take the emg's
life had we his person in our power here
or could by any device carry him off from
the midst his government i would ask
no more nor to more will i lend myself
if even to so much when i may have fted
the risks the matter more thoroughly
the spaewife 
 my lord sind grseme with undaunted
coolness it is plain to me that this is not
the first time you have thought this matter
i doubt not you have long considered it
well
to slay the king replied the earl dismayed
by his familiar boldness is a crime
to which i can never be consenting but i
have a tower that stands far in the sea upon
a steep and almost inaccessible rocking sail
is ever seen from its narrow windows by the
melancholy warders save the solitary ferryboat
in the summer calms or in the wintry
mornings after a tempest some unfortunate
vessel with her crew all dead clinging and
frozen to the rigging
 the safest prison for a king replied
gramme with a sneer is the grave there is
no key bolt nor jailor that can be safely
trusted with such a charge but the spade
i will never cried the earl stain my
hands with blood
 the spaewife
a
very well let it be so replied gramme 
 there are apothecaries and skilful cooks 
cannot you procure leave for one to spice his
majesty's supper but no that will not do 
i should thereby not satisfy my revenge i
must feel his blood and have sensation its
warmth r
 he has never injured me said the earl
mournfully
 i do not expect cried gramme impatiently
 that you with your own hands will use
the knife i would but have you privy to the
design that i may know what shall betide
me if we succeed
the earl wildly clasped his hands and
with a sad and piercing voice exclaimed
oh i am as one that swims in a river
and feels the force some great cataract
drawing him down louder and louder rises
the roaring the fall
gramme laughed
but the good angel the earl was then
the spaewife 
contending with the fiend and the ambitious
miserable poor infirm greyhaired old man
rushed in horror from the room
 the spaewife

glenfruin having in the meantime exhausted
all his blandishments in the hope inducing
the herald to forego the execution his
warrant had at last recourse to expostulation
and began to doubt if it was possible that he
could be summoned before the king and council
to answer any accusation to this however
keith replied by reading the summons
wherein it was rehearsed that his majesty
greeting and so forth required aid commanded
him to appear

and isn't not a shame and a fye tat te king

keith felt somewhat uneasy at the contumacious
spirit which glenfruin was again beginning
to manifest and glancing anxiously
around saving his own three attendants and
 the spaewife
father donich he beheld only hempenhaired
vassals and shaggy somers that questioned
no hest their chieftain mustering from
without and standing row behind row to
the utmost obscurity the hall their fierce
eyes glaring like red and ominous stars
through the gloom the night still not
altogether daunted he saide

that you will be able to prove it so to the

in an instant the three attendants and the
terrified herald were seized and lifted upon
the shoulders the clansmen but father
donich who had hitherto remained a silent
spectator ran to the chieftain who was
grumbling like an earthquake his gathering
wrath being no longer repressibleand laying
his hand on his shoulder said 
for goodness and mercy glenfruin be
not so rash surely you will not hang them 
och put she will every mother's son o

at glenfruins gate hung a crooked and
sonorous piece iron which when none 
the warders chanced to be at hand visitors
desiring admittance struck against the wall
and inde it thereby send forth a loud and
longreverberating sound at this crisis all
the clansmen and sinners being in the hall
the sound the iron was heard and with
such a peal as announced no ordinary visitor

glenfruin looked as if in doubt whether it
was the iron he had heard father donich
stood aghast terrified by his blasphemy the
clansmen who had lifted the herald and his
men on their shoulders and were moving
away halted and looked back for instruct
tons and for the space about a minute
there was a pause and silence in the hall
 th spabwife
the iron was gmn sounded more loudly
thflh before laads said oleafruin yeli
lay te kings herald and his men on were foots
and see wha will pe coming wi a bang and a
boon like tat oomph
 it was celestine campbell with his train
led thither by anniple and as at that time
loch a ws clan and glenfruins were at peace
with one another he was readily admitted
but no sooner was he come into the hall than
the herald demanded his aid and protection
in the kings name which after a brief explanation
 what had passed the young
chieftain to the great amaze and consternation
 glenfruin at once promised
 sowlls and bodies said he and if tis
be te laws and te justice a chief's put a fe
lonee
celestine however having assured him that
the king always dealt clement with those
who willingly obeyed us authority persisted
him to submit peaceably to the herald and
the spaewife 
keith having promised to make no complaint
 his discourteous treatment he in
the not only consented to desist from all
farther opposition but promised that he would
next morning freely go to perth where the
summons required him to appear
meanwhile celestine observing father dorich
in the hall was much afflicted in mind
thinking the lord james was also in the castle
and that he might be discovered by the
herald at the same time knowing that
glenfruin had not engaged in the lennoxshire
rebellion and was considered adverse to
the albanies he thought to a surety if he was
there he must have come under his assumed
name accordingly after some light and preliminary
overtures which served to instruct
father donich what he meant without being
understood by those around he inquired
if he had seen any thing sir aulay macaulay
in the course the journey
glesifiruin raised his ear and looking a
 the spaewife
stance with his eye eagerly watched the answer

 i parted from him replied father dorich
 at the foot the hill he spoke 
crossing the moors to his own castle at ardennaples

sowus and bodies exclaimed glenfruin
and isn't a toleisurely that sir aulay macaulay
would pe a todjowrie among te lambs

get your swords and your bows al every mother's

in a few minutes all the clansmen with
nigel at their head were ready
 what do you mean exclaimed the
young chieftain loch aw alarmed at their
alacrity what is that you would do are
you not friends with the macaulays surely
you will not molest a defenceless hunter

celestine was still more distressed and perplexed
by this information so portentous to
the safety his illfated cousin but father
donich perceiving his inward grief said
then glenfruin you know sir aulay
macaulay 
will we no have a head in our eye to
know te macaulay lands i nigel you snail

let us consider what may be the consequence
if sir aulay has made his peace with the
king it will only aggravate the offence wherewith
you are accused if you attempt to molest
him
 sowus and bodies is na he a bird on
te hills a cock o te wood tat has na a nest
for his foot te toad's on te hearth in his hal
here the herald interposed and said that
certainly sir aulay macaulay had not made
his submission and that glenfruin perhaps
could do nothing more acceptable than to
bring him in
perhaps said father donich i may
have been in error and on second thoughts
it is not likely that he would have ventured so
near the castle such a loyal chieftain as
glenfruin
tat's a speech like a wisdom faider
donich glenfruin's te loyal man and te
honest man too put lands see wha will pe

 te lord hamies faider donich would

 o he does not mean to say that you had
any correspondence with him cried celestina
briskly perceiving the drift the chiefs
tain's question but only asks if you know
him by sight
 he mil have a horn and a tail and
a hoof for glenfruin
celestina divined from this answer that
glenfiruin had never seen the person i the
lord james and perceived that the only risk
hejcaa discovery in being brout into the
castle woa from the herald he tfaenefone ret
tolvfid to prevent him from coming in by
gbixig ia march him accordingly leave
 the spaewife
ing father donich with keith and 
and taking out nigel whose simple air
and prepossessing physiognomy had drawn
his attention he left the hall attended by
only his own clansmen
meanwhile the duchess from the moment
she had discovered her son from the battlement
was overwhelmed with fears and feelings
to which she could give no utterance nor withall
her fortitude conceal fain would she have
rushed to him but the dread endangering
his safety repressed her maternal love eager
she was to let him know her being there
that they might exchange though afar off
some little signal sympathy but the arrival
 celestine campbell sharpened her
anxieties for though she recognised in him
a kinsman by his garb his appearance so immediately
after the herald seemed to augur
no consolation to her his father being as she
well knew one the firmest adversaries 
the albanies daring the long controversy in
the spaewife 
the hall her wishes and affections however
so far overcame her fears that she resolved to
send her gentlewoman to request him to come
to her that she might learn what his visit
portended and it happened that as he
quitted the hall the aged lady came downstairs
and passed towards the door after
him glenfruin seeing her said something
that he intended to be jocose and gallant but
she tartly glanced'at him over her shoulder
and walked loftily away

as soon as celestine campbell had passed
beyond the threshold the hall seeing his
own clansmen around and none the glenfruits
nigh he addressed himself to nigel
saying 
 in these times one knows not well what
course to take your father has ever been
reputed a leal and true subject mine as
such no one can doubt and yet to deal
frankly with you being half an albany by
my mother my heart does not altogether
lie to my father's policy if that can be called
craft which in him i doubt not is the fruit
 honesty
 i did think said nigel won by the
openness his companion that there
could be no higher duty than that obedience
to the king not for the advantage
the spaewife 
that might thence arise though my father
considered the eings cause ever the most
advantageous service butand he hesitated
fearing he might have said too much for he
was an artless youth and his affections easily
governed by the admiration his eye or the
flattery his ear albeit he lacked not a just
discernment what was true and kind
but what replied celestine what
would you have said i trust you may speak
freely to me i have told you how much i
am myself an albany and i will say more
to you for i do esteem you by your face asa
friend though i would pause to consider
whether i should in any way or form assist
the cause my cousin the lord james
yet i would not for all the forfeitures that
the crown has gained by the fate my kinsmen
betn or injure the basest or the most
lukewarm his followers
 i meant but to hate observed said
nigel that after seeing die sad plight into
 the spaewife
which so sweet and so fair a maiden as the
lady sibilla macdonald was cast on the
night the burning dumbarton and the
majestical sorrow the duchess albany
since that i can think no more the kings
authority but only the anguish spirit
and the broken hearts which his terrible justice
has made yet will i at no man's solicitation
go against his majesty for those sufferings
and griefs come more the misrule
 times past than from any cruelty in that
which he so strives to establish and fortify as
law
 then you would not said celestine
 surrender even the lord james himself
were he by any accident thrown into your
power 
 i could hold my hand in the fire till it is
burnt to the stumps replied the courageous
youth proudly and it is not much to say
i may withstand iny temptation that would
make me despise myself
the spaewife 
if this stranger thence said celestine
should prove to be indeed sir aulay macaulay
will you not take him on your father's
account seeing as the herald says it would
weigh much in his favour with the king 
if we take him in the pursuit i will
hold him as a fair prisoner he has not
trusted me he has no claim on my promise
 and i shall not therefore do any wrong
treat him as i may if not discourteously
should he ever come into my hands
let us be friends said celestine in
whatsoever you trust me with i shall be
faithful be you so with me i have some
cause to believe that this stranger is no other
than my distressed cousin he is now in
your power you have but to return to the
hall and to repeat what i have said and ina
few minutes your clansmen wil make him
yours your father will then be able to
carry with him one worth twenty sir aulay
macaulayss a ransom indeed that will re
 the spaewifb
deem him from the displeasure the king
were it ten times greater than it is
the young chieftain looked doubtingly
at celestine surely said he i am
not so soon called to such honour as to be
trusted with the life and fortunes that
noble prince who may one day be my
king 
 you have it in your power replied
celestine to insure your father's pardon
 if the king be that just man which he
is said to be replied nigel he will not be
bribed to pardon my father should he be
found to have offended
 but at least you may increase your
lands
when you offered to me your friendship
celestine campbell said the simple
and enthusiastic youth i was afraid that
i was not worthy so great an honour
but you make me almost doubt if you be
worthy mine
the spaewife 
destine smiled for a moment at his romantic
ardour but the simple air and mountain
garb nigel the calm and mild enthusiasm
 his countenance beaming like radiance
from within changed his feelings to a
higher mood and the tear admiration
shot into his eye but the young chieftain
wanted words to express what he felt in return
for the feelings that he had awakened
in celestine and he turned away to hide the
contrition which he suffered for having spoken
so proudly to so generous a friend
at that moment leddy glenjuckie who
had tottered after them as fast as her sciatica
would permit called to celestine and on
his going towards her she told him the message
from the duchess he had not before
heard that her grace was in the castle and
he stood amazed nigel while they were
speaking joined them and seeing his wonderment
rehearsed in what manner his father
had seized the duchess
 the spaewife
i will leave your said celestine to discover
the stranger and will instantly attend
her grace but the old lady uttered a piercing
shriek at the idea the lord james
falling into the hands the glenfruins controlling
however her terror in a moment
she pretended that it was the anguish her
sciatica only which caused her to cry and
celestine left her and went back to the castle
as soon as he was gone she began to speak
loudly and shrill in the hope that if the
lord james heard her as she was then near
the underwood into which he had dived on
being left by father donich it would put
him on his guard complaining at the same
time bitterly to nigel the insults which
she had endured from his father
her stratagem so far succeeded that the
outlaw who had overheard in his concealment
part what passed between celestine
and nigel recognising her voice suddenly
appeared before them
the spaewife 
danger and adversity are quick teachers 
expedients the outlaw knew he wa in the
utmost peril discovery and before the
leddy glenjuckie had time to fetch her
breath from the astonishment into which he
had thrown her he told her that they must
exchange clothes to this proposition so
unseemly to her courtly manners she could
only lift her hands and look her horror
nigel said but two words to celestina clansmen
and on the instant one them with all
that romantic delicacy towards the gentle sex
for which the celts in those days were renowned
stuffed a plaid into her mouth and
held her fast while his companions stripped
her almost to the skin the lord james
in the meantime doffed his upper habiliments
and putting on her feminine and fantastical
gear the highlanders dressed her in his
clothes
nothing from the time her misfortune
has equalled this but the lord james to
 the spaewifb

whom she bore the affection a nurse having
often fondled him when a baby in her
arms and nigel who had ingratiated himself
into her favour by the respectful modesty
 his demeanour soon succeeded in calming
her perturbation and in reconciling her to
the metamorphosis nor was it long till
they had occasion to applaud the charity 
the change for even while they were soothing
her with their best persuasion glenfruin
himself accompanied by the herald and father
donich came forth from the castlegate
to taste the freshness the evening air before
supper and to see what success had attended
the search for the stranger
as soon as nigel saw his father he weojt
towards him to prevent him from coming so
near as to discover what had taken place
and told him pointing to the leddy in the
garb the lord james that he would see it
was not the macaulay
glenfruin required no instructor as to that 
the spawif si 
but observing the lcnrd james moving rapidly
in the dress the lady down the hill
he exclaimed
sowlls and bodies ist a bost or
weezzard will te old cat pe coing to die 
and will yon pe her wraith te spirits no
hae te pains in te pack oomph nigel
i say nigel will ye no pe seeing yon troll
ostentation sowlls and bodies we're al a
fear and a quake
father donich had also noticed the phenomenon
and while glenfruin was speaking
he went so near to the lady as to discover the
transformation but being no less anxious
than nigel to conceal what had happened
he hastily returned just as the fugitive disappeared
among the underwood and said
with great solemnity 
 it is a very awful apparition i doubt
not we shall hear news this hereafter it
betokens no good to the one who saw it first
i hope glenfruin it was not you 
 the spaewife

i hope it was yourself faider donich
replied the chieftain tuning sharply away
from him malcontent that such an ominous
question should have been put to him in his
circumstances
what think you it was said the father
donich in a superstitious manner to the
herald
what it is replied keith'drily some
varlet in the old lady's apparel but it does
not concern me
glenfruin hearing this halted and looked
back

the spaewife 
teddy not accustomed to walk in trews in endeavouring
to turn round happened to stumble
by which she gave her sciatica such a
wrench that she screamed with pain and
almost fell to the ground
sowlls and bodies exclaimed glenruin
 we're al in a dream and a version 
is it te laddie madam herself and advancing
towards her he took her by the arm
and turned her round saying and she pe
no have a petticoat at al oomph tis is a

another word he walked with wide and stem
strides towards the castlegate followed by all
those who were then on the castleshill

ik returning to the gate keith the herald
lingered behind with leddy glenjuckie ans
from time to time narrowly examined her
garb he however made no remark but
when they reached the castle he followed
glenfruin into the hall and sat down at the
table at the upper seemingly thoughtful
and mundi troubled
king's herald said glenfruin taking
his own seat well pe making a terroriga
tion when te old laddie madam will pe coming

i think replied keith it is quite unnecessary
to affect any concealment the
best thing you can now do for your own

the din and dissonance his cries ibid
the rattling the weapons wherewith the
clansmen and somers began to arm themselves
alarmed the whdie castle and brought
down destine campbell from the duchess 
while father domo assisting in the metamorphosed
leddy glenjuckie at the same
time entered the hall from without
celestine suspected the extent the discovery
that had been made and divined the object
oi the uproar and the arming he perceived
that his unfortunate kinsman would not fail
to be presently taken and that nothing buta
bold stratagem could avert the fate which
would inevitably await him
 glenfruin he exclaimed aloud and
with a voice so tuned to authority that it
instantly silenced the noise glenfruin i
am grieved to say that the fealty i owe to the
 the space wife
king compels me to deal with seeming harshness
towards you the herald has failed in
his duty by consenting to remain even for an
hour here the manner in which you have
seized the duchess albany and continue
to hold her as your prisoner though with a
show liberty is an offence that can admit
 no extenuation keith unless he consent
to go with you at once you must be responsible
for the consequences i have pledged
myself to support your authority i now
tell you that as a prisoner it is not safe to let
him remain here and i know not how i may
excuse to my father the jeopardy into which i
have led so many his bravest men
glenfruin looked for some time as if he
felt the world tumbling into pieces around
him and then he turned to keith and saide
herald and what will glenfruin
pe doing 
i have indeed done wrongs replied
keith glad any pretext to get away from
the spaewife 
the castle and to carry his prisoner with
him and i now call upon celestine campbell
to conduct us in safety to dumbarton
sowus and bodies and will ye pe leaving
te lord jeiamies tat is te traitor man al in
his patentee 
the lord james what him cried
celetsine almost afraid to hear the answer
there is some cause replied keith to
suspect that he is lurking in this neighbourhood
 and it is plain he added aside notwithstanding
all glenfruin's artifice that he
is in the secret that old lady is in a dress
which from the ornaments i know to be the
outlaw's i doubt not that the exchange was
made to enable him to escape for she is one
 his mother's attendants
 if that be the case said celestine
the story her grace's detention has been
concerted between her and glenfruin to conceal
their secret treasons nothing is more
likely than that my guilty cousin should
 the spaewifs
be near his mother whose influence in this
country has probably been rather increased
than lessened by the misfortunes her 

 sowlls and bodies will tis pe glenfruin's

 i have met with nothing like thisbe said
the herald to celestine but i was warned
 his depth and cunning
o i replied celestine aloud it is all
quite evident nigel his son is gone to warn
the outlaw this discovery
glenfruin sat down in his seat and began
to touch the table and to pinch his flesh and
to half unsheathed his dirk as if to ascertain
ths reality the scene and his own identity
 do you go with me p said the herald to
him after a short pause
 and will ye pe pelzeepub weevil and tis

the spar wife s
 that appearances are too strong against you
my old friend unhappy that i am to be

necessity making a prisoner my own
kinsman but if the lord james be seized
he must be taken with you
 glenfruin said the herald to celestine
 affects to be ignorant the lord james being
in this neighbourhood i hope he speaks
trulybut if he is here and here taken it
will go bard with glenfruin for how will hebe
able to explain so strange a thing here
is the duchess in circumstances so singular
that it was thought by all who heard her
situation that she was held by constraint
but there is now reason to believe that her
outlawed son is also here and that on seeing
a force appear to aid the kings authority he
changed his dress with one her ladies the
better to facilitate his escape in that juncture
the son and heir glenfruin is seen
 the spaewife
speaking with the fugitive and suffers him to
depart
celestine campbell looked at the amazed
and confounded chieftain and mournfully
shook his head
 sowlls and bodies l exclaimed glenfru
in with the sad accent helplessness and
will tis pe what you cal laa but lands 
he continued rising and moving towards the
door glenfruin will pete honest man
curse tak me put he will and we'll no have a
campbellnor te small toe a campbell to
mak him a custodes but we'll pe going our
own sylph and for a conger to te king's
herald come twenty pretty mans te flower
o you al for tis night we will pe a free will
in dumbarton when will king's herald
pe ready to go o isn't an ochhon and a
shame and a fye too oomph
glenfruin was conscious his own innocence
with respect to the lord james nor
was he at all sensible that he had committed
the spaewife 
any great wrong towards the duchess albany
whom he had hitherto considered asunder
the cloud the king's displeasure
with regard to sir robert gramme he still
thought notwithstanding the earl athos's
coldness that he had done some notable service
 and he considered that both for his abstinence
in the lennoxshire rebellion and the
alacrity with which he had obeyed the proclamation
to march against macdonald he
stood in no peril much suffering at
the same time he felt himself so environed
with such an array questionable circumstances
that he wot not well what to do
and therefore it was that in utter inability to
comprehend the situation into which he was
thrown by so many casualties he resolved at
once to go with the herald accordingly
after again expressing his wonder with some
degree sharpness at the absence his son
who had in all this time not returned into the
hall he said to celestine campbell
k
 the paewifje
yell tak your men al before you celestina
campbell and ye'll pe going away cas
you see celestine campbell you see tat were
will no pe a face on a nose coming into tis hal
till we our own sylph pe coming pack wt a
glorification
the reasonableness this request could
not well be controverted so celestine without
farther parley went out from the castle
followed by his clansmen and apparently with
the design going to the colquhoun less
for the night he parted with glenfruin on
the castlehill whence with the herald and
accompanied by twenty his own clanaoien
the chieftain was conducted to the road leading
to dumbarton
the spaewife 
chap xx
the earl athos was in the meantime
greatly disturbed in his thoughts by reason
chiefly the freedom wherewith sir robert
grime in the intrepidity his revenge had
proposed to undertake the assassination the
king he had not however virtue to withstand
temptation nor courage enough if so
good a name may be given to so bad a purpose
to embark openly in the avowed treason
 neither had he the firmness to lay such
an interact on the resentment by which his
nephew was borne away from his fealty as to
prevent him from surrendering himself up to
the machinations the traitor still the desire
not to part with the honour he enjoyed
was so lively within his heart that the same
night after gramme had so fearfully informs
the specified
him his regicide determination he or 
tered him to be sent forth from the castle
and never again to present himself at the
gates
gramme so little heeded this command
which was delivered to him by stuart that
before going away he indited a paper in
which he set forth his determination never to
desist from his hostility against the king
till he had vindicated his wrongs and satisfied
his revenge
give it said he to the earl and
we shall see what the bravery his loyalty
will do after so open a proclamation tress
son
stuart however did not that night deliver
the paper but conducted gramme to the gate
where in the hearing many the vassals
be bade him adieu bitterly grieving that the
king should so little esteem such a courageous
soldier as to drive him forth into the wild
woods and so despite fully repulse the pitying
the spaewife 
friends that petitioned only for some mitigation
in the rigour his punishment
to this condolence the outlaw made no reply
but that an avenging hour was coining
when perhaps even the ei athos would
repent having so far lent himself to the
cruelty the king
the earl replied stuart is not so
much your enemy as you think in banishing
you from his house i believe he acts
from the compulsion duty and the dread
 danger to himself for even he is no longer
safe
 what do you mean said gramme what
danger does he dread and why is it that you
account him no longer safe 
 he endured replied stuart yesterday
such insult merely because he presented
your humble petition that the king cannot
bit know as a man that he must suffer under
it and will tremble lest as a man he should
revenge it
 the spaewife
the vassals hearing then discoursing thus
openly the grievances which their lord
had endured gathered around and the taint
 sedition soon infected them all but the
overthrow an anointed king whose power
was beginning to be everywhere obeyed and
the genial shade whose protecting government
afforded asylum and refuge to all
his wronged and longidicted subjects was
an enterprise not to be hastily undertaken
in this manner however the crafty policy
which gramme had breathed into the spirit 
stuart was made to take effect and the vassals
 the earl athos were corrupted from
their loyalty even before he was himself entirely
subdued
in the morning stuart went forth from
the castleagate and at a short distance therefrom
affected to find on the grass the defiance
which gramme had penned he immediately
returned and began to question the
warders concerning it and he read it aloud
the spaewipe 
to them deploring the doom that had worked
so brave a spirit into such frantic ecstasy
he then carried it to the earl and eagerly
watched his looks as he read but though
the fated old man grew pale and his hands
trembled he made no remark he looked
not however at stuart but turned away his
face as if he had something to hide from the
piercing inquisition his eyes
three several times did stuart endeavour
to draw him into discourse concerning the
paper but he made him no answer he
held it however still in his hand sometimes
he looked at it and at others laid it down on
the table and walked to and fro communing
with himself
stuart waited with silence and patience to
see the issue this secret controversy and
was awed and confounded when after a season
the earl called one his trustiest officers
and bade him ride forthwith to the king
at scone with the rebellious proclamation
 the spaewife
and to assure his majesty that no means
should be left untried by him to bring in
the traitor
scarcely had this messenger departed on
his journey when kindly letters to the earl
came from the king wherein his majesty
described the great contrition which he suffered
at having so hastily parted with him 
and praying him by the name hisjkind
friend and true uncle to come back to assist
in the solemnity laying the foundation
 the stately abbey which he was minded to
build at perth he also entreated him to
bring stuart with him and said many gracious
things all meant to appease the sense 
the heat wherewith he had expressed himself
for so espousing the cause sir robert
gramme
when the earl read these courteous letters
to stuart that vindictive youth exclaimed
i will never again revisit the courts but
to
the spaewife 
the look which the earl gave him stopped
what he would have said and he retired
abashed and overawed when he beheld the
tears shoot into the old mans eye as he read
the letters a second time
it cannot be said the momentary penitent
 that any wrong can come from me
to so good and so generous a heart and
he added emphatically i beseech you my
dearest nephew to hold no correspondence
nor communion with sir robert gramme
let us return to the court and with such an
exhibition as befits our birth and the high
ceremony which the king intends to hold
forget the countenance that we have both
unfortunately for ourselves given in this
house to that implacable adversary all that
is good and fair in the princely nature our
royal kinsman
stuart again made another attempt to revert
to the contumely with which he conceived
the king had treated him and to pray
 the spaewife
that his presence might be dispensed with
but the earl was peremptory i am not
safe heres said he with a sigh neither 
us are safe in this place
 by whom are we endangered cried
stuart proudly
by ourselves replied the old man and
he turned aside his face and retired from the
room with slow and thoughtful steps
hitherto the indignation with which stuart
had received the king's innocent jocularity
made him see nothing but justice and the vindication
 wrong in the treasons which he
meditated but the sad voice and the mournful
look his uncle made him stand gazing
towards the door by which the earl had retired
and feel a strange and before unfelt sentiment
 sorrow mingled with fear
as he was standing thus dejected the lady
athos came into the room and he was startled
when he beheld her very wobegone and
seemingly touched with apprehensions hors
spaewife sector
and alarm surely said he to himself
 the weak old man cannot have told her 
what has passed between him and gramme
she however soon relieved his fears by
coming towards him and saying i am
glad that sir robert gramme was sent from
this house for every night that he remained
here my sleep was made hideous with the
most terrible fancies i have had no wholesome
rest but only strange snatches slumber
that have been more ful disease than
the entire lack sleep this very morning
i have been afflicted with such a sight that
i can hardly yet persuade myself it was
not some actual deed which i beheld and
not the fantastical imagery a distempered
dream
what was it that you saw said stuart
participating in the horror with which she
was affected
 oh danot inquire it was such things
as i may not without great sin venture to re
 the spaewife
late there wasblood and ashes and a
kingly crown and bleaching bones and the
birds the air 
the earl returned at that moment and
that she might not be questioned by him concerning
the mysterious cause her grief she
stooped behind to clear as it were some entanglement
 her robe and then quitted the
room to conceal that she was in tears

when nigel glehfruin saw that his father
was aware the sex the lord
james in the disguise the leddy 
garments he feared that an immediate
search would be ordered and alarmed
for the issue instead returning to
the hall where his absence was so soon remarked
by the herald he followed the track
which the fugitive had taken in order to apprise
him his danger and to aid his escape
but it was some time before he came up with
him indeed not until the lord james had
reached the skirts the wood along the margent
 the lake and was standing there disconsolate
and breathless not knowing what
course to choose
the jeopardy into which that illfated prince
s the spaewife
had fallen was too imminent to admit much
time for parley and nigel was not a youth
given to unnecessary talk having briefly
prospered his services he added
 there is a boat hard by come with me
to the place get on board and make what
speed you can to the other side the lake or
to some one the islands where in the morning
you will kindle a fire to let us know
where you are and celestine campbell or myself
will find means to come to your assistances

c
celestine campbell exclaimed the lord
james and was proceeding to inveigh against
his treachery when nigel assured him that
he had no truer froid and that he believed
celestine had come to glenfiruin only in quest
 him and to do him sarice shortly rehearsing
what had passed between them on
the castlejiill
while they were thus speaking as they
walked hastily towards the boat they heard
the spaewife sd
a voice singing cheerily but with a wild and
strange melody ever and anon changing
they halted and nigel going to the edge 
the shore knelt down and listened with his
ear close to the water
it is but the voice i ample 
said he rising
they then quickened their steps forward
and soon came in sight the little creek
where the boat was lying fastened by a cable
c hair to the bough a doddered tree
which overhung the water and at the foot
c which the spaewife was sitting
 what do you there anniple said
nigel to her
i'm waiting for a braw bridegroom
that s coming to take me over the water and
in making this answer she threw her eyes
quickly about and seeing the lord james in
the apparel the lady glenjfuckie she
started up and began to laugh and cap her
hands tripping around him like one dane
 the specifying
the volta and singing as if she swept the
ground with a long and spacious train 
 gar our gudeman trew
that i'll tak the fling strings
gif he winna buy to me
twelve bonny gold rings 
ane for ilia finger
an twa for ilia thumb i

that sell the ladle
gif he winna buy to me
a braw riding saddle
to ride t the kirk and frae the kirk
and up and down the town 
and stand about you saucy quean
an gie my gown room
while she was thus leaping and singing
nigel unmoored the boat and pushing it into
deeper water the lord james sprung onboard
and anniple followed him
the pabwife 
 how is this ample said nigel i
thought you were waiting for a bridegroom to
take you over 
r a be done yell no have to say
that i did na pay the ferryfee
the spaewife s
 and what is my fortune to be replied
the lord james resting his arms on the oars
 without seer or prophecy this much it
i can read myself ewe shall not reach the
other shore tonight and must find our haven
in one these islands
 be thaakf ul said anniple the beagle
loses sent at the waterside aid she again
began to sing ad he to row
the darkness the night was then fast
closing around the blast came in fits from the
hills and the skies had for some time been
overcast the dampness the air betokened
rain but when it came on it was a moisture
that rather oozed to wetness on the sense than
fell with any palpable annoyance anniple
however refrained from singing and cowered
down into the bottom the boat where she
remained silent but ever and anon she raised
her head and bared her ear to the wind and
listenedwhile the rising blast and drifting
waters sent a coldness upon the spirit the
s the paewife
ird james that made him sometimes almost
resolve to abandon the oars and allow
the boat to be driven to her fate
in one these despondent moods he said
 you have not yet told me what my fortune
is to be i doubt anniple his something
that you fear to tsll
 hush hush the worst peril your lifers
no far off was her reply and she raised her
head and peered along the waves and listened

 what shall wed said the lord james
somewhat impressed by the evident anxiety
and eagerness her manner row with die
oars and plash in the waters
 tide whatever may betide
they're no to be bon that maun be your bride
i see a sight and i hear a sound and now fll
pay the ferryfee
immediately thereupon she resumed the
place on the bench where she was first seated
the spaewife ml
and began to hang with a loud and sear voice
and so continued to do for some time at the
 every overcome the ditty saying in a
whisper
they've coming they're coming they're
coming 
the spirit the lord james was in unison
wkh the despair his fortunes and he
looked around on the darkheaving waters
and to the starless sky his hands unused
to the hard labour which he had long plied
urere then glowing almost to burning and
bisface chilled with the mist the night he
felt that he had sounded the depths adversity

 they're coming i they're coming they're
coming said anniple again in a still more solemn
whisper at the close a vers which she
had hilariously sung and her words seemed to
be the more fearful because the mirth her
song vfbich she resumed in a moment after
with still grater glee in the middle 
the paewife
ever the music die tfuddeily paused and
quid 
 i see them yonder black atweaoi the
water and the skye
the lord james looked along the waiter
and she continued to sing with a still blither
note it was not however till she had again
repeated in the same strange and oracular
manners they're coming they coming 
they're coming that he at last discerned a
large boat with a wide sail spread sailing
before the wind and holding such a course
as would bring her within a dirt distance
then it was that he discovered the craft
 the loud and mirthful ballad which
she was singing for the boat soon drawing
near one on board hailed them and inquired
where they were going
the lord james would have answered
but anniple laid her hand on his lips and replied
in the words the old song the kimmeres
crank 
ths paewife 
 and we toomt the bowie
o ho o ho trie trow trie 
and the bride was fou and coupit over
as fou as a sow was she

what anniple is it you and what
wedding have you come from p cried another
 those who were in the boat which by this
time was close at hand
 m no tell till i ken jvrhare yere going
was her answer
 ask her said the voice who had first
spoken and then a third person said
 have you heard any thing the lord
james albany the rebel 
o aye washer answer the provost 
dumbarton catched him on the hills 
and lias taken him sway they say to be
hangt
who have you in the boat with you 
 the miller losses deaf and dumb
doctor i wish she was blind likewise for
seeing you she has stopped the oars and i
l 
 the paewife
may as well think to gar ben lomond dance
la volta to my singing as bid her row till
ye're awa a very good night i wish you
to this no answer was made but only a
shout laughter and anniple resuming her
song the boat sailed away
 i trow said anniple lat i have well
paid my ferryfee and now may ye fliiape
your course what way you will your moons
changed and the market hour your night
past and she began to laugh and chatter
curiously with her teeth saying they'll
hae three een that'll see throws me
the wonderment the lord james was
very great at the simplicity wherewith she
had answered and beguiled the officers in the
boat truly said he thou hast indeed
well paid thy ferryfee but whither shall i now
go for all the country will soon be afoot to take
me and those in that boat will speedily suspect
what has been when they learn how i am disguised
in leddy glenjuckie's apparel
the spaewif 
anniple however had no power nor capacity
to advise but she replied 
 gang as ye will ye have but one road
aid that ye maun travel or sail happen what
wills
so he being weaned with his labour and
his hands very sore made for inchmoran
iere they landed

the time was now drawing near which the
king had set for laying the foundation the
grand abbey the charturaiis at perth according
as he had secretly vowed to do whenever
peace and good order were established
throughout the realm and he sent letters to all
his great lords and puissant barons inviting
them to be witnesses the solemnity ordering
manifold preparations to be made for the
entertainment the commonalty who from all
parts were flocking to behold the pomp such
a ceremony as had not been seen in scotland
since the prosperous days kmg david
the first and the better to celebrate this
epoch blessed peace in a christian manner
all prisoners who were not accused the
four great crimes were to be forgiven their
the spaewife 
transgressions and set free the queen herself
who had never ceased to lament the absence
 her beloved lady sibilla wrote kind
letters to her earnestly entreating her to come
again to court and exhorts her with all
the pith and marrow sweet eloquence to
do her so signal a favour at that time for
without her the eings pious pageantry would
lack in the satisfaction which she decree
thereat to enjoy
for a time the lady sibiua withstood all
these royal entreaties and passed the slow
and melancholia hours in the peaceful nunnery
 inchcold tasting however no
pleasure from the pitiful ministrations the
holy sisterhood scarcely even soothed by their
orisons in which though she bore a part
and mingled her voice with the requiems to
heaven the ties youthful love and the
weight fond anxieties held her forlorn
spirit in captivity on the earth her only solace
was in wandering round the cliffs the
sf the spaewife
island and often alter the vesperhsoiig ae
retired alone to the western summit the
hill that overlooks the bay ardour and
there with her cheek resting on her hand
worm sit listening to the breaking the hollow
waves belowthe only dwight she tasted
in all her sequestration being from the murmuring
 ths sullen harmonies
it happened soon after the adventures
whereof recital has been made that one night
as she sat in that dismal condition she observed
by the obscure light the stars a
boat coming near to the rocks under the cliff
where she was seated and in the sound 
the voices those aboard she thought that
there was one which she had heard before 
o beingffloved by curiosity from her bsdess
need she rose and went near to a little bay in
the shore to which she saw the boat was making
and on drawing near heard glenfruin
exdainv
 sowlls and bodies eings herald and
the spaewife

and a kirk and a tower in te sensibility our

the herald explained to him that it was a
ttunnery and not a monastery which he saw 
and that although they might be permitted to
pass the night in the chapel yet while the
weather held up be would rather remain in
the boat
put relied glenfniin we would pe
making our relations caz you know king's
herald tat were in a jeopardy
 for that said keith i have no objection
to land for half an hour or so but
we must first let the abbess know for there
have been sadi things done in holy houses by
persons seeking admission on pious pretexts
that i doubt we should not else be allowed to
enter the church
the lady sibilla on hearing this went
quickly to the convent and apprised the nuns
is the spaewnre
 the amval the boat and mentioned who
glenfruin was and in what manner be had ao
faithfully protected herself by which predictions
when keith and the chieftain came to the
gate to ask admission to the chapel they were
readily allowed entrance and the nuns in consideration
 the hospitality that he had shewn
to the lady sibilla in her distress jmrqpared a
repast for them by the time they had finished
their orisons to the which she was iqqpointed
to invite them not bring professed to the
veil accordingly when they rose from their
kneeling before the altar she went into the
chapel and met them as they were coming
away
 sowus and bodies is it a ghost fine te

he saw her advancing and immediately
with many inflexions brushing the pavement
 the church with his bonnet he went towards
her saying

this was not stated with sufficient perspicuity
to enable the lady sibilla to comprehend

 a still greater offence no less than 
seizing the duchess albany after rise was
set free by the eings command and holding
her as his prisoner r a radomthe
which is an offence that the king will not
lightly jiardoil
the mention her grace's name touched

 i hope interposed the herald that
you will be able to prove it was so but it
is growing late and we must return to the
boat that we may get to burntisland by daylight
else shall we not be able to reach perth
tomorrow night in time to give you a chance
 being included in the general pardon for

the ikt the absolved will be published in

the lady sibilla then invited them to partake
 the refection which the charitable
nuns had prepared and having retired to her
wn cell she communed with herself on what
dbbe had heard and began to wish that she
bad accepted the queen's invitation in order
faat she mist lucre been on the spot to 
fhqr majesty's mediation in behalf 
glenfruin whose faults were more his
simplicity and ignorance than any innate
aeo the paswife
malice heart and the more she thought
 this her wish began to take the strength
 desire in so much that by the time die
guests finished their repast she had informed
the countess boss that she intended
to go with them in the boat and return for a
time to court to use her good cfioes in behalf
 one by whom in her extreme distress
she had been so favoured
the countess whose anger against the
king for the little reverence that was paid to
the submisfflott the lord the isles burnt
as fiercely as ever said all she could to dissuade
her and even chided her inconstancy
 mind but much what she urged instead
 weakening the resolution the lady
sibilla made it stronger and thus it came
to pass that die went with glenfruin and the
herald and with the wonted freedom her
spirit unattended by any damsel accompanied
them to perth where on arriving and
learning that the king was then holding a
th spaewife s
aolenm council at scone she exhorted the
herald to take his prisoner at once thither
and going herself with them she was soon
welcomed by the sisterly embraces the
queen who rejoicing to see her much lauded
her coming the joy whereof was enriched
by being so unexpected
 the spaewif
chap xxiii
nicely after leaving the creek where the lord
james and the space wis e had embarked returned
towards the tower gleofruin pondering
on what anniple had said and full a fearful
dubiety concerning the things whereof she
had spoken and celestine after going some
distance on the road towards less returned
to the same place considering with himself
that by the time he again reached the castlehill
the herald with the chieftain and his attendants
would be far advanced on their way
to dumbarton whither as it has been rehearsed
they were minded to go that night
thus it fell out that nigel and celestine met
at the castlegate where they respectively conferred
 what had come to pass 
by this foe the night had set in showery
the spaewife sand
blustering on the hills so that there was
no choice but for celestine to abide in the
caste notwithstanding the prohibition which
glenfruin himself had laid against all strangers
accordingly after some further parley
partly arising from the jealousy wherewith nigel
saw his clansmen would regard the entrance
 the campbellss into the castle during the
absence their chief it was agreed in order
to present quarrels that celestine alone
should be admitted and that his men should
pass the night on the hill
about the time that this had been determined
the boat which passed the lord james
and the spiwife arrived at the foot the
water glenfruin and those who were onboard
having landed walked towards the
tower the lights which they had seen from
the lake but on the shore the drizngly
shower so rose on the blast in their faces that
they were obligated to pass from time to time
a wardword among them in order that they
s the spaewife
might not scatter themselves so far a to lose
one another
meanwhile celestine being admitted into
the castle the gates were jealously diet and a
strong watch set both on the walls and in the
court m case any treachery among the
campbell and these wardens hearing the
sound many voices approaching as the
strangers drew near were in great consternation
and alarm and secretly called nigel from
the hal to warn him danger
nor was this without a show reason for
the campbell as they lay on the ground in
the lea the furze on the hill also heard
the same sounds afar off and listening and
conferring together they discovered the tieword
to be cme that was their own whereupon
they rose with a great shout which struck
such fear into the breasts the glenfruins
that four them instantly rushed into the
hall and seized celestine and father donich
as they were sitting together discoursing in
the spaewife 
the chimney comer and made them prisoners 
believing that the arrival a new band 
campbell at that hour was all a stratagem
to possess themselves the castlesuch
doings being adventures ordinary custom
during the turbulent rule and regency the
albanies
celestine and the chaplain not knowing
what had chanced without were in great
amazement and bitterly reviled the perfidy 
the glenfruins
the manner in which the duchess had been
made prisoner the pretext on which the
campbellss had been denied the ordinary
usages hospitality and the marvelous cunning
as it seemed a youth so young and
 fair spoken as nigel were all things so
much the same quality and spirit that ce
heroine could find no sufficient words for his
indignation his greatest alarm however
was for his cousin the lord james the
toxy which nigel had told him his embarks
 m
 the spaewifb
tion he believed to be a fraudulent invention
and he made no doubt that the illfated prince
was delivered into the custody the herald
to win favour with the government for his
father
the anger nigel was not less ardent
against the deceit with which he on his part
conceived himself to have been treated and
he returned into the hall with hb sword unsheathed
and upbraided celestine with many
sharp and rankling taunts in the midst
however their mutual upbraiding and the
noise and dissonance that reigned within and
without a horn was heard at the gate
nigel at the sound desisted from the
scorn with which he was addressing his suspected
guest and sheathing his sword went
to learn who it was that so courteously
sought admission finding after some short
parley that the strangers were clothed with
authority from theing he gave orders tolet
them in and soon returned ushering them
j
the spabwife 
into the hall where celestine and father
donich were still standing in the middle 
the floor with their arms pinioned to diei
sides by the fierce and stalwart glenfruins
the strangers were sir duncan campbell
 loch aw the father celestine and sir
patrick gramme kincardine with certain
 their respective retainers
sir duncan was sent by the king to take
the duchess from glenfruin and to conduct
her wheresoever she chose to go and sir
patrick was empowered with a royal mandate
to raise the country in order that effectual
search might be made for the lord james
they had come together from the buchanan
shore in the same boat though their missions
were so different and out tenderness for
her grace's great sufferings it was covenanted
between them that until she was removed
sir patrick should say nothing his warrant
nor move in the execution thereof it
was in consequence thought by nigel to
 the spaewifb
whom sir duncan had declared the purport
 their visit that they were come for the
same object
but the knight loch aw had no sooner
entered the hall when seeing the singular
and ignominious manner in which his son
and domestic chaplain were held than he loudly
demanded an explanation
celestine knowing how little his father
would approve the adventure in which he
had embarked for the lord james briefly
stated that in pursuit his game he had
been led to lochlomondside and had come in
the afternoon to glenfruin wherein was minded
to spend the night but that in a sudden
manner both he and father donich were made
prisoners and held in the condition in which
he saw them the reason wherefor h could
not divine unless it were to extort from them
a ransom such as glenfruin himself had
intended to do with his aunt the duchess
 albany who was then in the castle
the spaewife 
this tale did not however satisfy sir
duncan campbell who was no stranger to
the partialities which his son bore towards
his mother's turbulent kindred and he turned
round abruptly to father donich and demanded
to know how he too was there
 what game said he has led father dorich
to lochlomondside
sir patrick grseme was not a little amazed
at idiot was thus passing and listened and
looked on with his mind apert and his suspicions
all awake for he well knew how
much the house loch aw was divided miaccount
 the filial affections the lady
father donich bang at a loss what answer
to make instead replying struggled to be
free those who held him in their grip
in the meantime nigel remembering what
celestine had said with respect to the difference
between him and his father concerning
his kinsman quickly discovered the hasty
error which in a moment alarm he had so
 the spaewifk
discourteously committed against his guest
and replied without seeming to have ob
served what sir duncan had said to father
donich
 i am grieved for what has happened 
but this evening my father was summoned
by horn and caption to appear before the
king and having been taken away it washis
command that during his absence strangers
should not be admitted when however
celestine campbell came hither i
could not deny him so much hospitality a
shelter for the night still anxious however
that my father's orders should not be
altogether contemned it was agreed that
his clansmen should remain on the hill
where it would appear when they heard you
coming they shouted and made a noise the
which caused us to fear that the campbell
were come first with celestine to gain admission
by stratagem and then with you to cook
summit the plot
the spaewifb 
 the tale is plausible said sir patrick
grasme but how id it that this reverend
friar is also here 
father donich now having recovered his
wits was able to frame a fdr story replied
 i was sent by my good lady loch aw
to bear her kind and loving condolence to
the duchess
may this be credited p inquired sir
patrick addressing himself to sir duncan
who evidently in much trouble said 
 i pray you do not sift me in this too
curiously i have ever done my duty as a
true man in the king's service and i have
never known my son guilty any dishonour
i think it may not be questioned that my wife
was likely to send her chaplain on the errand
which he says and i will acknowledge to
you freely that i suspect my son has also
come with some similar intent
i see not replied the knight kincardine
 much to condemn in all that but
xt th spaewif
turning to nigel he added have yoa
heard ought ia these parts the traitor
james albany b
 yes replied nigel he was here this
afternoon
 what in diis castles inquired sir
patrick eagerly celestine campbell gasped
and father donich stood like one that 
smitten with some inexpressible despondency
 no not in the castles resumed nigel 
but just under the walls
 and what has become him why
did you not seize him wherefore was he
allowed to escape exclaimed sir patrick
gramme
 he was not allowed to escape
 o treacherous villain p muttered celestina
unable any longer to restrain his grief
at such treachery
sir duncan campbell said nothing but
ruefully shook his head while sir patrick
resumed addressing sir duncan 
the spaemafe 
 the poor creature in the boat with the
deaf and dumb woman has then told us true
he has been carried to dumbarton
nigel immediately discerned that they must
have met the lord james in his disguise
with anniple and he added briskly i
know not by whom he was taken but most
likely it may have been by the governor 
dumbarton who has at present with him a
great force
celestine looked at nigel and felt that he
had done the youth injustice but he could
make no atonement in the presence those
before whom he then stood
i fear celestine said his father that
you have greatly incurred the king's displeasure
 but since your unfortunate cousin
is taken go with sir patrick gramme in the
morning to perth and do what you can to
make your peace with his majesty as soon
as i have executed my orders with respect to
the duchess i will follow you thither
m
t the spaewife
thus was order restored in the hall 
glenfruin and next morning all due preparation
for the same being made the
duchess with leddy glenjuckie and celestina
embarked along with sir duncan campbell
and the knight kincardine for inchmurrain

the spaewife s
chap xxiv
soon after the departure thosewho went
away with the duchess nigel according to
what had been sanctioned with the lord james
ascended the hill behind the tower glenruin
to see if he might discover where the
prince had landed by the smoke any fire
on the ben lomond side the lake but
although the air was clear and still in so
much that the shadows all things in the
water were not rumpled by the transit the
softest breeze he yet could discern no signal
 the kind and he returned to the castle in
much tribulation spirit and rested his
forehead on his hand not knowing what he
should then do for being scarcely more
than a stripling he lacked that confidence in
himself which prompts to faith in others
 tub spaewot
and anxkms as he was to consult with someof
those the clan whom he knew to he hold
and discreet he was diffident to trust them
with the matter his fears on account the
situation in which his father their chieftain
and master then was placed
he was fearful they would think it their
duty only to search for the outlaw in order
that he might he given up for glenfroin or
for the reward that the service bringing in
so eminent an offender was likely to obtain 
sortie had overheard them murmuring during
the night that the opportunity taking him
should have been so lost
he hadnot however remained long in
that posture doubt and rumination wren
hector macallisner glenmallochan one
 those in whom he was most inclined to confide
came and informed him that the clansmen
from all parts were gathering in much malcontent
that glenfruin should have been taken
away
the spaewife 
we said he who accompanied the
herald to dumbarton were not permitted
to enter the town but were driven away
in a contumelious manner we made not
the value a cock nor a hen by the jour
ney
all we do now continued hector mac
palliser glenmallochan speaking in the
celtic tongue which maybe thus rendered
 all is for a nothing hamies maclean 
mollincruine wanted to get a cow with calf
for his wife's downing and young ivan
maclean ardgask would hae been content
with a sucking horse as his own foal
was lifted last week by some the macfar
lakes or the colquhoun elinor macha
mies had promised his new wife a web 
cheque or larn and walter due wished
for but a spade the shaft his own being
broken one the bailies has a saddle
that would just have fitted my gelding
but devil a thing got we at all
s the spaewife
what a pity said nigel and how
did it so happen 
it comes all the english king's new
laws replied hector macallisner wards
are set round the town to warn the burghers
when any highlanders are seen coming naive
which is a custom that should not be endured
we shall soon be all fireside sloths like the
lowlanders for in consequence when we
were within about halfamile the town the
burghers came forth with swords and bows in
such force that we durst not touch the hair
 a horse's tail the very wives ran flapping
with their aprons driving their cocks
and hens into the houses the time has
been when they all fled screaming to the hills
and left every thing to our free choosing
but i fear i fear that the hearty days 
rigging and grieving are gone that the age
 lawyers and warders has come and the
glory the highlands is departed for ever 
nigel was very sorrowful to hear hector
i
the spaewife 
macallisner speak in this mournful manner
and bade him hope for better times
ah r replied hector we shall never
see the blithe days again that we had in duke
miuxlochs time then the lowlanders respected
the heroic virtues the highlanders
and there was neither scant nor want the
best things not only dumbarton but even
 glasgow and renfrew in the very shillings
 the hills lennoxaye even 
lorn
 it was indeed a black day for au this
countrysides sidd nigel when the duke
brought in king james
 in losing his head for his pains he got
but a just reward said hector but the
whole highlands owe the glenfruins a grudge
because we took not the lord james side at
the burning dumbarton glad we done
so he might this day have been the king on
the throne and what a blessing that would
have been to all the highlanders p
 the paewife
nigel was scxnewhat surprised to hear him
speak after that manner and said it was
always hitherto thought that my father acted
a wise and a discreet part on that occasions
 what has he made by it p exclaimed
hector did not the macfarlanes the macaulay
the colquhoun and the macgregor
feather their nests with the earl lennox
cattle to say nothing what the buchanan
and others hermit from his lands beyond the
leven before the highlanders got there while
the glenfruins were sitting on the hills with
their fingers in their mouths
 but my father expected said nigel
 that he would have been rewarded with some
part the earldom lennox
 has he been so rewarded cried hector
growing more vehement what got the
clan by their readiness in rising against the
macdonald but thar own meal which they
carried with them fcnr the war p what got
glenfruin for catching sir robert grime
the spaewife st
and taking him to blair athos but cold
thanks for his pains and the duchess that
we all expected would have paid a rich roo
torn is not she taken away and glenfruin
himself that should be here is tie not carried
off to be hang or headed like a traitor cas
ye that a reward either to chief or clan
but nigel glenfruin that is not what i
am sent from the clansmen to tell you we
like not that you showed have known how the
lord james was her yesterday especially
that instead trusting your own men you
should have been in league with celestine
campbell concerning him
 what would the clan have done had i
broken my word and betrayed the prince 
 we would have hang the king's herald
fcht daring to arrest glenfruin in his own castle
and have set up the princeall the lennox
men are ripe and ready to take his part
but nigel glenfruin you have not a true
heart neither for father nor kinsman and the
 the spaewifb
clan are resolved to make your cousin rodric
macnigel chief till glenfruin is restored
unless you will give them satisfactions
what satisfaction do they expect said
nigel struggling to appear calm and collected

that you will tell them where the lord
james is for they know it is not as was said
that he has yet been talteri
 and if i do so what then 
 and that you wil at soon as it can safely
be done ether demand or take from the
duchess a sufficient satisfaction for the ransom
that was expected
 we might as well declare ourselves in
rebellion at once surely you cannot but
know that the kings strength is every wherein
the country and there is no clan however
powerful that may venture to measure swords
with it have you not but just told me that
you dare not lift a cow or a carrion from the
very burghers dumbarton truly hec
the spaewife 
tor macallisner this is mutiny and sedition
without reason and i will not ruin the clan
by lending myself to the blind impulses 
mere rage
he then paused and communed with himself
for some time in hence after which he
added 
this much i will do freely hector let
us seek the lord james who must be somewhere
about the skirts the lake but let the
clan consider that ae is our lawful prince
and may one day be king even by right
without might whether it would not be wise
to refrain from any attempt to molest his
mother this i was minded toe have proposed
to you for unless we find and succour
h hunger will soon drive him into the
hands others who will thereby gain au the
advantages that mht be ours
hector pondered for some times and then
he said
 the spaewife
 but nvhat shall we do with him if we do
not set him up p
 keep him in secret be hospitable to him
earn his favour and await what is to come
hereafter
some farther discourse ensued wherein
hector was made sensible that the young
chieftain counselled more wisely than those
who had sent him to make their complaint
fid he returned to them on the castlehill
where they were assembled and reported
what had passed nigel soon after also went
thither and though for the most part they
received him with joyous shouts yet were
many among them sullen and stubbornly
knotted to the mutinous suggestions his
cousin homeric macnigel a fierce and headstrong
youth who thought by fostering these
discontents to have been chosen chief till the
return his uncle and by course things
if he was never permitted to return to have
remained his successor
the spaewife 
nigel was sorely grieved to observe this division
among his clansmen and fearing that
those who were his cousins faction would
frustrate the scheme which he had proposed
and betray the illfated outlaw whom he was
so anxious to protect he returned into the
hall followed by hector macallisner and
almost wept for bitterness spirit at finding
himself environed with difficulties which as
it then seemed could not be mastered without
great detriment to his own honour and
danger beyond all estimate or measure to the
clan
s the spaewife
chap xxv
in the meantime the lord james and annile
being driven by the wind and waves into
the narrow sound between inchoonagan and
inchmoan landed op the latter island and
went in search a place shelter for the
wind was gusty and from time to time the
tail a heavy shower swept over them the
lord james weary at heart and heavy with
his disconsolate thoughts walked on in 
hence and anniple followed ever and anon
lifting the skirt his plaid to screen her
from the rain as she went coweringly behind
crooning some old uncouth ditty
their search however was in vain for neither
rock nor tree could be found and though
from time to time the faint and ghastly light
 the northern streams broke from the
the spaewife 
clouds and dimly showed all around the black
moss and the dark heaving waters no sign 
any shelter could be discovered still the
wind was rising the showers were coming
heavier aid faster and anniple not only refrained
from churning her song but began
to ban the malicious fairies that had made her
to suffer such a life molestation
as they were thus wandering in the gloom
the lord james chanced to stumble into a
place whence seats had been delved and
would have fallen headlong but that at the
time anniple had hold his plaid when
however he recovered and turned round to
speak to her she was gone having darted
away like an arrow from a bow notwithstanding
the darkness the night she ran
straight back to the boat on board which
she leapt at once and gathered herself as
it were into a bunch in the bottom saying

 beds were made for the blest and the
 the spaewife
ixmh but the lea a deal or a dyke's good
enough for me
in that situation she fell asleep and when
she awoke and looked over ths side the
boat e found that the tempest haa ceased
and that the grey eye the morning was
just beginning to peer through the mist into
which the heavy clouds the night had resolved
themselves
being cold and wet she almost immediately
cowered down again into the bottom the
boat but suddenly recollecting that she was
alone and in the middle the lake she starts
ed up and began to cry and bail with a loud
and shrill voice in the hope that she might be
heard then she attempted to move the
oars which swung on pivots but they were too
ponderous for her strength and she soon
abandoned the toil at last she bethought
herself the ragged remnant that served
her for a mantle and getting up on a bench
she spread it to the wind in this manner
the spaewifje 
she drifted near to the shore where the
river leven runs away there leaving the
boat loose on the margent the lake she
went up the country reckless the condition
in which she had left her companion
it had however fared better with the
lord james than with her for after she
left him he came to a hovel raised by the
peatmakers to sleep in when employed in
digging the turf and he went into it and
found a better asylum than i could have
hoped to meet with on that lone and mean
copious island having struck a limit with
his sword from a shone he kindled a fire with
some the moss and turf wherewith the bield
was covered at which he sat fcr some time
expecting the spaewife but seeing she came
not he went often to the door and called herby
nine fearing that some accident had befallen
her as however she never made her
appearance he began to conjecture that she
had perhaps found some sdndlar place sh
vol k
 the paewife
ter and oompofled himself to sleep to which
he was the more eaaify invited by the anxieties
and the toil he had undergone
in this state defencelessness he continued
till the sun was risen and when
he awoke he beheld an old man a veryvenerable
aspect standing mournfully over
him his countenance was pale dejected
and meek and there was a holiness in his
eyes that betokened the patient melancholy
 a reigned and sorrowful heart his
garb and the rosary at his girdle shewed
that he was a priest but he wore no cow
and his grey hair fell over his dark vesture
like the breaking a silva strewn down the
rocky side a heathy hill
the lord james at once started up and
gazing at him for a moment rushed into his
fjeitheriy embraces for in him lie discovered
the aged confessor his grandfather the
earl lennox but the old man for sometime
could only weep
the spaettife 
 alas my dear lord said he i
drought that i had shed all my tears and that
when i had followed my noble master to his
doom heaven had reserved for me no greater
trial but the condition in which i have
found you tells me that there was a pang
which tu this morning i had not proved o
the anguish that pity with which i beheld
the son so many kings sleeping forlorn in
such a place as this 
father eessog then told him that after
the dreadful business at stirling he had retired
from the world and reared a lowly cell
in one the neighbouring islands where he
had since lived in undisturbed solitude the
life a hermit come with me thither
you will be safer than here for the people
around ever since i took up my abode alone
have regarded inchtavannach as a consecrated
places
the lord james was right well content to
experience so soon the truth the predictions
 the spaewifr
with which anniple had in h uncouth sin
felicity tied to cheer him and lie entreated
that she might be sought for and tdkesi with
them after however going all round the
island and seeing that the boat in wludi he had
come was not there they naturally concluded
she had gone away in it as rehearsed and they
returned back to alittletree close to the shore
near the hovel where they embarked on a raft
which the hermit had brought with um and
which he had fastened to the tree
 a iiume maiden mild and meed
werenmk sae jimp at silly 
 lake onytose her read wsa reds
her lew ma like the lily
o yellow yellow was her head
but she wi love was silly 
though a her kin had sworn her dead
she would have hut sweet wilts
 how can yousaid the queen coming
towards them tease her with such poor
madrigals
 ah r replied his majesty laughing i
nev knew a wife that was not jealous her
husbands muse but what can we do to
content our fair cousin and prove how truly
we esteem this unlookedfor pleasure 
 o i many things many said the lady
sibilla still in a jocund key but i shall
be too happy with two and one them is the
fulfilment a promise an ancient date
namely that pretty impress your majesty's
mellifluous poesy the kings quair in
 xh spabwif
scribed on vellum by the westminster pman 
and wherein there is that fair limning the
queen as she is depicted in the terse smiling
with the inward delight some kind
fancy it is a debt that your majesty is not
honest in withholding
 and it shall be paid this same night 
but what other grace will you demands i
pray it may not be era to the half our
kmgdom
a httle pause thereon followed and boll
the queen and the lady catherine douglas
looked grave at eadx other the lady si
bill however put on her gayest smile and
said 
 i doubt not it will be more readily accorded
to me than the first for i would but
ask what will give pleasure to his majesty
without making him poorer
 a simple old man who has been my companion
hither stands somewhat in the shade
 yoinr royal pleasure and he has come
tub spaewifsl 
i find too late to be included in the general
paldbri
the kmgs smile disappeared but the
queen took the lady sicilia by the hand and
said to his majesty's
 now were i the king i would comply
smith this charity and give the pardon on the
suit our cousin without requiring to know
more it is sufficient tluit the offender has
obtained her advocacy
his majesty sighed and with a mild and
gradus accent replied to the queenthat
you love me with all the constancy
and affection which the heart man can desire
in wranan i believe as sincerely as any
worshipper who hath faith in the shrine to
which he kneels but i would have you to
love my honour and renown also for kings
have two natures and characters sin the one
weak passionate and froward they move in
their errors like the lowest vassal in the
other they are as gods abstract and sublime
 the spaewifbl
and according as their edicts and awards
favour right or wrong they bless or blight
not only the world in their own time but in
all time coming for whom is it swe cousin
that you intercedes
the lady sibilla was as well as the queen
and the lady katherine douglas somewhat
dismayed by the altered mann his
majesty but still affecting to make light 
the favour she replied 
 it is the old loyal chieftain that so kindly
treated me during the rebellion in lennox

what glenfruin said the king ihe
accusation against him is heavy indeed
the lady sibilla perceiving his majesty
was about to declare that until the extent
 his guilt was investigated he could not
eve any promise exclaimed hastily and with
a sprightly tone i do not wish to hear 
what he stands accused but grant me so
much grace on your royal promise as to call
the spaewifb sos
him before your majesty in private before
he is put upon his trial for poor man he
hath not much the art to set off his jdain
talc to any advantages
his majesty smiled and assented that it
should be so ah thus it is said he
 that in their hours ease princes do things
which however pure in themselves oipteh
take the bearing an ignoble partiality in
the eyes the world we need however
he added more gravely some little favour
from power to countervail the invidious misrepresentations
 our affections it is hard
to deny to us the practice one the best
virtues other men the indulgence kind
wishes towards those who in our humbler
nature have commended themselves to our
esteem
the lady sibilla then recounted apart to
the ladies her adventure on the night the
burning dumbarton the main tale 
which she had told the queen before aft
 the pabwifb
her return to court from glenfniins castle
and particularly those things which had
moved her to allow anniple to take her
place in the boat with the monk these
her majesty had in her turn imperfectly
rehearsed to the king not conceiving that
by any chance the matter should ever come
again into controversy it happened however
that whue the lady sibilla was then
telling what had befalls her his majesty
remembering the complaint the prior
by whom he had been induced to order the
summons for glenfruin inquired if she
knew the name the monk that went in the
boat and when she answered mungo he
exclaimed suddenly
why that was the name the idly
man whose martyrdom i was obliged to
hear so much oh it is too true that kings
live in chamber with painted windows
the fair and true light rarely shines in upon
them
the spaewife 
chap xxvii
tb appointed day being now come on which
the foundationstone the eings new abbey
was to be laid pleasant it would be to depart
the thronging the marvelling and the mingling
 all sorts pecle together in perth
that morning and to rehearse how wards
were set around the town to keep out the
highlanders who in latter times have so
meritoriously down themselves worthy to
bear a part in the peaceful pageantries 
national granulation how the monks and
friars were all courtesie in getting commodious
places for their friends and how the
bailies and others the city and the guildry
thereof from time to time got their wives and
daughters cannily slipped into the galleries set
 th spaewifb
apart for ladies pedigree but puissant must
be the pen that would set down how at the
hour ceremony the friars came forth
swinging their censers burning incense and
with lighted tapers and banners and images
and shrines relics and all manner pomp
ecclesiastical followed by the gentle nuns
prolonging like sweet echoes the harmonies
 their masculine anthems and how with
the sound trumpets and the drum'a triumphal
thunder the knights and nobles in
cloaks and mantles velvet came as harbingers
to the king and with what ritual
and mysteries masonry the foundationstone
was laid in its place these things however
albeit great moment touching the prosperity
 the rem must be surpassed to
make room for what chanced on that day in
the matters and issue this eventful history
when the ceremonial was over and all those
who had part therein were returned to their
respective places abode in the town the
the pabwife 
earl athos and stuart who had accompanied
the king back to the abbeypalace 
scone retired towards the chambers set apart
for ths entertainment and it chanced that
in going along the closer which led thereto
stuart followed the earl quickly as if p
speak with him some matter wherewith his
mind wa filled but when he was come within
two or three paces he appeared to falter
and the earl looking back and seeing who it
was by whom he had been so followed increased
his pace and hastened forward as it
wee to eschew him
the dubiety however that caused stuart
at first to check his speed did not last long
for he followed the earl more briskly than
ever and entered into a chamber with him
where as the old man untied the mantle that
he had worn in the pageant stuart saide
 i was alarmed lest the show should
have been interrupted by some dreadful ac
cident
 the paewife
 row r replied iik earl what war
there to cause such apprehension saw you
any thing to be afraid p
 i observed that as the king strewed the
com wine and oil upon the stone you grew
lory pales
the ears colour again disappeared and
his hand so shook that he rather entangled
than untied the knot he was endeavouring to
undo but he made no answer while stuart
continued with a little more eottsdexiee in his
manner
 i saw that your eye was drawn towards
some one in the crowds 
 think your said the earl eagerly that
it was remarked me p
 it was replied stuart
the emotion the earl on hearing this became
so manifest that he sat down having hk
mantle still untied and inquired with an
anxious and alarmed voice by whom he had
been observed
the spafiwife sll

by one in the garb a wild highlander 
his locks were shaggy his beard untrimmed
and his clothes were made up seemingly 
divers rags the cast weeds several beggars
they were so preposterously wretched he
waa apparelled as one might be that hath some
flaw in his wit and yet was he plainly not 
that nature for his eye was sharp and steady
and lighted up with a spirit full menace
and inventions
 it was not safe that a creature so fierce
and fantastical should have had leave to be
where he wash sid the earl
did you not my lord then know him
replied stuart but instead answering the
question the earl said thoughtfully
think you that he was noticed by the
king or by any those who were immediately
around his majesty i once or twice observed
the eyes the chancellor turned to
that side
 what signifies it if he did look how
s the pawif
should he discover him if your lordship
could not who are privy to his purpose 
 to what purpose exclaimed the earl
with a voice terror to what purpose p
and he rose hastily and walked with hurried
steps and perturbed gestures several times
to and fro in the chamber suddenly he appeared
to become calm and going to stuart
he said with a solemn voice in which there
was much sadness
 i charge you as you dread my displeasure
and the kings power never to speak
with him touching the rights which i was
defrauded for he is so maddened by the sense
 his own wrongs and hath such a tongue to
make the bad appear the better purpose that
out the despite which we have ourselves
borne he may deduce reasons that shall entice
you into great perils
 my lord whom do you speak replied
stuart with welufdgned amfachy and
wonderment 
the spaewife 
the earl wrung his hands rapidly breathed
quickly and looking round hastily
cried 
 i will have nothing to do with your intents
i know not what you speak i
pray to heaven that what i fear may be buta
phantasms
i thought you knew not that it was sir
robert gramme p said stuart still calmly and
with a searching look
the mention the name was like a spell
and the earl who had been so heady rash
and distempered in his manner became at
once serene and collected sayings
he has been too hardly dealt with and
adversity like a cruel rust has defaced the
original brightness his character but such
woful diane is not rare i have known
other men as well as poor sir robert gramme
whom heaven had intended for high purposes
but fortune and irresponsible accident
so transmuted the gold their nature into
vol o
 the spaewife
iron that at their exit from the scene 
this mortal theatre instead being honoured
with the peals and plaudits admiration
they have been followed by scorn and hissing
and their names loaded with all manner 
contumely so basely according to the judgment
 men did they fail in the performance
 their part and that too from nothing seemingly
in circumstance but altogether from
the meanness i would say the malice 
their motiveless endeavours
 and should honest men stand by and
see spirits such nobility crushed and cast
away said stuart somewhat abashed by
the vehemence the ears declamation i
could not refrain from spring to myself when
i saw the mournful plight to which grrseme
was reduced alas how woful hath adversity
degradedthe image groin that
brave man
 hush replied the earl we must not
give such license to our tongues the same
the spaewife 
merciless justice that haunts him down maybe
set on us
 you are watched ahready said a dreadful
voice
stuart drew his sword and the earl looked
like a distracted man but a loud laugh soon
relieved their consternation
it was sir robert gramme who hadj by
tampering with one the ears servants
i all whom he was much pitied obtained
admission into the chamber and stood
concealed within the arras waiting the ears
return
my lord's said gramme advancing in
the pride his might and mastery
the earl shrunk away exclaiming
 avaunt fiend demon tempt me no
more i will not be again tempted remorseless
and tremendous homicide f
gramme looked round to stuart with a
smile so gaunt hideous and triumphant
that he too was shaken and overawed
 the spawif
and then he again addressed the eitrl saying

 my lord when i had but the hill for
my hall the stars for candles and the snow
for a blanket when but the rain and the hail
and the sleet were my visitors hunger my
guestand night after night i heard but
the minstrelsy the tuneless wind and revenge
roaring from all the waters the
tunnel the garry and the tay i swore
not to heaven my lord that i would
have 
 i know i know all that you would say
cried the earl sinking into his seat
 and this day resumed gramme i had
quenched the thirst my dirk but he was
so fenced beyond my reach now this you
shall do for me 
 nothing nothing nothing exclaimed
the earl rushing wildly towards the door
gramme drew him back
 this passion is in part feigned said the
the spabwife 
traitor sarcastically my lord be stilly becalm
you are in my power
have you no ruth manhood in you 
cried the earl to stuart that you will not
help me from the fangs this fiend 
i fear said stuart to gramme that
we have thought him more with us than he is
the traitor paused and eyed the earl
with a stem and questioning eye and then
said with us or not with us he shall be
with us but he is so already my lord
all we ask you is neither to see nor to
hear and you will soon be regent scotland
then liake yourself king if you will
for a moment the earl paused and looked
alternately at stuart and gramme then he
walked slowly towards his chair and said ashe
sat down this is fate be it as you will
thou hast o heaven beheld my inward
agonies ever since the fiend laid his burning
hand upon me and thou hast been deaf unto
my prayers
p
 the spaewife
 you may save yourself stul said gramme
contemptuously by alarming the abbey
but my lord now that we have launched
ourselves in the same enterprise let there
henceforth be no more taunts between u
call me no longer deviland i shall not forget
the courtesy due to one that is hereafter
to be a eing
 how got you into this apartment p said
stuart anxious to break in upon the strain 
thar discourse
nay rather ask how i am to get out
exclaimed the traitor for at that moment a
rapid and sudden noise with the clank arms
was heard approaching in the cloister and
then an officer with several soldiers came
rushing into the room

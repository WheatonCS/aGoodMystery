in what capacity asked the old showman after a moment's
silence all of us here can get our bread in some creditable way
every honest man should have his livelihood you sir as i take it
are a mere strolling gentleman

i proceeded to inform the company that when nature gave me a
propensity to their way of life she had not left me altogether
destitute of qualifications for it though i could not deny that my
talent was less respectable and might be less profitable than the
meanest of theirs my design in short was to imitate the
story-tellers of whom oriental travellers have told us and become an
itinerant novelist reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such
audiences as i could collect

either this said i is my vocation or i have been born in vain

the fortune-teller with a sly wink to the company proposed to take
me as an apprentice to one or other of his professions either of
which undoubtedly would have given full scope to whatever inventive
talent i might possess the bibliopolist spoke a few words in
opposition to my plan influenced partly i suspect by the jealousy
of authorship and partly by an apprehension that the viv√¢-voce
practice would become general among novelists to the infinite
detriment of the book trade

dreading a rejection i solicited the interest of the merry damsel

mirth cried i most aptly appropriating the words of l'allegro
to thee i sue mirth admit me of thy crew

let us indulge the poor youth said mirth with a kindness which
made me love her dearly though i was no such coxcomb as to
misinterpret her motives i have espied much promise in him true a
shadow sometimes flits across his brow but the sunshine is sure to
follow in a moment he is never guilty of a sad thought but a merry
one is twin-born with it we will take him with us and you shall see
that he will set us all a-laughing before we reach the camp-meeting at
stamford her voice silenced the scruples of the rest and gained me
admittance into the league according to the terms of which without a
community of goods or profits we were to lend each other all the aid
and avert all the harm that might be in our power

this affair settled a marvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe
of us manifesting itself characteristically in each individual the
old showman sitting down to his barrel-organ stirred up the souls of
the pigmy people with one of the quickest tunes in the music-book
tailors blacksmiths gentlemen and ladies all seemed to share in the
spirit of the occasion and the merry andrew played his part more
facetiously than ever nodding and winking particularly at me the
young foreigner flourished his fiddle-bow with a master's hand and
gave an inspiring echo to the showman's melody the bookish man and
the merry damsel started up simultaneously to dance the former
enacting the double shuffle in a style which everybody must have
witnessed ere election week was blotted out of time while the girl
setting her arms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist displayed
such light rapidity of foot and harmony of varying attitude and motion
that i could not conceive how she ever was to stop imagining at the
moment that nature had made her as the old showman had made his
puppets for no earthly purpose but to dance jigs the indian bellowed
forth a succession of most hideous outcries somewhat affrighting us
till we interpreted them as the war-song with which in imitation of
his ancestors he was prefacing the assault on stamford the conjurer
meanwhile sat demurely in a corner extracting a sly enjoyment from
the whole scene and like the facetious merry andrew directing his
queer glance particularly at me as for myself with great
exhilaration of fancy i began to arrange and color the incidents of a
tale wherewith i proposed to amuse an audience that very evening for
i saw that my associates were a little ashamed of me and that no time
was to be lost in obtaining a public acknowledgment of my abilities

come fellow-laborers at last said the old showman whom we had
elected president the shower is over and we must be doing our duty
by these poor souls at stamford

we'll come among them in procession with music and dancing cried
the merry damsel

accordingly for it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be
performed on foot we sallied joyously out of the wagon each of us
even the old gentleman in his white top-boots giving a great skip as
we came down the ladder above our heads there was such a glory of
sunshine and splendor of clouds and such brightness of verdure below
that as i modestly remarked at the time nature seemed to have washed
her face and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown in
honor of our confederation casting our eyes northward we beheld a
horseman approaching leisurely and splashing through the little puddle
on the stamford road onward he came sticking up in his saddle with
rigid perpendicularity a tall thin figure in rusty black whom the
showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be what his aspect
sufficiently indicated a travelling preacher of great fame among the
methodists what puzzled us was the fact that his face appeared turned
from instead of to the camp-meeting at stamford however as this
new votary of the wandering life drew near the little green space
where the guide-post and our wagon were situated my six
fellow-vagabonds and myself rushed forward and surrounded him crying
out with united voices what news what news from the camp-meeting at
stamford

the missionary looked down in surprise at as singular a knot of people
as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous auditors
indeed considering that we might all be classified under the general
head of vagabond there was great diversity of character among the
grave old showman the sly prophetic beggar the fiddling foreigner
and his merry damsel the smart bibliopolist the sombre indian and
myself the itinerant novelist a slender youth of eighteen i even
fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the iron gravity of
the preacher's mouth

good people answered he the camp-meeting is broke up

so saying the methodist minister switched his steed and rode
westward our union being thus nullified by the removal of its object
we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven the
fortune-teller giving a nod to all and a peculiar wink to me
departed on his northern tour chuckling within himself as he took the
stamford road the old showman and his literary coadjutor were already
tackling their horses to the wagon with a design to peregrinate
south-west along the sea-coast the foreigner and the merry damsel
took their laughing leave and pursued the eastern road which i had
that day trodden as they passed away the young man played a lively
strain and the girl's happy spirit broke into a dance and thus
dissolving as it were into sunbeams and gay music that pleasant
pair departed from my view finally with a pensive shadow thrown
across my mind yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late
companions i joined myself to the penobscot indian and set forth
toward the distant city




the white old maid


the moonbeams came through two deep and narrow windows and showed a
spacious chamber richly furnished in an antique fashion from one
lattice the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor the
ghostly light through the other slept upon a bed falling between the
heavy silken curtains and illuminating the face of a young man but
how quietly the slumberer lay how pale his features and how like a
shroud the sheet was wound about his frame yes it was a corpse in
its burial-clothes

suddenly the fixed features seemed to move with dark emotion strange
fantasy it was but the shadow of the fringed curtain waving betwixt
the dead face and the moonlight as the door of the chamber opened and
a girl stole softly to the bedside was there delusion in the
moonbeams or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of triumph as
she bent over the pale corpse pale as itself and pressed her living
lips to the cold ones of the dead as she drew back from that long
kiss her features writhed as if a proud heart were fighting with its
anguish again it seemed that the features of the corpse had moved
responsive to her own still an illusion the silken curtains had
waved a second time betwixt the dead face and the moonlight as another
fair young girl unclosed the door and glided ghostlike to the bedside
there the two maidens stood both beautiful with the pale beauty of
the dead between them but she who had first entered was proud and
stately and the other a soft and fragile thing

away cried the lofty one thou hadst him living the dead is
mine

thine returned the other shuddering well hast thou spoken the
dead is thine

the proud girl started and stared into her face with a ghastly look
but a wild-and mournful expression passed across the features of the
gentle one and weak and helpless she sank down on the bed her head
pillowed beside that of the corpse and her hair mingling with his dark
locks a creature of hope and joy the first draught of sorrow had
bewildered her

edith cried her rival

edith groaned as with a sudden compression of the heart and removing
her cheek from the dead youth's pillow she stood upright fearfully
encountering the eyes of the lofty girl

wilt thou betray me said the latter calmly

till the dead bid me speak i will be silent answered edith leave
us alone together go and live many years and then return and tell me
of thy life he too will be here then if thou tellest of sufferings
more than death we will both forgive thee

and what shall be the token asked the proud girl as if her heart
acknowledged a meaning in these wild words

this lock of hair said edith lifting one of the dark clustering
curls that lay heavily on the dead man's brow

the two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of the corpse and
appointed a day and hour far far in time to come for their next
meeting in that chamber the statelier girl gave one deep look at the
motionless countenance and departed yet turned again and trembled ere
she closed the door almost believing that her dead lover frowned upon
her and edith too was not her white form fading into the moonlight
scorning her own weakness she went forth and perceived that a negro
slave was waiting in the passage with a waxlight which he held
between her face and his own and regarded her as she thought with an
ugly expression of merriment lifting his torch on high the slave
lighted her down the staircase and undid the portal of the mansion
the young clergyman of the town had just ascended the steps and
bowing to the lady passed in without a word

years many years rolled on the world seemed new again so much
older was it grown since the night when those pale girls had clasped
their hands across the bosom of the corpse in the interval a lonely
woman had passed from youth to extreme age and was known by all the
town as the old maid in the winding-sheet a taint of insanity had
affected her whole life but so quiet sad and gentle so utterly free
from violence that she was suffered to pursue her harmless fantasies
unmolested by the world with whose business or pleasures she had
naught to do she dwelt alone and never came into the daylight except
to follow funerals whenever a corpse was borne along the street in
sunshine rain or snow whether a pompous train of the rich and proud
thronged after it or few and humble were the mourners behind them
came the lonely woman in a long white garment which the people called
her shroud she took no place among the kindred or the friends but
stood at the door to hear the funeral prayer and walked in the rear
of the procession as one whose earthly charge it was to haunt the
house of mourning and be the shadow of affliction and see that the
dead were duly buried so long had this been her custom that the
inhabitants of the town deemed her a part of every funeral as much as
the coffin-pall or the very corpse itself and augured ill of the
sinner's destiny unless the old maid in the winding-sheet came gliding
like a ghost behind once it is said she affrighted a bridal-party
with her pale presence appearing suddenly in the illuminated hall
just as the priest was uniting a false maid to a wealthy man before
her lover had been dead a year evil was the omen to that marriage
sometimes she stole forth by moonlight and visited the graves of
venerable integrity and wedded love and virgin innocence and every
spot where the ashes of a kind and faithful heart were mouldering
over the hillocks of those favored dead would she stretch out her arms
with a gesture as if she were scattering seeds and many believed that
she brought them from the garden of paradise for the graves which she
had visited were green beneath the snow and covered with sweet flowers
from april to november her blessing was better than a holy verse upon
the tombstone thus wore away her long sad peaceful and fantastic
life till few were so old as she and the people of later generations
wondered how the dead had ever been buried or mourners had endured
their grief without the old maid in the winding-sheet still years
went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to
her own festival of death

one afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business
and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the
church-spire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow
the scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade
between the high brick buildings here were pompous merchants in white
wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of sea-captains the foreign
garb and air of spanish creoles and the disdainful port of natives of
old england all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two
back-settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had
never sounded sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an
embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in high-heeled shoes and
courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the
gentlemen the life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far
from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement
surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather
deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it its site would have
been suitably occupied by a magnificent exchange or a brick block
lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might
have made a noble tavern with the king's arms swinging before it and
guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude but owing
to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been
long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the
stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town

such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that
have been described was observed at a distance down the street

i espy a strange sail yonder remarked a liverpool captain that
woman in the long white garment

the sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others
who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had
attracted his notice almost immediately the various topics of
conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this
unwonted occurrence

can there be a funeral so late this afternoon inquired some

they looked for the signs of death at every door the sexton the
hearse the assemblage of black-clad relatives all that makes up the
woeful pomp of funerals they raised their eyes also to the sun-gilt
spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its
bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in
the light of day but none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to
its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except
the apparition of the old maid in the winding-sheet

what may this portend asked each man of his neighbor

all smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in
their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were
prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose
presence had always been associated with death and woe what a comet
is to the earth was that sad woman to the town still she moved on
while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud
and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave
against them it was a long loose robe of spotless purity its wearer
appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward
without the unsteady pace of extreme age at one point of her course a
little rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms toward
the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips
she made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of
no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awestruck
rather than affrighted while the old maid passed on perhaps her
garment might have been polluted even by an infant's touch perhaps
her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within the year

she is but a shadow whispered the superstitious the child put
forth his arms and could not grasp her robe

the wonder was increased when the old maid passed beneath the porch of
the deserted mansion ascended the moss-covered steps lifted the iron
knocker and gave three raps the people could only conjecture that
some old remembrance troubling her bewildered brain had impelled the
poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth all gone from
their home long since and for ever unless their ghosts still haunted
it fit company for the old maid in the winding-sheet

an elderly man approached the steps and reverently uncovering his
gray locks essayed to explain the matter

none madam said he have dwelt in this house these fifteen years
agone no not since the death of old colonel fenwicke whose funeral
you may remember to have followed his heirs being ill-agreed among
themselves have let the mansion-house go to ruin

the old maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture of one hand and
a finger of the other upon her lip appearing more shadow-like than
ever in the obscurity of the porch but again she lifted the hammer
and gave this time a single rap could it be that a footstep was now
heard coming down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived
to have been so long untenanted slowly feebly yet heavily like the
pace of an aged and infirm person the step approached more distinct
on every downward stair till it reached the portal the bar fell on
the inside the door was opened one upward glance toward the
church-spire whence the sunshine had just faded was the last that
the people saw of the old maid in the winding-sheet

who undid the door asked many

this question owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch no one
could satisfactorily answer two or three aged men while protesting
against an inference which might be drawn affirmed that the person
within was a negro and bore a singular resemblance to old c√¶sar
formerly a slave in the house but freed by death some thirty years
before

her summons has waked up a servant of the old family said one half
seriously

let us wait here replied another more guests will knock at the
door anon but the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open

twilight had overspread the town before the crowd began to separate or
the comments on this incident were exhausted one after another was
wending his way homeward when a coach no common spectacle in those
days drove slowly into the street it was an old-fashioned equipage
hanging close to the ground with arms on the panels a footman behind
and a grave corpulent coachman seated high in front the whole giving
an idea of solemn state and dignity there was something awful in the
heavy rumbling of the wheels

the coach rolled down the street till coming to the gateway of the
deserted mansion it drew up and the footman sprang to the ground

whose grand coach is this asked a very inquisitive body

the footman made no reply but ascended the steps of the old house
gave three taps with the iron hammer and returned to open the coach
door an old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in that day
examined the shield of arms on the panel

azure a lion's head erased between three flowers de luce said he
then whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged
the last inheritor of its honors was recently dead after a long
residence amid the splendor of the british court where his birth and
wealth had given him no mean station he left no child continued
the herald and these arms being in a lozenge betoken that the
coach appertains to his widow

further disclosures perhaps might have been made had not the speaker
been suddenly struck dumb by the stern eye of an ancient lady who
thrust forth her head from the coach preparing to descend as she
emerged the people saw that her dress was magnificent and her figure
dignified in spite of age and infirmity a stately ruin but with a
look at once of pride and wretchedness her strong and rigid features
had an awe about them unlike that of the white old maid but as of
something evil she passed up the steps leaning on a gold-headed
cane the door swung open as she ascended and the light of a torch
glittered on the embroidery of her dress and gleamed on the pillars of
the porch after a momentary pause a glance backward and then a
desperate effort she went in

the decipherer of the coat-of-arms had ventured up the lower step
and shrinking back immediately pale and tremulous affirmed that the
torch was held by the very image of old c√¶sar

but such a hideous grin added he was never seen on the face of
mortal man black or white it will haunt me till my dying-day

meantime the coach had wheeled round with a prodigious clatter on the
pavement and rumbled up the street disappearing in the twilight
while the ear still tracked its course scarcely was it gone when the
people began to question whether the coach and attendants the ancient
lady the spectre of old c√¶sar and the old maid herself were not all a
strangely-combined delusion with some dark purport in its mystery the
whole town was astir so that instead of dispersing the crowd
continually increased and stood gazing up at the windows of the
mansion now silvered by the brightening moon the elders glad to
indulge the narrative propensity of age told of the long-faded
splendor of the family the entertainments they had given and the
guests the greatest of the land and even titled and noble ones from
abroad who had passed beneath that portal these graphic
reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they
referred so strong was the impression on some of the more imaginative
hearers that two or three were seized with trembling fits at one and
the same moment protesting that they had distinctly heard three other
raps of the iron knocker

impossible exclaimed others see the moon shines beneath the
porch and shows every part of it except in the narrow shade of that
pillar there is no one there

did not the door open whispered one of these fanciful persons

didst thou see it too said his companion in a startled tone

but the general sentiment was opposed to the idea that a third
visitant had made application at the door of the deserted house a
few however adhered to this new marvel and even declared that a red
gleam like that of a torch had shone through the great front window
as if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase this too was
pronounced a mere fantasy

but at once the whole multitude started and each man beheld his own
terror painted in the faces of all the rest

what an awful thing is this cried they

a shriek too fearfully distinct for doubt had been heard within the
mansion breaking forth suddenly and succeeded by a deep stillness as
if a heart had burst in giving it utterance the people knew not
whether to fly from the very sight of the house or to rush trembling
in and search out the strange mystery amid their confusion and
affright they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their
clergyman a venerable patriarch and equally a saint who had taught
them and their fathers the way to heaven for more than the space of an
ordinary lifetime he was a reverend figure with long white hair upon
his shoulders a white beard upon his breast and a back so bent over
his staff that he seemed to be looking downward continually as if to
choose a proper grave for his weary frame it was some time before the
good old man being deaf and of impaired intellect could be made to
comprehend such portions of the affair as were comprehensible at all
but when possessed of the facts his energies assumed unexpected
vigor

verily said the old gentleman it will be fitting that i enter the
mansion-house of the worthy colonel fenwicke lest any harm should
have befallen that true christian woman whom ye call the old maid in
the winding-sheet

behold then the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the
mansion with a torch-bearer behind him it was the elderly man who had
spoken to the old maid and the same who had afterward explained the
shield of arms and recognized the features of the negro like their
predecessors they gave three raps with the iron hammer

old c√¶sar cometh not observed the priest well i wot he no longer
doth service in this mansion

assuredly then it was something worse in old c√¶sar's likeness
said the other adventurer

be it as god wills answered the clergyman see my strength
though it be much decayed hath sufficed to open this heavy door let
us enter and pass up the staircase

here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very
old man's mind as they ascended the wide flight of stairs the aged
clergyman appeared to move with caution occasionally standing aside
and oftener bending his head as it were in salutation thus
practising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng
reaching the head of the staircase he looked around with sad and
solemn benignity laid aside his staff bared his hoary locks and was
evidently on the point of commencing a prayer

reverend sir said his attendant who conceived this a very suitable
prelude to their further search would it not be well that the people
join with us in prayer

well-a-day cried the old clergyman staring strangely around him
art thou here with me and none other verily past times were
present to me and i deemed that i was to make a funeral prayer as
many a time heretofore from the head of this staircase of a truth i
saw the shades of many that are gone yea i have prayed at their
burials one after another and the old maid in the winding-sheet hath
seen them to their graves

being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose he took his
staff and struck forcibly on the floor till there came an echo from
each deserted chamber but no menial to answer their summons they
therefore walked along the passage and again paused opposite to the
great front window through which was seen the crowd in the shadow and
partial moonlight of the street beneath on their right hand was the
open door of a chamber and a closed one on their left

the clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter

within that chamber observed he a whole lifetime since did i sit
by the death-bed of a goodly young man who being now at the last
gasp apparently there was some powerful excitement in the ideas
which had now flashed across his mind he snatched the torch from his
companion's hand and threw open the door with such sudden violence
that the flame was extinguished leaving them no other light than the
moonbeams which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber it
was sufficient to discover all that could be known in a high-backed
oaken arm-chair upright with her hands clasped across her breast and
her head thrown back sat the old maid in the winding-sheet the
stately dame had fallen on her knees with her forehead on the holy
knees of the old maid one hand upon the floor and the other pressed
convulsively against her heart it clutched a lock of hair once
sable now discolored with a greenish mould

as the priest and layman advanced into the chamber the old maid's
features assumed such a semblance of shifting expression that they
trusted to hear the whole mystery explained by a single word but it
was only the shadow of a tattered curtain waving betwixt the dead face
and the moonlight

both dead said the venerable man then who shall divulge the
secret methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind like the light and
shadow across the old maid's face and now tis gone




peter goldthwaite's treasure


and so peter you won't even consider of the business said mr
john brown buttoning his surtout over the snug rotundity of his
person and drawing on his gloves you positively refuse to let me
have this crazy old house and the land under and adjoining at the
price named

neither at that nor treble the sum responded the gaunt grizzled
and threadbare peter goldthwaite the fact is mr brown you must
find another site for your brick block and be content to leave my
estate with the present owner next summer i intend to put a splendid
new mansion over the cellar of the old house

pho peter cried mr brown as he opened the kitchen door content
yourself with building castles in the air where house-lots are
cheaper than on earth to say nothing of the cost of bricks and
mortar such foundations are solid enough for your edifices while
this underneath us is just the thing for mine and so we may both be
suited what say you again

precisely what i said before mr brown answered peter goldthwaite
and as for castles in the air mine may not be as magnificent as
that sort of architecture but perhaps as substantial mr brown as
the very respectable brick block with dry-goods stores tailors shops
and banking-rooms on the lower floor and lawyers offices in the
second story which you are so anxious to substitute

and the cost peter eh said mr brown as he withdrew in something
of a pet that i suppose will be provided for off-hand by drawing a
check on bubble bank

john brown and peter goldthwaite had been jointly known to the
commercial world between twenty and thirty years before under the firm
of goldthwaite brown which copartnership however was speedily
dissolved by the natural incongruity of its constituent parts since
that event john brown with exactly the qualities of a thousand other
john browns and by just such plodding methods as they used had
prospered wonderfully and become one of the wealthiest john browns on
earth peter goldthwaite on the contrary after innumerable schemes
which ought to have collected all the coin and paper currency of the
country into his coffers was as needy a gentleman as ever wore a
patch upon his elbow the contrast between him and his former partner
may be briefly marked for brown never reckoned upon luck yet always
had it while peter made luck the main condition of his projects and
always missed it while the means held out his speculations had been
magnificent but were chiefly confined of late years to such small
business as adventures in the lottery once he had gone on a
gold-gathering expedition somewhere to the south and ingeniously
contrived to empty his pockets more thoroughly than ever while
others doubtless were filling theirs with native bullion by the
handful more recently he had expended a legacy of a thousand or two
of dollars in purchasing mexican scrip and thereby became the
proprietor of a province which however so far as peter could find
out was situated where he might have had an empire for the same
money in the clouds from a search after this valuable real estate
peter returned so gaunt and threadbare that on reaching new england
the scarecrows in the corn-fields beckoned to him as he passed by
they did but flutter in the wind quoth peter goldthwaite no
peter they beckoned for the scarecrows knew their brother

at the period of our story his whole visible income would not have
paid the tax of the old mansion in which we find him it was one of
those rusty moss-grown many-peaked wooden houses which are scattered
about the streets of our elder towns with a beetle-browed second
story projecting over the foundation as if it frowned at the novelty
around it this old paternal edifice needy as he was and though
being centrally situated on the principal street of the town it would
have brought him a handsome sum the sagacious peter had his own
reasons for never parting with either by auction or private sale
there seemed indeed to be a fatality that connected him with his
birthplace for often as he had stood on the verge of ruin and
standing there even now he had not yet taken the step beyond it which
would have compelled him to surrender the house to his creditors so
here he dwelt with bad luck till good should come

here then in his kitchen the only room where a spark of fire took
off the chill of a november evening poor peter goldthwaite had just
been visited by his rich old partner at the close of their interview
peter with rather a mortified look glanced downward at his dress
parts of which appeared as ancient as the days of goldthwaite brown
his upper garment was a mixed surtout woefully faded and patched
with newer stuff on each elbow beneath this he wore a threadbare
black coat some of the silk buttons of which had been replaced with
others of a different pattern and lastly though he lacked not a
pair of gray pantaloons they were very shabby ones and had been
partially turned brown by the frequent toasting of peter's shins
before a scanty fire peter's person was in keeping with his goodly
apparel gray-headed hollow-eyed pale-cheeked and lean-bodied he
was the perfect picture of a man who had fed on windy schemes and
empty hopes till he could neither live on such unwholesome trash nor
stomach more substantial food but withal this peter goldthwaite
crack-brained simpleton as perhaps he was might have cut a very
brilliant figure in the world had he employed his imagination in the
airy business of poetry instead of making it a demon of mischief in
mercantile pursuits after all he was no bad fellow but as harmless
as a child and as honest and honorable and as much of the gentleman
which nature meant him for as an irregular life and depressed
circumstances will permit any man to be

as peter stood on the uneven bricks of his hearth looking round at the
disconsolate old kitchen his eyes began to kindle with the
illumination of an enthusiasm that never long deserted him he raised
his hand clenched it and smote it energetically against the smoky
panel over the fireplace

the time is come said he with such a treasure at command it were
folly to be a poor man any longer tomorrow morning i will begin with
the garret nor desist till i have torn the house down

deep in the chimney-corner like a witch in a dark cavern sat a
little old woman mending one of the two pairs of stockings wherewith
peter goldthwaite kept his toes from being frost-bitten as the feet
were ragged past all darning she had cut pieces out of a cast-off
flannel petticoat to make new soles tabitha porter was an old maid
upward of sixty years of age fifty-five of which she had sat in that
same chimney-corner such being the length of time since peter's
grandfather had taken her from the almshouse she had no friend but
peter nor peter any friend but tabitha so long as peter might have a
shelter for his own head tabitha would know where to shelter hers
or being homeless elsewhere she would take her master by the hand
and bring him to her native home the almshouse should it ever be
necessary she loved him well enough to feed him with her last morsel
and clothe him with her under-petticoat but tabitha was a queer old
woman and though never infected with peter's flightiness had become
so accustomed to his freaks and follies that she viewed them all as
matters of course hearing him threaten to tear the house down she
looked quietly up from her work

best leave the kitchen till the last mr peter said she

the sooner we have it all down the better said peter goldthwaite
i am tired to death of living in this cold dark windy smoky
creaking groaning dismal old house i shall feel like a younger man
when we get into my splendid brick mansion as please heaven we
shall by this time next autumn you shall have a room on the sunny
side old tabby finished and furnished as best may suit your own
notions

i should like it pretty much such a room as this kitchen answered
tabitha it will never be like home to me till the chimney-corner
gets as black with smoke as this and that won't be these hundred
years how much do you mean to lay out on the house mr peter

what is that to the purpose exclaimed peter loftily did not my
great-grand-uncle peter goldthwaite who died seventy years ago and
whose namesake i am leave treasure enough to build twenty such

i can't say but he did mr peter said tabitha threading her
needle

tabitha well understood that peter had reference to an immense hoard
of the precious metals which was said to exist somewhere in the cellar
or walls or under the floors or in some concealed closet or other
out-of-the-way nook of the old house this wealth according to
tradition had been accumulated by a former peter goldthwaite whose
character seems to have borne a remarkable similitude to that of the
peter of our story like him he was a wild projector seeking to heap
up gold by the bushel and the cart-load instead of scraping it
together coin by coin like peter the second too his projects had
almost invariably failed and but for the magnificent success of the
final one would have left him with hardly a coat and pair of breeches
to his gaunt and grizzled person reports were various as to the
nature of his fortunate speculation one intimating that the ancient
peter had made the gold by alchemy another that he had conjured it
out of people's pockets by the black art and a third still more
unaccountable that the devil had given him free access to the old
provincial treasury it was affirmed however that some secret
impediment had debarred him from the enjoyment of his riches and that
he had a motive for concealing them from his heir or at any rate
had died without disclosing the place of deposit the present peter's
father had faith enough in the story to cause the cellar to be dug
over peter himself chose to consider the legend as an indisputable
truth and amid his many troubles had this one consolation that
should all other resources fail he might build up his fortunes by
tearing his house down yet unless he felt a lurking distrust of the
golden tale it is difficult to account for his permitting the
paternal roof to stand so long since he had never yet seen the moment
when his predecessor's treasure would not have found plenty of room in
his own strong-box but now was the crisis should he delay the search
a little longer the house would pass from the lineal heir and with
it the vast heap of gold to remain in its burial-place till the ruin
of the aged walls should discover it to strangers of a future
generation

yes cried peter goldthwaite again to-morrow i will set about
it

the deeper he looked at the matter the more certain of success grew
peter his spirits were naturally so elastic that even now in the
blasted autumn of his age he could often compete with the springtime
gayety of other people enlivened by his brightening prospects he
began to caper about the kitchen like a hobgoblin with the queerest
antics of his lean limbs and gesticulations of his starved features
nay in the exuberance of his feelings he seized both of tabitha's
hands and danced the old lady across the floor till the oddity of her
rheumatic motions set him into a roar of laughter which was echoed
back from the rooms and chambers as if peter goldthwaite were
laughing in every one finally he bounded upward almost out of
sight into the smoke that clouded the roof of the kitchen and
alighting safely on the floor again endeavored to resume his
customary gravity

to-morrow at sunrise he repeated taking his lamp to retire to
bed i'll see whether this treasure be hid in the wall of the
garret

and as we're out of wood mr peter said tabitha puffing and
panting with her late gymnastics as fast as you tear the house down
i'll make a fire with the pieces

gorgeous that night were the dreams of peter goldthwaite at one time
he was turning a ponderous key in an iron door not unlike the door of
a sepulchre but which being opened disclosed a vault heaped up with
gold coin as plentifully as golden corn in a granary there were
chased goblets also and tureens salvers dinner-dishes and
dish-covers of gold or silver-gilt besides chains and other jewels
incalculably rich though tarnished with the damps of the vault for
of all the wealth that was irrevocably lost to man whether buried in
the earth or sunken in the sea peter goldthwaite had found it in this
one treasure-place anon he had returned to the old house as poor as
ever and was received at the door by the gaunt and grizzled figure of
a man whom he might have mistaken for himself only that his garments
were of a much elder fashion but the house without losing its former
aspect had been changed into a palace of the precious metals the
floors walls and ceilings were of burnished silver the doors the
window-frames the cornices the balustrades and the steps of the
staircase of pure gold and silver with gold bottoms were the
chairs and gold standing on silver legs the high chests of drawers
and silver the bedsteads with blankets of woven gold and sheets of
silver tissue the house had evidently been transmuted by a single
touch for it retained all the marks that peter remembered but in
gold or silver instead of wood and the initials of his name which
when a boy he had cut in the wooden door-post remained as deep in the
pillar of gold a happy man would have been peter goldthwaite except
for a certain ocular deception which whenever he glanced backward
caused the house to darken from its glittering magnificence into the
sordid gloom of yesterday

up betimes rose peter seized an axe hammer and saw which he had
placed by his bedside and hied him to the garret it was but scantily
lighted up as yet by the frosty fragments of a sunbeam which began to
glimmer through the almost opaque bull-eyes of the window a moralizer
might find abundant themes for his speculative and impracticable
wisdom in a garret there is the limbo of departed fashions aged
trifles of a day and whatever was valuable only to one generation of
men and which passed to the garret when that generation passed to the
grave not for safekeeping but to be out of the way peter saw piles
of yellow and musty account-books in parchment covers wherein
creditors long dead and buried had written the names of dead and
buried debtors in ink now so faded that their moss-grown tombstones
were more legible he found old moth-eaten garments all in rags and
tatters or peter would have put them on here was a naked and rusty
sword not a sword of service but a gentleman's small french
rapier which had never left its scabbard till it lost it here were
canes of twenty different sorts but no gold-headed ones and
shoebuckles of various pattern and material but not silver nor set
with precious stones here was a large box full of shoes with high
heels and peaked toes here on a shelf were a multitude of phials
half filled with old apothecary's stuff which when the other half had
done its business on peter's ancestors had been brought hither from
the death-chamber here not to give a longer inventory of articles
that will never be put up at auction was the fragment of a
full-length looking-glass which by the dust and dimness of its surface
made the picture of these old things look older than the reality when
peter not knowing that there was a mirror there caught the faint
traces of his own figure he partly imagined that the former peter
goldthwaite had come back either to assist or impede his search for
the hidden wealth and at that moment a strange notion glimmered
through his brain that he was the identical peter who had concealed
the gold and ought to know whereabout it lay this however he had
unaccountably forgotten

well mr peter cried tabitha on the garret stairs have you torn
the house down enough to heat the teakettle

not yet old tabby answered peter but that's soon done as you
shall see with the word in his mouth he uplifted the axe and laid
about him so vigorously that the dust flew the boards crashed and in
a twinkling the old woman had an apron full of broken rubbish

we shall get our winter's wood cheap quoth tabitha

the good work being thus commenced peter beat down all before him
smiting and hewing at the joints and timbers unclenching spike-nails
ripping and tearing away boards with a tremendous racket from morning
till night he took care however to leave the outside shell of the
house untouched so that the neighbors might not suspect what was
going on

never in any of his vagaries though each had made him happy while it
lasted had peter been happier than now perhaps after all there was
something in peter goldthwaite's turn of mind which brought him an
inward recompense for all the external evil that it caused if he were
poor ill-clad even hungry and exposed as it were to be utterly
annihilated by a precipice of impending ruin yet only his body
remained in these miserable circumstances while his aspiring soul
enjoyed the sunshine of a bright futurity it was his nature to be
always young and the tendency of his mode of life to keep him so
gray hairs were nothing no nor wrinkles nor infirmity he might look
old indeed and be somewhat disagreeably connected with a gaunt old
figure much the worse for wear but the true the essential peter was
a young man of high hopes just entering on the world at the kindling
of each new fire his burnt-out youth rose afresh from the old embers
and ashes it rose exulting now having lived thus long not too long
but just to the right age a susceptible bachelor with warm and tender
dreams he resolved so soon as the hidden gold should flash to light
to go a-wooing and win the love of the fairest maid in town what
heart could resist him happy peter goldthwaite

every evening as peter had long absented himself from his former
lounging-places at insurance offices news-rooms and book-stores and
as the honor of his company was seldom requested in private
circles he and tabitha used to sit down sociably by the kitchen
hearth this was always heaped plentifully with the rubbish of his
day's labor as the foundation of the fire there would be a
goodly-sized back-log of red oak which after being sheltered from
rain or damp above a century still hissed with the heat and distilled
streams of water from each end as if the tree had been cut down
within a week or two next there were large sticks sound black and
heavy which had lost the principle of decay and were indestructible
except by fire wherein they glowed like red-hot bars of iron on this
solid basis tabitha would rear a lighter structure composed of the
splinters of door-panels ornamented mouldings and such quick
combustibles which caught like straw and threw a brilliant blaze high
up the spacious flue making its sooty sides visible almost to the
chimney-top meantime the gloom of the old kitchen would be chased
out of the cobwebbed corners and away from the dusky cross-beams
overhead and driven nobody could tell whither while peter smiled
like a gladsome man and tabitha seemed a picture of comfortable age
all this of course was but an emblem of the bright fortune which the
destruction of the house would shed upon its occupants

while the dry pine was flaming and crackling like an irregular
discharge of fairy-musketry peter sat looking and listening in a
pleasant state of excitement but when the brief blaze and uproar were
succeeded by the dark-red glow the substantial heat and the deep
singing sound which were to last throughout the evening his humor
became talkative one night the hundredth time he teased tabitha to
tell him something new about his great-granduncle

you have been sitting in that chimney-corner fifty-five years old
tabby and must have heard many a tradition about him said peter
did not you tell me that when you first came to the house there was
an old woman sitting where you sit now who had been housekeeper to the
famous peter goldthwaite

so there was mr peter answered tabitha and she was near about a
hundred years old she used to say that she and old peter goldthwaite
had often spent a sociable evening by the kitchen fire pretty much as
you and i are doing now mr peter

the old fellow must have resembled me in more points than one said
peter complacently or he never would have grown so rich but
methinks he might have invested the money better than he did no
interest nothing but good security and the house to be torn down to
come at it what made him hide it so snug tabby

because he could not spend it said tabitha for as often as he
went to unlock the chest the old scratch came behind and caught his
arm the money they say was paid peter out of his purse and he
wanted peter to give him a deed of this house and land which peter
swore he would not do

just as i swore to john brown my old partner remarked peter but
this is all nonsense tabby i don't believe the story

well it may not be just the truth said tabitha for some folks
say that peter did make over the house to the old scratch and that's
the reason it has always been so unlucky to them that lived in it and
as soon as peter had given him the deed the chest flew open and peter
caught up a handful of the gold but lo and behold there was nothing
in his fist but a parcel of old rags

hold your tongue you silly old tabby cried peter in great wrath
they were as good golden guineas as ever bore the effigies of the
king of england it seems as if i could recollect the whole
circumstance and how i or old peter or whoever it was thrust in my
hand or his hand and drew it out all of a blaze with gold old rags
indeed

but it was not an old woman's legend that would discourage peter
goldthwaite all night long he slept among pleasant dreams and awoke
at daylight with a joyous throb of the heart which few are fortunate
enough to feel beyond their boyhood day after day he labored hard
without wasting a moment except at meal-times when tabitha summoned
him to the pork and cabbage or such other sustenance as she had
picked up or providence had sent them being a truly pious man peter
never failed to ask a blessing if the food were none of the best
then so much the more earnestly as it was more needed nor to return
thanks if the dinner had been scanty yet for the good appetite which
was better than a sick stomach at a feast then did he hurry back to
his toil and in a moment was lost to sight in a cloud of dust from
the old walls though sufficiently perceptible to the ear by the
clatter which he raised in the midst of it

how enviable is the consciousness of being usefully employed nothing
troubled peter or nothing but those phantoms of the mind which seem
like vague recollections yet have also the aspect of presentiments
he often paused with his axe uplifted in the air and said to himself
peter goldthwaite did you never strike this blow before or peter
what need of tearing the whole house down think a little while and
you will remember where the gold is hidden days and weeks passed on
however without any remarkable discovery sometimes indeed a lean
gray rat peeped forth at the lean gray man wondering what devil had
got into the old house which had always been so peaceable till now
and occasionally peter sympathized with the sorrows of a female mouse
who had brought five or six pretty little soft and delicate young
ones into the world just in time to see them crushed by its ruin but
as yet no treasure

by this time peter being as determined as fate and as diligent as
time had made an end with the uppermost regions and got down to the
second story where he was busy in one of the front chambers it had
formerly been the state-bedchamber and was honored by tradition as
the sleeping-apartment of governor dudley and many other eminent
guests the furniture was gone there were remnants of faded and
tattered paper-hangings but larger spaces of bare wall ornamented
with charcoal sketches chiefly of people's heads in profile these
being specimens of peter's youthful genius it went more to his heart
to obliterate them than if they had been pictures on a church wall by
michael angelo one sketch however and that the best one affected
him differently it represented a ragged man partly supporting himself
on a spade and bending his lean body over a hole in the earth with
one hand extended to grasp something that he had found but close
behind him with a fiendish laugh on his features appeared a figure
with horns a tufted tail and a cloven hoof

avaunt satan cried peter the man shall have his gold uplifting
his axe he hit the horned gentleman such a blow on the head as not
only demolished him but the treasure-seeker also and caused the
whole scene to vanish like magic moreover his axe broke quite
through the plaster and laths and discovered a cavity

mercy on us mr peter are you quarrelling with the old scratch
said tabitha who was seeking some fuel to put under the dinner-pot

without answering the old woman peter broke down a further space of
the wall and laid open a small closet or cupboard on one side of the
fireplace about breast-high from the ground it contained nothing but
a brass lamp covered with verdigris and a dusty piece of parchment
while peter inspected the latter tabitha seized the lamp and began to
rub it with her apron

there is no use in rubbing it tabitha said peter it is not
aladdin's lamp though i take it to be a token of as much luck look
here tabby

tabitha took the parchment and held it close to her nose which was
saddled with a pair of iron-bound spectacles but no sooner had she
begun to puzzle over it than she burst into a chuckling laugh holding
both her hands against her sides

you can't make a fool of the old woman cried she this is your own
handwriting mr peter the same as in the letter you sent me from
mexico

there is certainly a considerable resemblance said peter again
examining the parchment but you know yourself tabby that this
closet must have been plastered up before you came to the house or i
came into the world no this is old peter goldthwaite's writing
these columns of pounds shillings and pence are his figures denoting
the amount of the treasure and this at the bottom is doubtless a
reference to the place of concealment but the ink has either faded or
peeled off so that it is absolutely illegible what a pity

well this lamp is as good as new that's some comfort said
tabitha

a lamp thought peter that indicates light on my researches

for the present peter felt more inclined to ponder on this discovery
than to resume his labors after tabitha had gone down stairs he stood
poring over the parchment at one of the front windows which was so
obscured with dust that the sun could barely throw an uncertain shadow
of the casement across the floor peter forced it open and looked out
upon the great street of the town while the sun looked in at his old
house the air though mild and even warm thrilled peter as with a
dash of water

it was the first day of the january thaw the snow lay deep upon the
housetops but was rapidly dissolving into millions of water-drops
which sparkled downward through the sunshine with the noise of a
summer shower beneath the eaves along the street the trodden snow was
as hard and solid as a pavement of white marble and had not yet grown
moist in the spring-like temperature but when peter thrust forth his
head he saw that the inhabitants if not the town were already
thawed out by this warm day after two or three weeks of winter
weather it gladdened him a gladness with a sigh breathing through
it to see the stream of ladies gliding along the slippery sidewalks
with their red cheeks set off by quilted hoods boas and sable capes
like roses amidst a new kind of foliage the sleigh bells jingled to
and fro continually sometimes announcing the arrival of a sleigh from
vermont laden with the frozen bodies of porkers or sheep and perhaps
a deer or two sometimes of a regular marketman with chickens geese
and turkeys comprising the whole colony of a barn-yard and
sometimes of a farmer and his dame who had come to town partly for
the ride partly to go a-shopping and partly for the sale of some eggs
and butter this couple rode in an old-fashioned square sleigh which
had served them twenty winters and stood twenty summers in the sun
beside their door now a gentleman and lady skimmed the snow in an
elegant car shaped somewhat like a cockle-shell now a stage-sleigh
with its cloth curtains thrust aside to admit the sun dashed rapidly
down the street whirling in and out among the vehicles that
obstructed its passage now came round a corner the similitude of
noah's ark on runners being an immense open sleigh with seats for
fifty people and drawn by a dozen horses this spacious receptacle was
populous with merry maids and merry bachelors merry girls and boys
and merry old folks all alive with fun and grinning to the full width
of their mouths they kept up a buzz of babbling voices and low
laughter and sometimes burst into a deep joyous shout which the
spectators answered with three cheers while a gang of roguish boys
let drive their snow-balls right among the pleasure-party the sleigh
passed on and when concealed by a bend of the street was still
audible by a distant cry of merriment

never had peter beheld a livelier scene than was constituted by all
these accessories the bright sun the flashing water-drops the
gleaming snow the cheerful multitude the variety of rapid vehicles
and the jingle-jangle of merry bells which made the heart dance to
their music nothing dismal was to be seen except that peaked piece of
antiquity peter goldthwaite's house which might well look sad
externally since such a terrible consumption was preying on its
insides and peter's gaunt figure half visible in the projecting
second story was worthy of his house

peter how goes it friend peter cried a voice across the street as
peter was drawing in his head look out here peter

peter looked and saw his old partner mr john brown on the opposite
sidewalk portly and comfortable with his furred cloak thrown open
disclosing a handsome surtout beneath his voice had directed the
attention of the whole town to peter goldthwaite's window and to the
dusty scarecrow which appeared at it

i say peter cried mr brown again what the devil are you about
there that i hear such a racket whenever i pass by you are repairing
the old house i suppose making a new one of it eh

too late for that i am afraid mr brown replied peter if i make
it new it will be new inside and out from the cellar upward

had not you better let me take the job said mr brown
significantly

not yet answered peter hastily shutting the window for ever since
he had been in search of the treasure he hated to have people stare at
him

as he drew back ashamed of his outward poverty yet proud of the
secret wealth within his grasp a haughty smile shone out on peter's
visage with precisely the effect of the dim sunbeams in the squalid
chamber he endeavored to assume such a mien as his ancestor had
probably worn when he gloried in the building of a strong house for a
home to many generations of his posterity but the chamber was very
dark to his snow-dazzled eyes and very dismal too in contrast with
the living scene that he had just looked upon his brief glimpse into
the street had given him a forcible impression of the manner in which
the world kept itself cheerful and prosperous by social pleasures and
an intercourse of business while he in seclusion was pursuing an
object that might possibly be a phantasm by a method which most people
would call madness it is one great advantage of a gregarious mode of
life that each person rectifies his mind by other minds and squares
his conduct to that of his neighbors so as seldom to be lost in
eccentricity peter goldthwaite had exposed himself to this influence
by merely looking out of the window for a while he doubted whether
there were any hidden chest of gold and in that case whether it was
so exceedingly wise to tear the house down only to be convinced of its
non-existence

but this was momentary peter the destroyer resumed the task which
fate had assigned him nor faltered again till it was accomplished in
the course of his search he met with many things that are usually
found in the ruins of an old house and also with some that are not
what seemed most to the purpose was a rusty key which had been thrust
into a chink of the wall with a wooden label appended to the handle
bearing the initials pg another singular discovery was that of a
bottle of wine walled up in an old oven a tradition ran in the family
that peter's grandfather a jovial officer in the old french war had
set aside many dozens of the precious liquor for the benefit of topers
then unborn peter needed no cordial to sustain his hopes and
therefore kept the wine to gladden his success many half-pence did he
pick up that had been lost through the cracks of the floor and some
few spanish coins and the half of a broken sixpence which had
doubtless been a love-token there was likewise a silver coronation
medal of george iii but old peter goldthwaite's strong-box fled from
one dark corner to another or otherwise eluded the second peter's
clutches till should he seek much farther he must burrow into the
earth

we will not follow him in his triumphant progress step by step
suffice it that peter worked like a steam-engine and finished in that
one winter the job which all the former inhabitants of the house with
time and the elements to aid them had only half done in a century
except the kitchen every room and chamber was now gutted the house
was nothing but a shell the apparition of a house as unreal as the
painted edifices of a theatre it was like the perfect rind of a great
cheese in which a mouse had dwelt and nibbled till it was a cheese no
more and peter was the mouse

what peter had torn down tabitha had burnt up for she wisely
considered that without a house they should need no wood to warm it
and therefore economy was nonsense thus the whole house might be said
to have dissolved in smoke and flown up among the clouds through the
great black flue of the kitchen chimney it was an admirable parallel
to the feat of the man who jumped down his own throat

on the night between the last day of winter and the first of spring
every chink and cranny had been ransacked except within the precincts
of the kitchen this fated evening was an ugly one a snow-storm had
set in some hours before and was still driven and tossed about the
atmosphere by a real hurricane which fought against the house as if
the prince of the air in person were putting the final stroke to
peter's labors the framework being so much weakened and the inward
props removed it would have been no marvel if in some stronger
wrestle of the blast the rotten walls of the edifice and all the
peaked roofs had come crashing down upon the owner's head he
however was careless of the peril but as wild and restless as the
night itself or as the flame that quivered up the chimney at each
roar of the tempestuous wind

the wine tabitha he cried my grandfather's rich old wine we
will drink it now

tabitha arose from her smoke-blackened bench in the chimney-corner and
placed the bottle before peter close beside the old brass lamp which
had likewise been the prize of his researches peter held it before
his eyes and looking through the liquid medium beheld the kitchen
illuminated with a golden glory which also enveloped tabitha and
gilded her silver hair and converted her mean garments into robes of
queenly splendor it reminded him of his golden dream

mr peter remarked tabitha must the wine be drunk before the
money is found

the money is found exclaimed peter with a sort of fierceness
the chest is within my reach i will not sleep till i have turned
this key in the rusty lock but first of all let us drink

there being no corkscrew in the house he smote the neck of the bottle
with old peter goldthwaite's rusty key and decapitated the sealed
cork at a single blow he then filled two little china teacups which
tabitha had brought from the cupboard so clear and brilliant was this
aged wine that it shone within the cups and rendered the sprig of
scarlet flowers at the bottom of each more distinctly visible than
when there had been no wine there its rich and delicate perfume
wasted itself round the kitchen

drink tabitha cried peter blessings on the honest old fellow who
set aside this good liquor for you and me and here's to peter
goldthwaite's memory

and good cause have we to remember him quoth tabitha as she drank

how many years and through what changes of fortune and various
calamity had that bottle hoarded up its effervescent joy to be
quaffed at last by two such boon-companions a portion of the
happiness of a former age had been kept for them and was now set free
in a crowd of rejoicing visions to sport amid the storm and desolation
of the present time until they have finished the bottle we must turn
our eyes elsewhere

it so chanced that on this stormy night mr john brown found himself
ill at ease in his wire-cushioned arm-chair by the glowing grate of
anthracite which heated his handsome parlor he was naturally a good
sort of a man and kind and pitiful whenever the misfortunes of others
happened to reach his heart through the padded vest of his own
prosperity this evening he had thought much about his old partner
peter goldthwaite his strange vagaries and continual ill-luck the
poverty of his dwelling at mr brown's last visit and peter's crazed
and haggard aspect when he had talked with him at the window

poor fellow thought mr john brown poor crack-brained peter
goldthwaite for old acquaintance sake i ought to have taken care
that he was comfortable this rough winter these feelings grew so
powerful that in spite of the inclement weather he resolved to visit
peter goldthwaite immediately

the strength of the impulse was really singular every shriek of the
blast seemed a summons or would have seemed so had mr brown been
accustomed to hear the echoes of his own fancy in the wind much
amazed at such active benevolence he huddled himself in his cloak
muffled his throat and ears in comforters and handkerchiefs and thus
fortified bade defiance to the tempest but the powers of the air had
rather the best of the battle mr brown was just weathering the
corner by peter goldthwaite's house when the hurricane caught him off
his feet tossed him face downward into a snow-bank and proceeded to
bury his protuberant part beneath fresh drifts there seemed little
hope of his reappearance earlier than the next thaw at the same
moment his hat was snatched away and whirled aloft into some
far-distant region whence no tidings have as yet returned

nevertheless mr brown contrived to burrow a passage through the
snow-drift and with his bare head bent against the storm floundered
onward to peter's door there was such a creaking and groaning and
rattling and such an ominous shaking throughout the crazy edifice
that the loudest rap would have been inaudible to those within he
therefore entered without ceremony and groped his way to the kitchen
his intrusion even there was unnoticed peter and tabitha stood with
their backs to the door stooping over a large chest which apparently
they had just dragged from a cavity or concealed closet on the left
side of the chimney by the lamp in the old woman's hand mr brown saw
that the chest was barred and clamped with iron strengthened with
iron plates and studded with iron nails so as to be a fit receptacle
in which the wealth of one century might be hoarded up for the wants
of another

peter goldthwaite was inserting a key into the lock

oh tabitha cried he with tremulous rapture how shall i endure
the effulgence the gold the bright bright gold methinks i can
remember my last glance at it just as the iron-plated lid fell down
and ever since being seventy years it has been blazing in secret and
gathering its splendor against this glorious moment it will flash
upon us like the noonday sun

then shade your eyes mr peter said tabitha with somewhat less
patience than usual but for mercy's sake do turn the key

and with a strong effort of both hands peter did force the rusty key
through the intricacies of the rusty lock mr brown in the mean
time had drawn near and thrust his eager visage between those of the
other two at the instant that peter threw up the lid no sudden blaze
illuminated the kitchen

what's here exclaimed tabitha adjusting her spectacles and holding
the lamp over the open chest old peter goldthwaite's hoard of old
rags

pretty much so tabby said mr brown lifting a handful of the
treasure

oh what a ghost of dead and buried wealth had peter goldthwaite raised
to scare himself out of his scanty wits withal here was the semblance
of an incalculable sum enough to purchase the whole town and build
every street anew but which vast as it was no sane man would have
given a solid sixpence for what then in sober earnest were the
delusive treasures of the chest why here were old provincial bills
of credit and treasury notes and bills of land-banks and all other
bubbles of the sort from the first issue above a century and a half
ago down nearly to the revolution bills of a thousand pounds were
intermixed with parchment pennies and worth no more than they

and this then is old peter goldthwaite's treasure said john
brown your namesake peter was something like yourself and when
the provincial currency had depreciated fifty or seventy-five per
cent he bought it up in expectation of a rise i have heard my
grandfather say that old peter gave his father a mortgage of this very
house and land to raise cash for his silly project but the currency
kept sinking till nobody would take it as a gift and there was old
peter goldthwaite like peter the second with thousands in his
strong-box and hardly a coat to his back he went mad upon the
strength of it but never mind peter it is just the sort of capital
for building castles in the air

the house will be down about our ears cried tabitha as the wind
shook it with increasing violence

let it fall said peter folding his arms as he seated himself upon
the chest

no no my old friend peter said john brown i have house-room for
you and tabby and a safe vault for the chest of treasure to-morrow
we will try to come to an agreement about the sale of this old house
real estate is well up and i could afford you a pretty handsome
price

and i observed peter goldthwaite with reviving spirits have a
plan for laying out the cash to great advantage

why as to that muttered john brown to himself we must apply to
the next court for a guardian to take care of the solid cash and if
peter insists upon speculating he may do it to his heart's content
with old peter goldthwaite's treasure




chippings with a chisel


passing a summer several years since at edgartown on the island of
martha's vineyard i became acquainted with a certain carver of
tombstones who had travelled and voyaged thither from the interior of
massachusetts in search of professional employment the speculation
had turned out so successful that my friend expected to transmute
slate and marble into silver and gold to the amount of at least a
thousand dollars during the few months of his sojourn at nantucket and
the vineyard the secluded life and the simple and primitive spirit
which still characterizes the inhabitants of those islands especially
of martha's vineyard insure their dead friends a longer and dearer
remembrance than the daily novelty and revolving bustle of the world
can elsewhere afford to beings of the past yet while every family is
anxious to erect a memorial to its departed members the untainted
breath of ocean bestows such health and length of days upon the people
of the isles as would cause a melancholy dearth of business to a
resident artist in that line his own monument recording his decease
by starvation would probably be an early specimen of his skill
gravestones therefore have generally been an article of imported
merchandise

in my walks through the burial-ground of edgartown where the dead
have lain so long that the soil once enriched by their decay has
returned to its original barrenness in that ancient burial-ground i
noticed much variety of monumental sculpture the elder stones dated
a century back or more have borders elaborately carved with flowers
and are adorned with a multiplicity of death's-heads crossbones
scythes hour-glasses and other lugubrious emblems of mortality with
here and there a winged cherub to direct the mourner's spirit upward
these productions of gothic taste must have been quite beyond the
colonial skill of the day and were probably carved in london and
brought across the ocean to commemorate the defunct worthies of this
lonely isle the more recent monuments are mere slabs of slate in the
ordinary style without any superfluous flourishes to set off the bald
inscriptions but others and those far the most impressive both to my
taste and feelings were roughly hewn from the gray rocks of the
island evidently by the unskilled hands of surviving friends and
relatives on some there were merely the initials of a name some were
inscribed with misspelt prose or rhyme in deep letters which the moss
and wintry rain of many years had not been able to obliterate these
these were graves where loved ones slept it is an old theme of
satire the falsehood and vanity of monumental eulogies but when
affection and sorrow grave the letters with their own painful labor
then we may be sure that they copy from the record on their hearts

my acquaintance the sculptor he may share that title with greenough
since the dauber of signs is a painter as well as raphael had found a
ready market for all his blank slabs of marble and full occupation in
lettering and ornamenting them he was an elderly man a descendant of
the old puritan family of wigglesworth with a certain simplicity and
singleness both of heart and mind which methinks is more rarely
found among us yankees than in any other community of people in spite
of his gray head and wrinkled brow he was quite like a child in all
matters save what had some reference to his own business he seemed
unless my fancy misled me to view mankind in no other relation than
as people in want of tombstones and his literary attainments
evidently comprehended very little either of prose of poetry which had
not at one time or other been inscribed on slate or marble his sole
task and office among the immortal pilgrims of the tomb the duty for
which providence had sent the old man into the world as it were with
a chisel in his hand was to label the dead bodies lest their names
should be forgotten at the resurrection yet he had not failed within
a narrow scope to gather a few sprigs of earthly and more than
earthly wisdom the harvest of many a grave and lugubrious as his
calling might appear he was as cheerful an old soul as health and
integrity and lack of care could make him and used to set to work
upon one sorrowful inscription or another with that sort of spirit
which impels a man to sing at his labor on the whole i found mr
wigglesworth an entertaining and often instructive if not an
interesting character and partly for the charm of his society and
still more because his work has an invariable attraction for man that
is born of woman i was accustomed to spend some hours a day at his
workshop the quaintness of his remarks and their not infrequent
truth a truth condensed and pointed by the limited sphere of his
view gave a raciness to his talk which mere worldliness and general
cultivation would at once have destroyed

sometimes we would discuss the respective merits of the various
qualities of marble numerous slabs of which were resting against the
walls of the shop or sometimes an hour or two would pass quietly
without a word on either side while i watched how neatly his chisel
struck out letter after letter of the names of the nortons the
mayhews the luces the daggets and other immemorial families of the
vineyard often with an artist's pride the good old sculptor would
speak of favorite productions of his skill which were scattered
throughout the village graveyards of new england but my chief and
most instructive amusement was to witness his interviews with his
customers who held interminable consultations about the form and
fashion of the desired monuments the buried excellence to be
commemorated the anguish to be expressed and finally the lowest
price in dollars and cents for which a marble transcript of their
feelings might be obtained really my mind received many fresh ideas
which perhaps may remain in it even longer than mr wigglesworth's
hardest marble will retain the deepest strokes of his chisel

an elderly lady came to bespeak a monument for her first love who had
been killed by a whale in the pacific ocean no less than forty years
before it was singular that so strong an impression of early feeling
should have survived through the changes of her subsequent life in
the course of which she had been a wife and a mother and so far as i
could judge a comfortable and happy woman reflecting within myself
it appeared to me that this lifelong sorrow as in all good faith
she deemed it was one of the most fortunate circumstances of her
history it had given an ideality to her mind it had kept her purer
and less earthy than she would otherwise have been by drawing a
portion of her sympathies apart from earth amid the throng of
enjoyments and the pressure of worldly care and all the warm
materialism of this life she had communed with a vision and had been
the better for such intercourse faithful to the husband of her
maturity and loving him with a far more real affection than she ever
could have felt for this dream of her girlhood there had still been
an imaginative faith to the ocean-buried so that an ordinary
character had thus been elevated and refined her sighs had been the
breath of heaven to her soul the good lady earnestly desired that the
proposed monument should be ornamented with a carved border of marine
plants interwined with twisted sea-shells such as were probably
waving over her lover's skeleton or strewn around it in the far depths
of the pacific but mr wigglesworth's chisel being inadequate to the
task she was forced to content herself with a rose hanging its head
from a broken stem

after her departure i remarked that the symbol was none of the most
apt

and yet said my friend the sculptor embodying in this image the
thoughts that had been passing through my own mind that broken rose
has shed its sweet smell through forty years of the good woman's
life

it was seldom that i could find such pleasant food for contemplation
as in the above instance none of the applicants i think affected me
more disagreeably than an old man who came with his fourth wife
hanging on his arm to bespeak gravestones for the three former
occupants of his marriage-bed i watched with some anxiety to see
whether his remembrance of either were more affectionate than of the
other two but could discover no symptom of the kind the three
monuments were all to be of the same material and form and each
decorated in bas-relief with two weeping willows one of these
sympathetic trees bending over its fellow which was to be broken in
the midst and rest upon a sepulchral urn this indeed was mr
wigglesworth's standing emblem of conjugal bereavement i shuddered at
the gray polygamist who had so utterly lost the holy sense of
individuality in wedlock that methought he was fain to reckon upon his
fingers how many women who had once slept by his side were now
sleeping in their graves there was even if i wrong him it is no
great matter a glance sidelong at his living spouse as if he were
inclined to drive a thriftier bargain by bespeaking four gravestones
in a lot

i was better pleased with a rough old whaling-captain who gave
directions for a broad marble slab divided into two compartments one
of which was to contain an epitaph on his deceased wife and the other
to be left vacant till death should engrave his own name there as is
frequently the case among the whalers of martha's vineyard so much of
this storm-beaten widower's life had been tossed away on distant seas
that out of twenty years of matrimony he had spent scarce three and
those at scattered intervals beneath his own roof thus the wife of
his youth though she died in his and her declining age retained the
bridal dewdrops fresh around her memory

my observations gave me the idea and mr wigglesworth confirmed it
that husbands were more faithful in setting up memorials to their dead
wives than widows to their dead husbands i was not ill-natured enough
to fancy that women less than men feel so sure of their own constancy
as to be willing to give a pledge of it in marble it is more probably
the fact that while men are able to reflect upon their lost
companions as remembrances apart from themselves women on the other
hand are conscious that a portion of their being has gone with the
departed whithersoever he has gone soul clings to soul the living
dust has a sympathy with the dust of the grave and by the very
strength of that sympathy the wife of the dead shrinks the more
sensitively from reminding the world of its existence the link is
already strong enough it needs no visible symbol and though a
shadow walks ever by her side and the touch of a chill hand is on her
bosom yet life and perchance its natural yearnings may still be
warm within her and inspire her with new hopes of happiness then
would she mark out the grave the scent of which would be perceptible
on the pillow of the second bridal no but rather level its green
mound with the surrounding earth as if when she dug up again her
buried heart the spot had ceased to be a grave

yet in spite of these sentimentalities i was prodigiously amused by
an incident of which i had not the good-fortune to be a witness but
which mr wigglesworth related with considerable humor a gentlewoman
of the town receiving news of her husband's loss at sea had bespoken
a handsome slab of marble and came daily to watch the progress of my
friend's chisel one afternoon when the good lady and the sculptor
were in the very midst of the epitaph which the departed spirit might
have been greatly comforted to read who should walk into the workshop
but the deceased himself in substance as well as spirit he had been
picked up at sea and stood in no present need of tombstone or
epitaph

and how inquired i did his wife bear the shock of joyful
surprise

why said the old man deepening the grin of a death's-head on which
his chisel was just then employed i really felt for the poor woman
it was one of my best pieces of marble and to be thrown away on a
living man

a comely woman with a pretty rosebud of a daughter came to select a
gravestone for a twin-daughter who had died a month before i was
impressed with the different nature of their feelings for the dead
the mother was calm and woefully resigned fully conscious of her
loss as of a treasure which she had not always possessed and
therefore had been aware that it might be taken from her but the
daughter evidently had no real knowledge of what death's doings were
her thoughts knew but not her heart it seemed to me that by the
print and pressure which the dead sister had left upon the survivor's
spirit her feelings were almost the same as if she still stood side by
side and arm in arm with the departed looking at the slabs of marble
and once or twice she glanced around with a sunny smile which as its
sister-smile had faded for ever soon grew confusedly overshadowed
perchance her consciousness was truer than her reflection perchance
her dead sister was a closer companion than in life

the mother and daughter talked a long while with mr wigglesworth
about a suitable epitaph and finally chose an ordinary verse of
ill-matched rhymes which had already been inscribed upon innumerable
tombstones but when we ridicule the triteness of monumental verses
we forget that sorrow reads far deeper in them than we can and finds
a profound and individual purport in what seems so vague and
inexpressive unless interpreted by her she makes the epitaph anew
though the selfsame words may have served for a thousand graves

and yet said i afterward to mr wigglesworth they might have made
a better choice than this while you were discussing the subject i was
struck by at least a dozen simple and natural expressions from the
lips of both mother and daughter one of these would have formed an
inscription equally original and appropriate

no no replied the sculptor shaking his head there is a good
deal of comfort to be gathered from these little old scraps of poetry
and so i always recommend them in preference to any new-fangled ones
and somehow they seem to stretch to suit a great grief and shrink to
fit a small one

it was not seldom that ludicrous images were excited by what took
place between mr wigglesworth and his customers a shrewd gentlewoman
who kept a tavern in the town was anxious to obtain two or three
gravestones for the deceased members of her family and to pay for
these solemn commodities by taking the sculptor to board hereupon a
fantasy arose in my mind of good mr wigglesworth sitting down to
dinner at a broad flat tombstone carving one of his own plump little
marble cherubs gnawing a pair of crossbones and drinking out of a
hollow death's-head or perhaps a lachrymatory vase or sepulchral urn
while his hostess's dead children waited on him at the ghastly
banquet on communicating this nonsensical picture to the old man he
laughed heartily and pronounced my humor to be of the right sort

i have lived at such a table all my days said he and eaten no
small quantity of slate and marble

hard fare rejoined i smiling but you seemed to have found it
excellent of digestion too

a man of fifty or thereabouts with a harsh unpleasant countenance
ordered a stone for the grave of his bitter enemy with whom he had
waged warfare half a lifetime to their mutual misery and ruin the
secret of this phenomenon was that hatred had become the sustenance
and enjoyment of the poor wretch's soul it had supplied the place of
all kindly affections it had been really a bond of sympathy between
himself and the man who shared the passion and when its object died
the unappeasable foe was the only mourner for the dead he expressed a
purpose of being buried side by side with his enemy

i doubt whether their dust will mingle remarked the old sculptor to
me for often there was an earthliness in his conceptions

oh yes replied i who had mused long upon the incident and when
they rise again these bitter foes may find themselves dear friends
methinks what they mistook for hatred was but love under a mask

a gentleman of antiquarian propensities provided a memorial for an
indian of chabbiquidick one of the few of untainted blood remaining
in that region and said to be a hereditary chieftain descended from
the sachem who welcomed governor mayhew to the vineyard mr
wiggles-worth exerted his best skill to carve a broken bow and
scattered sheaf of arrows in memory of the hunters and warriors whose
race was ended here but he likewise sculptured a cherub to denote
that the poor indian had shared the christian's hope of immortality

why observed i taking a perverse view of the winged boy and the
bow and arrows it looks more like cupid's tomb than an indian
chief's

you talk nonsense said the sculptor with the offended pride of
art he then added with his usual good-nature how can cupid die when
there are such pretty maidens in the vineyard

very true answered i and for the rest of the day i thought of
other matters than tombstones

at our next meeting i found him chiselling an open book upon a marble
headstone and concluded that it was meant to express the erudition of
some black-letter clergyman of the cotton mather school it turned
out however to be emblematical of the scriptural knowledge of an old
woman who had never read anything but her bible and the monument was
a tribute to her piety and good works from the orthodox church of
which she had been a member in strange contrast with this christian
woman's memorial was that of an infidel whose gravestone by his own
direction bore an avowal of his belief that the spirit within him
would be extinguished like a flame and that the nothingness whence he
sprang would receive him again

mr wigglesworth consulted me as to the propriety of enabling a dead
man's dust to utter this dreadful creed

if i thought said he that a single mortal would read the
inscription without a shudder my chisel should never cut a letter of
it but when the grave speaks such falsehoods the soul of man will
know the truth by its own horror

so it will said i struck by the idea the poor infidel may strive
to preach blasphemies from his grave but it will be only another
method of impressing the soul with a consciousness of immortality

there was an old man by the name of norton noted throughout the
island for his great wealth which he had accumulated by the exercise
of strong and shrewd faculties combined with a most penurious
disposition this wretched miser conscious that he had not a friend
to be mindful of him in his grave had himself taken the needful
precautions for posthumous remembrance by bespeaking an immense slab
of white marble with a long epitaph in raised letters the whole to be
as magnificent as mr wigglesworth's skill could make it there was
something very characteristic in this contrivance to have his money's
worth even from his own tombstone which indeed afforded him more
enjoyment in the few months that he lived thereafter than it probably
will in a whole century now that it is laid over his bones

this incident reminds me of a young girl a pale slender feeble
creature most unlike the other rosy and healthful damsels of the
vineyard amid whose brightness she was fading away day after day did
the poor maiden come to the sculptor's shop and pass from one piece of
marble to another till at last she pencilled her name upon a slender
slab which i think was of a more spotless white than all the rest i
saw her no more but soon afterward found mr wigglesworth cutting her
virgin-name into the stone which she had chosen

she is dead poor girl said he interrupting the tune which he was
whistling and she chose a good piece of stuff for her headstone
now which of these slabs would you like best to see your own name
upon

why to tell you the truth my good mr wigglesworth replied i
after a moment's pause for the abruptness of the question had
somewhat startled me to be quite sincere with you i care little or
nothing about a stone for my own grave and am somewhat inclined to
scepticism as to the propriety of erecting monuments at all over the
dust that once was human the weight of these heavy marbles though
unfelt by the dead corpse or the enfranchised soul presses drearily
upon the spirit of the survivor and causes him to connect the idea of
death with the dungeon-like imprisonment of the tomb instead of with
the freedom of the skies every gravestone that you ever made is the
visible symbol of a mistaken system our thoughts should soar upward
with the butterfly not linger with the exuvi√¶ that confined him in
truth and reason neither those whom we call the living and still
less the departed have anything to do with the grave

i never heard anything so heathenish said mr wigglesworth
perplexed and displeased at sentiments which controverted all his
notions and feelings and implied the utter waste and worse of his
whole life's labor would you forget your dead friends the moment
they are under the sod

they are not under the sod i rejoined then why should i mark the
spot where there is no treasure hidden forget them no but to
remember them aright i would forget what they have cast off and to
gain the truer conception of death i would forget the grave

but still the good old sculptor murmured and stumbled as it were
over the gravestones amid which he had walked through life whether he
were right or wrong i had grown the wiser from our companionship and
from my observations of nature and character as displayed by those who
came with their old griefs or their new ones to get them recorded
upon his slabs of marble and yet with my gain of wisdom i had
likewise gained perplexity for there was a strange doubt in my mind
whether the dark shadowing of this life the sorrows and regrets have
not as much real comfort in them leaving religious influences out of
the question as what we term life's joys




the shaker bridal


one day in the sick-chamber of father ephraim who had been forty
years the presiding elder over the shaker settlement at goshen there
was an assemblage of several of the chief men of the sect individuals
had come from the rich establishment at lebanon from canterbury
harvard and alfred and from all the other localities where this
strange people have fertilized the rugged hills of new england by
their systematic industry an elder was likewise there who had made a
pilgrimage of a thousand miles from a village of the faithful in
kentucky to visit his spiritual kindred the children of the sainted
mother ann he had partaken of the homely abundance of their tables
had quaffed the far-famed shaker cider and had joined in the sacred
dance every step of which is believed to alienate the enthusiast from
earth and bear him onward to heavenly purity and bliss his brethren
of the north had now courteously invited him to be present on an
occasion when the concurrence of every eminent member of their
community was peculiarly desirable

the venerable father ephraim sat in his easy-chair not only
hoary-headed and infirm with age but worn down by a lingering disease
which it was evident would very soon transfer his patriarchal staff to
other hands at his footstool stood a man and woman both clad in the
shaker garb

my brethren said father ephraim to the surrounding elders feebly
exerting himself to utter these few words here are the son and
daughter to whom i would commit the trust of which providence is about
to lighten my weary shoulders read their faces i pray you and say
whether the inward movement of the spirit hath guided my choice
aright

accordingly each elder looked at the two candidates with a most
scrutinizing gaze the man whose name was adam colburn had a face
sunburnt with labor in the fields yet intelligent thoughtful and
traced with cares enough for a whole lifetime though he had barely
reached middle age there was something severe in his aspect and a
rigidity throughout his person characteristics that caused him
generally to be taken for a schoolmaster which vocation in fact he
had formerly exercised for several years the woman martha pierson
was somewhat above thirty thin and pale as a shaker sister almost
invariably is and not entirely free from that corpse-like appearance
which the garb of the sisterhood is so well calculated to impart

this pair are still in the summer of their years observed the elder
from harvard a shrewd old man i would like better to see the
hoar-frost of autumn on their heads methinks also they will be
exposed to peculiar temptations on account of the carnal desires which
have heretofore subsisted between them

nay brother said the elder from canterbury the hoar-frost and
the black frost hath done its work on brother adam and sister martha
even as we sometimes discern its traces in our cornfields while they
are yet green and why should we question the wisdom of our venerable
father's purpose although this pair in their early youth have loved
one another as the world's people love are there not many brethren
and sisters among us who have lived long together in wedlock yet
adopting our faith find their hearts purified from all but spiritual
affection

whether or no the early loves of adam and martha had rendered it
inexpedient that they should now preside together over a shaker
village it was certainly most singular that such should be the final
result of many warm and tender hopes children of neighboring
families their affection was older even than their school-days it
seemed an innate principle interfused among all their sentiments and
feelings and not so much a distinct remembrance as connected with
their whole volume of remembrances but just as they reached a proper
age for their union misfortunes had fallen heavily on both and made it
necessary that they should resort to personal labor for a bare
subsistence even under these circumstances martha pierson would
probably have consented to unite her fate with adam colburn's and
secure of the bliss of mutual love would patiently have awaited the
less important gifts of fortune but adam being of a calm and
cautious character was loth to relinquish the advantages which a
single man possesses for raising himself in the world year after
year therefore their marriage had been deferred

adam colburn had followed many vocations had travelled far and seen
much of the world and of life martha had earned her bread sometimes
as a sempstress sometimes as help to a farmer's wife sometimes as
schoolmistress of the village children sometimes as a nurse or
watcher of the sick thus acquiring a varied experience the ultimate
use of which she little anticipated but nothing had gone prosperously
with either of the lovers at no subsequent moment would matrimony
have been so prudent a measure as when they had first parted in the
opening bloom of life to seek a better fortune still they had held
fast their mutual faith martha might have been the wife of a man who
sat among the senators of his native state and adam could have won
the hand as he had unintentionally won the heart of a rich and
comely widow but neither of them desired good-fortune save to share
it with the other

at length that calm despair which occurs only in a strong and somewhat
stubborn character and yields to no second spring of hope settled down
on the spirit of adam colburn he sought an interview with martha and
proposed that they should join the society of shakers the converts of
this sect are oftener driven within its hospitable gates by worldly
misfortune than drawn thither by fanaticism and are received without
inquisition as to their motives martha faithful still had placed
her hand in that of her lover and accompanied him to the shaker
village here the natural capacity of each cultivated and
strengthened by the difficulties of their previous lives had soon
gained them an important rank in the society whose members are
generally below the ordinary standard of intelligence their faith and
feelings had in some degree become assimilated to those of their
fellow-worshippers adam colburn gradually acquired reputation not
only in the management of the temporal affairs of the society but as
a clear and efficient preacher of their doctrines martha was not less
distinguished in the duties proper to her sex finally when the
infirmities of father ephraim had admonished him to seek a successor
in his patriarchal office he thought of adam and martha and proposed
to renew in their persons the primitive form of shaker government as
established by mother ann they were to be the father and mother of
the village the simple ceremony which would constitute them such was
now to be performed

son adam and daughter martha said the venerable father ephraim
fixing his aged eyes piercingly upon them if ye can conscientiously
undertake this charge speak that the brethren may not doubt of your
fitness

father replied adam speaking with the calmness of his character
i came to your village a disappointed man weary of the world worn
out with continual trouble seeking only a security against evil
fortune as i had no hope of good even my wishes of worldly success
were almost dead within me i came hither as a man might come to a
tomb willing to lie down in its gloom and coldness for the sake of its
peace and quiet there was but one earthly affection in my breast and
it had grown calmer since my youth so that i was satisfied to bring
martha to be my sister in our new abode we are brother and sister
nor would i have it otherwise and in this peaceful village i have
found all that i hope for all that i desire i will strive with my
best strength for the spiritual and temporal good of our community my
conscience is not doubtful in this matter i am ready to receive the
trust

thou hast spoken well son adam said the father god will bless
thee in the office which i am about to resign

but our sister observed the elder from harvard hath she not
likewise a gift to declare her sentiments

martha started and moved her lips as if she would have made a formal
reply to this appeal but had she attempted it perhaps the old
recollections the long-repressed feelings of childhood youth and
womanhood might have gushed from her heart in words that it would
have been profanation to utter there

adam has spoken said she hurriedly his sentiments are likewise
mine

but while speaking these few words martha grew so pale that she looked
fitter to be laid in her coffin than to stand in the presence of
father ephraim and the elders she shuddered also as if there were
something awful or horrible in her situation and destiny it required
indeed a more than feminine strength of nerve to sustain the fixed
observance of men so exalted and famous throughout the beet as these
were they had overcome their natural sympathy with human frailties
and affections one when he joined the society had brought with him
his wife and children but never from that hour had spoken a fond word
to the former or taken his best-loved child upon his knee another
whose family refused to follow him had been enabled such was his
gift of holy fortitude to leave them to the mercy of the world the
youngest of the elders a man of about fifty had been bred from
infancy in a shaker village and was said never to have clasped a
woman's hand in his own and to have no conception of a closer tie
than the cold fraternal one of the sect old father ephraim was the
most awful character of all in his youth he had been a dissolute
libertine but was converted by mother ann herself and had partaken
of the wild fanaticism of the early shakers tradition whispered at
the firesides of the village that mother ann had been compelled to
sear his heart of flesh with a red-hot iron before it could be
purified from earthly passions

however that might be poor martha had a woman's heart and a tender
one and it quailed within her as she looked round at those strange
old men and from them to the calm features of adam colburn but
perceiving that the elders eyed her doubtfully she gasped for breath
and again spoke

with what strength is left me by my many troubles said she i am
ready to undertake this charge and to do my best in it

my children join your hands said father ephraim

they did so the elders stood up around and the father feebly raised
himself to a more erect position but continued sitting in his great
chair

i have bidden you to join your hands said he not in earthly
affection for ye have cast off its chains for ever but as brother
and sister in spiritual love and helpers of one another in your
allotted task teach unto others the faith which ye have received
open wide your gates i deliver you the keys thereof open them wide
to all who will give up the iniquities of the world and come hither to
lead lives of purity and peace receive the weary ones who have known
the vanity of earth receive the little children that they may never
learn that miserable lesson and a blessing be upon your labors so
that the time may hasten on when the mission of mother ann shall have
wrought its full effect when children shall no more be born and die
and the last survivor of mortal race some old and weary man like
me shall see the sun go down nevermore to rise on a world of sin and
sorrow

the aged father sank back exhausted and the surrounding elders
deemed with good reason that the hour was come when the new heads of
the village must enter on their patriarchal duties in their attention
to father ephraim their eyes were turned from martha pierson who grew
paler and paler unnoticed even by adam colburn he indeed had
withdrawn his hand from hers and folded his arms with a sense of
satisfied ambition but paler and paler grew martha by his side till
like a corpse in its burial-clothes she sank down at the feet of her
early lover for after many trials firmly borne her heart could
endure the weight of its desolate agony no longer




night-sketches

beneath an umbrella


pleasant is a rainy winter's day within-doors the best study for such
a day or the best amusement call it what you will is a book of
travels describing scenes the most unlike that sombre one which is
mistily presented through the windows i have experienced that fancy
is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and vivid colors
to the objects which the author has spread upon his page and that his
words become magic spells to summon up a thousand varied pictures
strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar walls of the room and
outlandish figures thrust themselves almost within the sacred
precincts of the hearth small as my chamber is it has space enough
to contain the ocean-like circumference of an arabian desert its
parched sands tracked by the long line of a caravan with the camels
patiently journeying through the heavy sunshine though my ceiling be
not lofty yet i can pile up the mountains of central asia beneath it
till their summits shine far above the clouds of the middle
atmosphere and with my humble means a wealth that is not taxable i
can transport hither the magnificent merchandise of an oriental
bazaar and call a crowd of purchasers from distant countries to pay a
fair profit for the precious articles which are displayed on all
sides true it is however that amid the bustle of traffic or
whatever else may seem to be going on around me the raindrops will
occasionally be heard to patter against my window-panes which look
forth upon one of the quietest streets in a new england town after a
time too the visions vanish and will not appear again at my
bidding then it being nightfall a gloomy sense of unreality
depresses my spirits and impels me to venture out before the clock
shall strike bedtime to satisfy myself that the world is not entirely
made up of such shadowy materials as have busied me throughout the
day a dreamer may dwell so long among fantasies that the things
without him will seem as unreal as those within

when eve has fairly set in therefore i sally forth tightly
buttoning my shaggy overcoat and hoisting my umbrella the silken dome
of which immediately resounds with the heavy drumming of the invisible
raindrops pausing on the lowest doorstep i contrast the warmth and
cheerfulness of my deserted fireside with the drear obscurity and
chill discomfort into which i am about to plunge now come fearful
auguries innumerable as the drops of rain did not my manhood cry
shame upon me i should turn back within-doors resume my elbow-chair
my slippers and my book pass such an evening of sluggish enjoyment as
the day has been and go to bed inglorious the same shivering
reluctance no doubt has quelled for a moment the adventurous spirit
of many a traveller when his feet which were destined to measure the
earth around were leaving their last tracks in the home-paths

in my own case poor human nature may be allowed a few misgivings i
look upward and discern no sky not even an unfathomable void but
only a black impenetrable nothingness as though heaven and all its
lights were blotted from the system of the universe it is as if
nature were dead and the world had put on black and the clouds were
weeping for her with their tears upon my cheek i turn my eyes
earthward but find little consolation here below a lamp is burning
dimly at the distant corner and throws just enough of light along the
street to show and exaggerate by so faintly showing the perils and
difficulties which beset my path yonder dingily-white remnant of a
huge snowbank which will yet cumber the sidewalk till the latter days
of march over or through that wintry waste must i stride onward
beyond lies a certain slough of despond a concoction of mud and
liquid filth ankle-deep leg-deep neck-deep in a word of unknown
bottom on which the lamplight does not even glimmer but which i have
occasionally watched in the gradual growth of its horrors from morn
till nightfall should i flounder into its depths farewell to upper
earth and hark how roughly resounds the roaring of a stream the
turbulent career of which is partially reddened by the gleam of the
lamp but elsewhere brawls noisily through the densest gloom oh
should i be swept away in fording that impetuous and unclean torrent
the coroner will have a job with an unfortunate gentleman who would
fain end his troubles anywhere but in a mud-puddle

pshaw i will linger not another instant at arm's-length from these
dim terrors which grow more obscurely formidable the longer i delay
to grapple with them now for the onset and lo with little damage
save a dash of rain in the face and breast a splash of mud high up
the pantaloons and the left boot full of ice-cold water behold me at
the corner of the street the lamp throws down a circle of red light
around me and twinkling onward from corner to corner i discern other
beacons marshalling my way to a brighter scene but this is a
lonesome and dreary spot the tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the
storm with their blinds all closed even as a man winks when he faces
a spattering gust how loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin
spouts the puffs of wind are boisterous and seem to assail me from
various quarters at once i have often observed that this corner is a
haunt and loitering-place for those winds which have no work to do
upon the deep dashing ships against our iron-bound shores nor in the
forest tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their
vast roots here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief
see at this moment how they assail yonder poor woman who is passing
just within the verge of the lamplight one blast struggles for her
umbrella and turns it wrong side outward another whisks the cape of
her cloak across her eyes while a third takes most unwarrantable
liberties with the lower part of her attire happily the good dame is
no gossamer but a figure of rotundity and fleshly substance else
would these aerial tormentors whirl her aloft like a witch upon a
broomstick and set her down doubtless in the filthiest kennel
hereabout

from hence i tread upon firm pavements into the centre of the town
here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great
victory has been won either on the battlefield or at the polls two
rows of shops with windows down nearly to the ground cast a glow from
side to side while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy and
thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away the wet sidewalks
gleam with a broad sheet of red light the raindrops glitter as if the
sky were pouring down rubies the spouts gush with fire methinks the
scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare which mortals throw around
their footsteps in the moral world thus bedazzling themselves till
they forget the impenetrable obscurity that hems them in and that can
be dispelled only by radiance from above

and after all it is a cheerless scene and cheerless are the
wanderers in it here comes one who has so long been familiar with
tempestuous weather that he takes the bluster of the storm for a
friendly greeting as if it should say how fare ye brother he is
a retired sea-captain wrapped in some nameless garment of the
pea-jacket order and is now laying his course toward the
marine-insurance office there to spin yarns of gale and shipwreck
with a crew of old seadogs like himself the blast will put in its
word among their hoarse voices and be understood by all of them next
i meet an unhappy slipshod gentleman with a cloak flung hastily over
his shoulders running a race with boisterous winds and striving to
glide between the drops of rain some domestic emergency or other has
blown this miserable man from his warm fireside in quest of a doctor
see that little vagabond how carelessly he has taken his stand right
underneath a spout while staring at some object of curiosity in a
shop-window surely the rain is his native element he must have
fallen with it from the clouds as frogs are supposed to do

here is a picture and a pretty one a young man and a girl both
enveloped in cloaks and huddled beneath the scanty protection of a
cotton umbrella she wears rubber overshoes but he is in his
dancing-pumps and they are on their way no doubt to some
cotillon-party or subscription-ball at a dollar a head refreshments
included thus they struggle against the gloomy tempest lured onward
by a vision of festal splendor but ah a most lamentable disaster
bewildered by the red blue and yellow meteors in an apothecary's
window they have stepped upon a slippery remnant of ice and are
precipitated into a confluence of swollen floods at the corner of two
streets luckless lovers were it my nature to be other than a
looker-on in life i would attempt your rescue since that may not be
i vow should you be drowned to weave such a pathetic story of your
fate as shall call forth tears enough to drown you both anew do ye
touch bottom my young friends yes they emerge like a water-nymph
and a river-deity and paddle hand in hand out of the depths of the
dark pool they hurry homeward dripping disconsolate abashed but
with love too warm to be chilled by the cold water they have stood a
test which proves too strong for many faithful though over head and
ears in trouble

onward i go deriving a sympathetic joy or sorrow from the varied
aspect of mortal affairs even as my figure catches a gleam from the
lighted windows or is blackened by an interval of darkness not that
mine is altogether a chameleon spirit with no hue of its own now i
pass into a more retired street where the dwellings of wealth and
poverty are intermingled presenting a range of strongly-contrasted
pictures here too may be found the golden mean through yonder
casement i discern a family circle the grandmother the parents and
the children all flickering shadow-like in the glow of a
wood-fire bluster fierce blast and beat thou wintry rain against
the window-panes ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside surely
my fate is hard that i should be wandering homeless here taking to my
bosom night and storm and solitude instead of wife and children
peace murmurer doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the
hearth though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images

well here is still a brighter scene a stately mansion illuminated
for a ball with cut-glass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every
room and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls see a coach has
stopped whence emerges a slender beauty who canopied by two
umbrellas glides within the portal and vanishes amid lightsome
thrills of music will she ever feel the night-wind and the rain
perhaps perhaps and will death and sorrow ever enter that proud
mansion as surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls
to-night such thoughts sadden yet satisfy my heart for they teach me
that the poor man in this mean weatherbeaten hovel without a fire to
cheer him may call the rich his brother brethren by sorrow who must
be an inmate of both their households brethren by death who will
lead them both to other homes

onward still onward i plunge into the night now have i reached the
utmost limits of the town where the last lamp struggles feebly with
the darkness like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the
borders of uncreated space it is strange what sensations of sublimity
may spring from a very humble source such are suggested by this
hollow roar of a subterranean cataract where the mighty stream of a
kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate and is seen no more
on earth listen a while to its voice of mystery and fancy will
magnify it till you start and smile at the illusion and now another
sound the rumbling of wheels as the mail-coach outward bound rolls
heavily off the pavements and splashes through the mud and water of
the road all night long the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro
between drowsy watch and troubled sleep and will dream of their own
quiet beds and awake to find themselves still jolting onward happier
my lot who will straightway hie me to my familiar room and toast
myself comfortably before the fire musing and fitfully dozing and
fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see but first let me
gaze at this solitary figure who comes hitherward with a tin lantern
which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground
about him he passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom whither i will
not follow him

this figure shall supply me with a moral wherewith for lack of a more
appropriate one i may wind up my sketch he fears not to tread the
dreary path before him because his lantern which was kindled at the
fireside of his home will light him back to that same fireside again
and thus we night-wanderers through a stormy and dismal world if we
bear the lamp of faith enkindled at a celestial fire it will surely
lead us home to that heaven whence its radiance was borrowed




endicott and the red cross


at noon of an autumnal day more than two centuries ago the english
colors were displayed by the standard bearer of the salem train-band
which had mustered for martial exercise under the orders of john
endicott it was a period when the religious exiles were accustomed
often to buckle on their armor and practise the handling of their
weapons of war since the first settlement of new england its
prospects had never been so dismal the dissensions between charles i
and his subjects were then and for several years afterward confined
to the floor of parliament the measures of the king and ministry were
rendered more tyrannically violent by an opposition which had not yet
acquired sufficient confidence in its own strength to resist royal
injustice with the sword the bigoted and haughty primate laud
archbishop of canterbury controlled the religious affairs of the
realm and was consequently invested with powers which might have
wrought the utter ruin of the two puritan colonies plymouth and
massachusetts there is evidence on record that our forefathers
perceived their danger but were resolved that their infant country
should not fall without a struggle even beneath the giant strength of
the king's right arm

such was the aspect of the times when the folds of the english banner
with the red cross in its field were flung out over a company of
puritans their leader the famous endicott was a man of stern and
resolute countenance the effect of which was heightened by a grizzled
beard that swept the upper portion of his breastplate this piece of
armor was so highly polished that the whole surrounding scene had its
image in the glittering steel the central object in the mirrored
picture was an edifice of humble architecture with neither steeple nor
bell to proclaim it what nevertheless it was the house of prayer
a token of the perils of the wilderness was seen in the grim head of a
wolf which had just been slain within the precincts of the town and
according to the regular mode of claiming the bounty was nailed on
the porch of the meeting-house the blood was still plashing on the
doorstep there happened to be visible at the same noontide hour so
many other characteristics of the times and manners of the puritans
that we must endeavor to represent them in a sketch though far less
vividly than they were reflected in the polished breastplate of john
endicott

in close vicinity to the sacred edifice appeared that important engine
of puritanic authority the whipping-post with the soil around it well
trodden by the feet of evil-doers who had there been disciplined at
one corner of the meeting-house was the pillory and at the other the
stocks and by a singular good fortune for our sketch the head of an
episcopalian and suspected catholic was grotesquely encased in the
former machine while a fellow-criminal who had boisterously quaffed a
health to the king was confined by the legs in the latter side by
side on the meeting-house steps stood a male and a female figure the
man was a tall lean haggard personification of fanaticism bearing
on his breast this label a wanton gospeller which betokened that
he had dared to give interpretations of holy writ unsanctioned by the
infallible judgment of the civil and religious rulers his aspect
showed no lack of zeal to maintain his heterodoxies even at the stake
the woman wore a cleft stick on her tongue in appropriate retribution
for having wagged that unruly member against the elders of the church
and her countenance and gestures gave much cause to apprehend that the
moment the stick should be removed a repetition of the offence would
demand new ingenuity in chastising it

the above-mentioned individuals had been sentenced to undergo their
various modes of ignominy for the space of one hour at noonday but
among the crowd were several whose punishment would be lifelong some
whose ears had been cropped like those of puppy-dogs others whose
cheeks had been branded with the initials of their misdemeanors one
with his nostrils slit and seared and another with a halter about his
neck which he was forbidden ever to take off or to conceal beneath
his garments methinks he must have been grievously tempted to affix
the other end of the rope to some convenient beam or bough there was
likewise a young woman with no mean share of beauty whose doom it was
to wear the letter a on the breast of her gown in the eyes of all the
world and her own children and even her own children knew what that
initial signified sporting with her infamy the lost and desperate
creature had embroidered the fatal token in scarlet cloth with golden
thread and the nicest art of needlework so that the capital a might
have been thought to mean admirable or anything rather than
adulteress

let not the reader argue from any of these evidences of iniquity that
the times of the puritans were more vicious than our own when as we
pass along the very street of this sketch we discern no badge of
infamy on man or woman it was the policy of our ancestors to search
out even the most secret sins and expose them to shame without fear
or favor in the broadest light of the noonday sun were such the
custom now perchance we might find materials for a no less piquant
sketch than the above

except the malefactors whom we have described and the diseased or
infirm persons the whole male population of the town between sixteen
years and sixty were seen in the ranks of the train-band a few
stately savages in all the pomp and dignity of the primeval indian
stood gazing at the spectacle their flint-headed arrows were but
childish weapons compared with the matchlocks of the puritans and
would have rattled harmlessly against the steel caps and hammered iron
breastplates which enclosed each soldier in an individual fortress
the valiant john endicott glanced with an eye of pride at his sturdy
followers and prepared to renew the martial toils of the day

come my stout hearts quoth he drawing his sword let us show
these poor heathen that we can handle our weapons like men of might
well for them if they put us not to prove it in earnest

the iron-breasted company straightened their line and each man drew
the heavy butt of his matchlock close to his left foot thus awaiting
the orders of the captain but as endicott glanced right and left
along the front he discovered a personage at some little distance with
whom it behoved him to hold a parley it was an elderly gentleman
wearing a black cloak and band and a high-crowned hat beneath which
was a velvet skull-cap the whole being the garb of a puritan
minister this reverend person bore a staff which seemed to have been
recently cut in the forest and his shoes were bemired as if he had
been travelling on foot through the swamps of the wilderness his
aspect was perfectly that of a pilgrim heightened also by an
apostolic dignity just as endicott perceived him he laid aside his
staff and stooped to drink at a bubbling fountain which gushed into
the sunshine about a score of yards from the corner of the
meeting-house but ere the good man drank he turned his face
heavenward in thankfulness and then holding back his gray beard with
one hand he scooped up his simple draught in the hollow of the other

what ho good mr williams shouted endicott you are welcome back
again to our town of peace how does our worthy governor winthrop and
what news from boston

the governor hath his health worshipful sir answered roger
williams now resuming his staff and drawing near and for the news
here is a letter which knowing i was to travel hitherward to-day his
excellency committed to my charge belike it contains tidings of much
import for a ship arrived yesterday from england

mr williams the minister of salem and of course known to all the
spectators had now reached the spot where endicott was standing under
the banner of his company and put the governor's epistle into his
hand the broad seal was impressed with winthrop's coat-of-arms
endicott hastily unclosed the letter and began to read while as his
eye passed down the page a wrathful change came over his manly
countenance the blood glowed through it till it seemed to be kindling
with an internal heat nor was it unnatural to suppose that his
breastplate would likewise become red hot with the angry fire of the
bosom which it covered arriving at the conclusion he shook the
letter fiercely in his hand so that it rustled as loud as the flag
above his head

black tidings these mr williams said he blacker never came to
new england doubtless you know their purport

yea truly replied roger williams for the governor consulted
respecting this matter with my brethren in the ministry at boston and
my opinion was likewise asked and his excellency entreats you by me
that the news be not suddenly noised abroad lest the people be
stirred up unto some outbreak and thereby give the king and the
archbishop a handle against us

the governor is a wise man a wise man and a meek and moderate
said endicott setting his teeth grimly nevertheless i must do
according to my own best judgment there is neither man woman nor
child in new england but has a concern as dear as life in these
tidings and if john endicott's voice be loud enough man woman and
child shall hear them soldiers wheel into a hollow square ho
good people here are news for one and all of you

the soldiers closed in around their captain and he and roger williams
stood together under the banner of the red cross while the women and
the aged men pressed forward and the mothers held up their children to
look endicott in the face a few taps of the drum gave signal for
silence and attention

fellow-soldiers fellow-exiles began endicott speaking under
strong excitement yet powerfully restraining it wherefore did ye
leave your native country wherefore i say have we left the green
and fertile fields the cottages or perchance the old gray halls
where we were born and bred the churchyards where our forefathers lie
buried wherefore have we come hither to set up our own tombstones in
a wilderness a howling wilderness it is the wolf and the bear meet
us within halloo of our dwellings the savage lieth in wait for us in
the dismal shadow of the woods the stubborn roots of the trees break
our ploughshares when we would till the earth our children cry for
bread and we must dig in the sands of the seashore to satisfy them
wherefore i say again have we sought this country of a rugged soil
and wintry sky was it not for the enjoyment of our civil rights was
it not for liberty to worship god according to our conscience

call you this liberty of conscience interrupted a voice on the
steps of the meeting-house

it was the wanton gospeller a sad and quiet smile flitted across the
mild visage of roger williams but endicott in the excitement of the
moment shook his sword wrathfully at the culprit an ominous gesture
from a man like him

what hast thou to do with conscience thou knave cried he i said
liberty to worship god not license to profane and ridicule him break
not in upon my speech or i will lay thee neck and heels till this
time to-morrow hearken to me friends nor heed that accursed
rhapsodist as i was saying we have sacrificed all things and have
come to a land whereof the old world hath scarcely heard that we
might make a new world unto ourselves and painfully seek a path from
hence to heaven but what think ye now this son of a scotch
tyrant this grandson of a papistical and adulterous scotch woman
whose death proved that a golden crown doth not always save an
anointed head from the block 

nay brother nay interposed mr williams thy words are not meet
for a secret chamber far less for a public street

hold thy peace roger williams answered endicott imperiously my
spirit is wiser than thine for the business now in hand i tell ye
fellow-exiles that charles of england and laud our bitterest
persecutor arch-priest of canterbury are resolute to pursue us even
hither they are taking counsel saith this letter to send over a
governor-general in whose breast shall be deposited all the law and
equity of the land they are minded also to establish the idolatrous
forms of english episcopacy so that when laud shall kiss the pope's
toe as cardinal of rome he may deliver new england bound hand and
foot into the power of his master

a deep groan from the auditors a sound of wrath as well as fear and
sorrow responded to this intelligence

look ye to it brethren resumed endicott with increasing energy
if this king and this arch-prelate have their will we shall briefly
behold a cross on the spire of this tabernacle which we have builded
and a high altar within its walls with wax tapers burning round it at
noon-day we shall hear the sacring-bell and the voices of the romish
priests saying the mass but think ye christian men that these
abominations may be suffered without a sword drawn without a shot
fired without blood spilt yea on the very stairs of the pulpit no
be ye strong of hand and stout of heart here we stand on our own
soil which we have bought with our goods which we have won with our
swords which we have cleared with our axes which we have tilled with
the sweat of our brows which we have sanctified with our prayers to
the god that brought us hither who shall enslave us here what have
we to do with this mitred prelate with this crowned king what have
we to do with england

endicott gazed round at the excited countenances of the people now
full of his own spirit and then turned suddenly to the
standard-bearer who stood close behind him

officer lower your banner said he

the officer obeyed and brandishing his sword endicott thrust it
through the cloth and with his left hand rent the red cross completely
out of the banner he then waved the tattered ensign above his head

sacrilegious wretch cried the high-churchman in the pillory unable
longer to restrain himself thou hast rejected the symbol of our holy
religion

treason treason roared the royalist in the stocks he hath
defaced the king's banner

before god and man i will avouch the deed answered endicott beat
a flourish drummer shout soldiers and people in honor of the
ensign of new england neither pope nor tyrant hath part in it now

with a cry of triumph the people gave their sanction to one of the
boldest exploits which our history records and for ever honored be
the name of endicott we look back through the mist of ages and
recognize in the rending of the red cross from new england's banner
the first omen of that deliverance which our fathers consummated after
the bones of the stern puritan had lain more than a century in the
dust




the lily's quest

an apologue


two lovers once upon a time had planned a little summer-house in the
form of an antique temple which it was their purpose to consecrate to
all manner of refined and innocent enjoyments there they would hold
pleasant intercourse with one another and the circle of their familiar
friends there they would give festivals of delicious fruit there
they would hear lightsome music intermingled with the strains of
pathos which make joy more sweet there they would read poetry and
fiction and permit their own minds to flit away in day-dreams and
romance there in short for why should we shape out the vague
sunshine of their hopes there all pure delights were to cluster like
roses among the pillars of the edifice and blossom ever new and
spontaneously

so one breezy and cloudless afternoon adam forrester and lilias fay
set out upon a ramble over the wide estate which they were to possess
together seeking a proper site for their temple of happiness they
were themselves a fair and happy spectacle fit priest and priestess
for such a shrine although making poetry of the pretty name of
lilias adam forrester was wont to call her lily because her form
was as fragile and her cheek almost as pale as they passed hand in
hand down the avenue of drooping elms that led from the portal of
lilias fay's paternal mansion they seemed to glance like winged
creatures through the strips of sunshine and to scatter brightness
where the deep shadows fell

but setting forth at the same time with this youthful pair there was
a dismal figure wrapped in a black velvet cloak that might have been
made of a coffin-pall and with a sombre hat such as mourners wear
drooping its broad brim over his heavy brows glancing behind them
the lovers well knew who it was that followed but wished from their
hearts that he had been elsewhere as being a companion so strangely
unsuited to their joyous errand it was a near relative of lilias fay
an old man by the name of walter gascoigne who had long labored under
the burden of a melancholy spirit which was sometimes maddened into
absolute insanity and always had a tinge of it what a contrast
between the young pilgrims of bliss and their unbidden associate they
looked as if moulded of heaven's sunshine and he of earth's gloomiest
shade they flitted along like hope and joy roaming hand in hand
through life while his darksome figure stalked behind a type of all
the woeful influences which life could fling upon them

but the three had not gone far when they reached a spot that pleased
the gentle lily and she paused

what sweeter place shall we find than this said she why should we
seek farther for the site of our temple

it was indeed a delightful spot of earth though undistinguished by
any very prominent beauties being merely a nook in the shelter of a
hill with the prospect of a distant lake in one direction and of a
church-spire in another there were vistas and pathways leading onward
and onward into the green woodlands and vanishing away in the
glimmering shade the temple if erected here would look toward the
west so that the lovers could shape all sorts of magnificent dreams
out of the purple violet and gold of the sunset sky and few of their
anticipated pleasures were dearer than this sport of fantasy

yes said adam forrester we might seek all day and find no
lovelier spot we will build our temple here

but their sad old companion who had taken his stand on the very site
which they proposed to cover with a marble floor shook his head and
frowned and the young man and the lily deemed it almost enough to
blight the spot and desecrate it for their airy temple that his dismal
figure had thrown its shadow there he pointed to some scattered
stones the remnants of a former structure and to flowers such as
young girls delight to nurse in their gardens but which had now
relapsed into the wild simplicity of nature

not here cried old walter gascoigne here long ago other mortals
built their temple of happiness seek another site for yours

what exclaimed lilias fay have any ever planned such a temple
save ourselves

poor child said her gloomy kinsman in one shape or other every
mortal has dreamed your dream then he told the lovers how not
indeed an antique temple but a dwelling had once stood there and
that a dark-clad guest had dwelt among its inmates sitting for ever
at the fireside and poisoning all their household mirth

under this type adam forrester and lilias saw that the old man spake
of sorrow he told of nothing that might not be recorded in the
history of almost every household and yet his hearers felt as if no
sunshine ought to fall upon a spot where human grief had left so deep
a stain or at least that no joyous temple should be built there

this is very sad said the lily sighing

well there are lovelier spots than this said adam forrester
soothingly spots which sorrow has not blighted

so they hastened away and the melancholy gascoigne followed them
looking as if he had gathered up all the gloom of the deserted spot
and was bearing it as a burden of inestimable treasure but still they
rambled on and soon found themselves in a rocky dell through the
midst of which ran a streamlet with ripple and foam and a continual
voice of inarticulate joy it was a wild retreat walled on either side
with gray precipices which would have frowned somewhat too sternly had
not a profusion of green shrubbery rooted itself into their crevices
and wreathed gladsome foliage around their solemn brows but the chief
joy of the dell was in the little stream which seemed like the
presence of a blissful child with nothing earthly to do save to babble
merrily and disport itself and make every living soul its playfellow
and throw the sunny gleams of its spirit upon all

here here is the spot cried the two lovers with one voice as
they reached a level space on the brink of a small cascade this glen
was made on purpose for our temple

and the glad song of the brook will be always in our ears said
lilias fay

and its long melody shall sing the bliss of our lifetime said adam
forrester

ye must build no temple here murmured their dismal companion

and there again was the old lunatic standing just on the spot where
they meant to rear their lightsome dome and looking like the embodied
symbol of some great woe that in forgotten days had happened there
and alas there had been woe nor that alone a young man more than a
hundred years before had lured hither a girl that loved him and on
this spot had murdered her and washed his bloody hands in the stream
which sang so merrily and ever since the victim's death-shrieks were
often heard to echo between the cliffs

and see cried old gascoigne is the stream yet pure from the stain
of the murderer's hands

methinks it has a tinge of blood faintly answered the lily and
being as slight as the gossamer she trembled and clung to her lover's
arm whispering let us flee from this dreadful vale

come then said adam forrester as cheerily as he could we shall
soon find a happier spot

they set forth again young pilgrims on that quest which
millions which every child of earth has tried in turn

and were the lily and her lover to be more fortunate than all those
millions for a long time it seemed not so the dismal shape of the
old lunatic still glided behind them and for every spot that looked
lovely in their eyes he had some legend of human wrong or suffering so
miserably sad that his auditors could never afterward connect the idea
of joy with the place where it had happened here a heartbroken woman
kneeling to her child had been spurned from his feet here a desolate
old creature had prayed to the evil one and had received a fiendish
malignity of soul in answer to her prayer here a new-born infant
sweet blossom of life had been found dead with the impress of its
mother's fingers round its throat and here under a shattered oak
two lovers had been stricken by lightning and fell blackened corpses
in each other's arms the dreary gascoigne had a gift to know whatever
evil and lamentable thing had stained the bosom of mother earth and
when his funereal voice had told the tale it appeared like a prophecy
of future woe as well as a tradition of the past and now by their
sad demeanor you would have fancied that the pilgrim-lovers were
seeking not a temple of earthly joy but a tomb for themselves and
their posterity

where in this world exclaimed adam forrester despondingly shall
we build our temple of happiness

where in this world indeed repeated lilias fay and being faint
and weary the more so by the heaviness of her heart the lily drooped
her head and sat down on the summit of a knoll repeating where in
this world shall we build our temple

ah have you already asked yourselves that question said their
companion his shaded features growing even gloomier with the smile
that dwelt on them yet there is a place even in this world where ye
may build it

while the old man spoke adam forrester and lilias had carelessly
thrown their eyes around and perceived that the spot where they had
chanced to pause possessed a quiet charm which was well enough adapted
to their present mood of mind it was a small rise of ground with a
certain regularity of shape that had perhaps been bestowed by art and
a group of trees which almost surrounded it threw their pensive
shadows across and far beyond although some softened glory of the
sunshine found its way there the ancestral mansion wherein the lovers
would dwell together appeared on one side and the ivied church where
they were to worship on another happening to cast their eyes on the
ground they smiled yet with a sense of wonder to see that a pale
lily was growing at their feet

we will build our temple here said they simultaneously and with
an indescribable conviction that they had at last found the very spot

yet while they uttered this exclamation the young man and the lily
turned an apprehensive glance at their dreary associate deeming it
hardly possible that some tale of earthly affliction should not make
those precincts loathsome as in every former case the old man stood
just behind them so as to form the chief figure in the group with
his sable cloak muffling the lower part of his visage and his sombre
hat overshadowing his brows but he gave no word of dissent from their
purpose and an inscrutable smile was accepted by the lovers as a
token that here had been no footprint of guilt or sorrow to desecrate
the site of their temple of happiness

in a little time longer while summer was still in its prime the
fairy-structure of the temple arose on the summit of the knoll amid
the solemn shadows of the trees yet often gladdened with bright
sunshine it was built of white marble with slender and graceful
pillars supporting a vaulted dome and beneath the centre of this
dome upon a pedestal was a slab of dark-veined marble on which books
and music might be strewn but there was a fantasy among the people of
the neighborhood that the edifice was planned after an ancient
mausoleum and was intended for a tomb and that the central slab of
dark-veined marble was to be inscribed with the names of buried ones
they doubted too whether the form of lilias fay could appertain to a
creature of this earth being so very delicate and growing every day
more fragile so that she looked as if the summer breeze should snatch
her up and waft her heavenward but still she watched the daily growth
of the temple and so did old walter gascoigne who now made that spot
his continual haunt leaning whole hours together on his staff and
giving as deep attention to the work as though it had been indeed a
tomb in due time it was finished and a day appointed for a simple
rite of dedication

on the preceding evening after adam forrester had taken leave of his
mistress he looked back toward the portal of her dwelling and felt a
strange thrill of fear for he imagined that as the setting sunbeams
faded from her figure she was exhaling away and that something of her
ethereal substance was withdrawn with each lessening gleam of light
with his farewell glance a shadow had fallen over the portal and
lilias was invisible his foreboding spirit deemed it an omen at the
time and so it proved for the sweet earthly form by which the lily
had been manifested to the world was found lifeless the next morning
in the temple with her head resting on her arms which were folded
upon the slab of dark-veined marble the chill winds of the earth had
long since breathed a blight into this beautiful flower so that a
loving hand had now transplanted it to blossom brightly in the garden
of paradise

but alas for the temple of happiness in his unutterable grief adam
forrester had no purpose more at heart than to convert this temple of
many delightful hopes into a tomb and bury his dead mistress there
and lo a wonder digging a grave beneath the temple's marble floor
the sexton found no virgin earth such as was meet to receive the
maiden's dust but an ancient sepulchre in which were treasured up the
bones of generations that had died long ago among those forgotten
ancestors was the lily to be laid and when the funeral procession
brought lilias thither in her coffin they beheld old walter gascoigne
standing beneath the dome of the temple with his cloak of pall and
face of darkest gloom and wherever that figure might take its stand
the spot would seem a sepulchre he watched the mourners as they
lowered the coffin down

and so said he to adam forrester with the strange smile in which
his insanity was wont to gleam forth you have found no better
foundation for your happiness than on a grave

but as the shadow of affliction spoke a vision of hope and joy had its
birth in adam's mind even from the old man's taunting words for then
he knew what was betokened by the parable in which the lily and
himself had acted and the mystery of life and death was opened to
him

joy joy he cried throwing his arms toward heaven on a grave be
the site of our temple and now our happiness is for eternity

with those words a ray of sunshine broke through the dismal sky and
glimmered down into the sepulchre while at the same moment the shape
of old walter gascoigne stalked drearily away because his gloom
symbolic of all earthly sorrow might no longer abide there now that
the darkest riddle of humanity was read




footprints on the seashore


it must be a spirit much unlike my own which can keep itself in health
and vigor without sometimes stealing from the sultry sunshine of the
world to plunge into the cool bath of solitude at intervals and not
infrequent ones the forest and the ocean summon me one with the roar
of its waves the other with the murmur of its boughs forth from the
haunts of men but i must wander many a mile ere i could stand beneath
the shadow of even one primeval tree much less be lost among the
multitude of hoary trunks and hidden from the earth and sky by the
mystery of darksome foliage nothing is within my daily reach more
like a forest than the acre or two of woodland near some suburban
farmhouse when therefore the yearning for seclusion becomes a
necessity within me i am drawn to the seashore which extends its line
of rude rocks and seldom-trodden sands for leagues around our bay
setting forth at my last ramble on a september morning i bound myself
with a hermit's vow to interchange no thoughts with man or woman to
share no social pleasure but to derive all that day's enjoyment from
shore and sea and sky from my soul's communion with these and from
fantasies and recollections or anticipated realities surely here is
enough to feed a human spirit for a single day farewell then busy
world till your evening lights shall shine along the street till
they gleam upon my sea-flushed face as i tread homeward free me from
your ties and let me be a peaceful outlaw

highways and cross-paths are hastily traversed and clambering down a
crag i find myself at the extremity of a long beach how gladly does
the spirit leap forth and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to the
full extent of the broad blue sunny deep a greeting and a homage to
the sea i descend over its margin and dip my hand into the wave that
meets me and bathe my brow that far-resounding roar is ocean's voice
of welcome his salt breath brings a blessing along with it now let
us pace together the reader's fancy arm in arm with mine this noble
beach which extends a mile or more from that craggy promontory to
yonder rampart of broken rocks in front the sea in the rear a
precipitous bank the grassy verge of which is breaking away year after
year and flings down its tufts of verdure upon the barrenness below
the beach itself is a broad space of sand brown and sparkling with
hardly any pebbles intermixed near the water's edge there is a wet
margin which glistens brightly in the sunshine and reflects objects
like a mirror and as we tread along the glistening border a dry spot
flashes around each footstep but grows moist again as we lift our
feet in some spots the sand receives a complete impression of the
sole square toe and all elsewhere it is of such marble firmness that
we must stamp heavily to leave a print even of the iron-shod heel
along the whole of this extensive beach gambols the surf-wave now it
makes a feint of dashing onward in a fury yet dies away with a meek
murmur and does but kiss the strand now after many such abortive
efforts it rears itself up in an unbroken line heightening as it
advances without a speck of foam on its green crest with how fierce
a roar it flings itself forward and rushes far up the beach

as i threw my eyes along the edge of the surf i remember that i was
startled as robinson crusoe might have been by the sense that human
life was within the magic circle of my solitude afar off in the
remote distance of the beach appearing like sea-nymphs or some
airier things such as might tread upon the feathery spray was a group
of girls hardly had i beheld them when they passed into the shadow
of the rocks and vanished to comfort myself for truly i would fain
have gazed a while longer i made acquaintance with a flock of
beach-birds these little citizens of the sea and air preceded me by
about a stone's-throw along the strand seeking i suppose for food
upon its margin yet with a philosophy which mankind would do well to
imitate they drew a continual pleasure from their toil for a
subsistence the sea was each little bird's great playmate they
chased it downward as it swept back and again ran up swiftly before
the impending wave which sometimes overtook them and bore them off
their feet but they floated as lightly as one of their own feathers
on the breaking crest in their airy flutterings they seemed to rest
on the evanescent spray their images long-legged little figures with
gray backs and snowy bosoms were seen as distinctly as the realities
in the mirror of the glistening strand as i advanced they flew a
score or two of yards and again alighting recommenced their
dalliance with the surf-wave and thus they bore me company along the
beach the types of pleasant fantasies till at its extremity they
took wing over the ocean and were gone after forming a friendship
with these small surf-spirits it is really worth a sigh to find no
memorial of them save their multitudinous little tracks in the sand

when we have paced the length of the beach it is pleasant and not
unprofitable to retrace our steps and recall the whole mood and
occupation of the mind during the former passage our tracks being
all discernible will guide us with an observing consciousness through
every unconscious wandering of thought and fancy here we followed the
surf in its reflux to pick up a shell which the sea seemed loth to
relinquish here we found a seaweed with an immense brown leaf and
trailed it behind us by its long snake-like stalk here we seized a
live horseshoe by the tail and counted the many claws of that queer
monster here we dug into the sand for pebbles and skipped them upon
the surface of the water here we wet our feet while examining a
jelly-fish which the waves having just tossed it up now sought to
snatch away again here we trod along the brink of a fresh-water
brooklet which flows across the beach becoming shallower and more
shallow till at last it sinks into the sand and perishes in the
effort to bear its little tribute to the main here some vagary
appears to have bewildered us for our tracks go round and round and
are confusedly intermingled as if we had found a labyrinth upon the
level beach and here amid our idle pastime we sat down upon almost
the only stone that breaks the surface of the sand and were lost in
an unlooked-for and overpowering conception of the majesty and
awfulness of the great deep thus by tracking our footprints in the
sand we track our own nature in its wayward course and steal a glance
upon it when it never dreams of being so observed such glances always
make us wiser

this extensive beach affords room for another pleasant pastime with
your staff you may write verses love-verses if they please you
best and consecrate them with a woman's name here too may be
inscribed thoughts feelings desires warm outgushings from the
heart's secret places which you would not pour upon the sand without
the certainty that almost ere the sky has looked upon them the sea
will wash them out stir not hence till the record be effaced now
for there is room enough on your canvas draw huge faces huge as
that of the sphynx on egyptian sands and fit them with bodies of
corresponding immensity and legs which might stride halfway to yonder
island child's-play becomes magnificent on so grand a scale but
after all the most fascinating employment is simply to write your
name in the sand draw the letters gigantic so that two strides may
barely measure them and three for the long strokes cut deep that
the record may be permanent statesmen and warriors and poets have
spent their strength in no better cause than this is it accomplished
return then in an hour or two and seek for this mighty record of a
name the sea will have swept over it even as time rolls its effacing
waves over the names of statesmen and warriors and poets hark the
surf-wave laughs at you

passing from the beach i begin to clamber over the crags making my
difficult way among the ruins of a rampart shattered and broken by the
assaults of a fierce enemy the rocks rise in every variety of
attitude some of them have their feet in the foam and are shagged
halfway upward with seaweed some have been hollowed almost into
caverns by the unwearied toil of the sea which can afford to spend
centuries in wearing away a rock or even polishing a pebble one huge
rock ascends in monumental shape with a face like a giant's
tombstone on which the veins resemble inscriptions but in an unknown
tongue we will fancy them the forgotten characters of an antediluvian
race or else that nature's own hand has here recorded a mystery
which could i read her language would make mankind the wiser and the
happier how many a thing has troubled me with that same idea pass on
and leave it unexplained here is a narrow avenue which might seem to
have been hewn through the very heart of an enormous crag affording
passage for the rising sea to thunder back and forth filling it with
tumultuous foam and then leaving its floor of black pebbles bare and
glistening in this chasm there was once an intersecting vein of
softer stone which the waves have gnawed away piecemeal while the
granite walls remain entire on either side how sharply and with what
harsh clamor does the sea rake back the pebbles as it momentarily
withdraws into its own depths at intervals the floor of the chasm is
left nearly dry but anon at the outlet two or three great waves are
seen struggling to get in at once two hit the walls athwart while
one rushes straight through and all three thunder as if with rage and
triumph they heap the chasm with a snow-drift of foam and spray
while watching this scene i can never rid myself of the idea that a
monster endowed with life and fierce energy is striving to burst his
way through the narrow pass and what a contrast to look through the
stormy chasm and catch a glimpse of the calm bright sea beyond

many interesting discoveries may be made among these broken cliffs
once for example i found a dead seal which a recent tempest had
tossed into the nook of the rocks where his shaggy carcase lay rolled
in a heap of eel-grass as if the sea-monster sought to hide himself
from my eye another time a shark seemed on the point of leaping from
the surf to swallow me nor did i wholly without dread approach near
enough to ascertain that the man-eater had already met his own death
from some fisherman in the bay in the same ramble i encountered a
bird a large gray bird but whether a loon or a wild goose or the
identical albatross of the ancient mariner was beyond my ornithology
to decide it reposed so naturally on a bed of dry seaweed with its
head beside its wing that i almost fancied it alive and trod softly
lest it should suddenly spread its wings skyward but the sea-bird
would soar among the clouds no more nor ride upon its native waves
so i drew near and pulled out one of its mottled tail-feathers for a
remembrance another day i discovered an immense bone wedged into a
chasm of the rocks it was at least ten feet long curved like a
scymitar bejewelled with barnacles and small shellfish and partly
covered with a growth of seaweed some leviathan of former ages had
used this ponderous mass as a jaw-bone curiosities of a minuter order
may be observed in a deep reservoir which is replenished with water at
every tide but becomes a lake among the crags save when the sea is at
its height at the bottom of this rocky basin grow marine plants some
of which tower high beneath the water and cast a shadow in the
sunshine small fishes dart to and fro and hide themselves among the
seaweed there is also a solitary crab who appears to lead the life of
a hermit communing with none of the other denizens of the place and
likewise several five-fingers for i know no other name than that
which children give them if your imagination be at all accustomed to
such freaks you may look down into the depths of this pool and fancy
it the mysterious depth of ocean but where are the hulks and
scattered timbers of sunken ships where the treasures that old ocean
hoards where the corroded cannon where the corpses and skeletons of
seamen who went down in storm and battle

on the day of my last ramble it was a september day yet as warm as
summer what should i behold as i approached the above-described basin
but three girls sitting on its margin and yes it is veritably
so laving their snowy feet in the sunny water these these are the
warm realities of those three visionary shapes that flitted from me on
the beach hark their merry voices as they toss up the water with
their feet they have not seen me i must shrink behind this rock and
steal away again

in honest truth vowed to solitude as i am there is something in this
encounter that makes the heart flutter with a strangely pleasant
sensation i know these girls to be realities of flesh and blood yet
glancing at them so briefly they mingle like kindred creatures with
the ideal beings of my mind it is pleasant likewise to gaze down
from some high crag and watch a group of children gathering pebbles
and pearly shells and playing with the surf as with old ocean's hoary
beard nor does it infringe upon my seclusion to see yonder boat at
anchor off the shore swinging dreamily to and fro and rising and
sinking with the alternate swell while the crew four gentlemen in
roundabout jackets are busy with their fishing-lines but with an
inward antipathy and a headlong flight do i eschew the presence of any
meditative stroller like myself known by his pilgrim-staff his
sauntering step his shy demeanor his observant yet abstracted eye

from such a man as if another self had scared me i scramble hastily
over the rocks and take refuge in a nook which many a secret hour has
given me a right to call my own i would do battle for it even with
the churl that should produce the title-deeds have not my musings
melted into its rocky walls and sandy floor and made them a portion of
myself it is a recess in the line of cliffs walled round by a rough
high precipice which almost encircles and shuts in a little space of
sand in front the sea appears as between the pillars of a portal in
the rear the precipice is broken and intermixed with earth which gives
nourishment not only to clinging and twining shrubs but to trees that
grip the rock with their naked roots and seem to struggle hard for
footing and for soil enough to live upon these are fir trees but
oaks hang their heavy branches from above and throw down acorns on
the beach and shed their withering foliage upon the waves at this
autumnal season the precipice is decked with variegated splendor
trailing wreaths of scarlet flaunt from the summit downward tufts of
yellow-flowering shrubs and rose-bushes with their reddened leaves
and glossy seed-berries sprout from each crevice at every glance i
detect some new light or shade of beauty all contrasting with the
stern gray rock a rill of water trickles down the cliff and fills a
little cistern near the base i drain it at a draught and find it
fresh and pure this recess shall be my dining-hall and what the
feast a few biscuits made savory by soaking them in sea-water a tuft
of samphire gathered from the beach and an apple for the dessert by
this time the little rill has filled its reservoir again and as i
quaff it i thank god more heartily than for a civic banquet that he
gives me the healthful appetite to make a feast of bread and water

dinner being over i throw myself at length upon the sand and basking
in the sunshine let my mind disport itself at will the walls of this
my hermitage have no tongue to tell my follies though i sometimes
fancy that they have ears to hear them and a soul to sympathize there
is a magic in this spot dreams haunt its precincts and flit around me
in broad sunlight nor require that sleep shall blindfold me to real
objects ere these be visible here can i frame a story of two lovers
and make their shadows live before me and be mirrored in the tranquil
water as they tread along the sand leaving no footprints here
should i will it i can summon up a single shade and be myself her
lover yes dreamer but your lonely heart will be the colder for
such fancies sometimes too the past comes back and finds me here
and in her train come faces which were gladsome when i knew them yet
seem not gladsome now would that my hiding-place were lonelier so
that the past might not find me get ye all gone old friends and
let me listen to the murmur of the sea a melancholy voice but less
sad than yours of what mysteries is it telling of sunken ships and
whereabouts they lie of islands afar and undiscovered whose tawny
children are unconscious of other islands and of continents and deem
the stars of heaven their nearest neighbors nothing of all this
what then has it talked for so many ages and meant nothing all the
while no for those ages find utterance in the sea's unchanging
voice and warn the listener to withdraw his interest from mortal
vicissitudes and let the infinite idea of eternity pervade his soul
this is wisdom and therefore will i spend the next half-hour in
shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across
the cove with the feather of a sea-gull for a sail if the voice of
ages tell me true this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of
five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main bound to far
cathay yet how would the merchant sneer at me

and after all can such philosophy be true methinks i could find a
thousand arguments against it well then let yonder shaggy rock
mid-deep in the surf see he is somewhat wrathful he rages and roars
and foams let that tall rock be my antagonist and let me exercise
my oratory like him of athens who bandied words with an angry sea and
got the victory my maiden-speech is a triumphant one for the
gentleman in seaweed has nothing to offer in reply save an immitigable
roaring his voice indeed will be heard a long while after mine is
hushed once more i shout and the cliffs reverberate the sound oh
what joy for a shy man to feel himself so solitary that he may lift
his voice to its highest pitch without hazard of a listener but
hush be silent my good friend whence comes that stifled laughter
it was musical but how should there be such music in my solitude
looking upward i catch a glimpse of three faces peeping from the
summit of the cliff like angels between me and their native sky ah
fair girls you may make yourself merry at my eloquence but it was my
turn to smile when i saw your white feet in the pool let us keep each
other's secrets

the sunshine has now passed from my hermitage except a gleam upon the
sand just where it meets the sea a crowd of gloomy fantasies will
come and haunt me if i tarry longer here in the darkening twilight of
these gray rocks this is a dismal place in some moods of the mind
climb we therefore the precipice and pause a moment on the brink
gazing down into that hollow chamber by the deep where we have been
what few can be sufficient to our own pastime yes say the word
outright self-sufficient to our own happiness how lonesome looks the
recess now and dreary too like all other spots where happiness has
been there lies my shadow in the departing sunshine with its head
upon the sea i will pelt it with pebbles a hit a hit i clap my
hands in triumph and see my shadow clapping its unreal hands and
claiming the triumph for itself what a simpleton must i have been all
day since my own shadow makes a mock of my fooleries

homeward homeward it is time to hasten home it is time it is time
for as the sun sinks over the western wave the sea grows melancholy
and the surf has a saddened tone the distant sails appear astray and
not of earth in their remoteness amid the desolate waste my spirit
wanders forth afar but finds no resting-place and comes shivering
back it is time that i were hence but grudge me not the day that has
been spent in seclusion which yet was not solitude since the great
sea has been my companion and the little sea-birds my friends and
the wind has told me his secrets and airy shapes have flitted around
me in my hermitage such companionship works an effect upon a man's
character as if he had been admitted to the society of creatures that
are not mortal and when at noontide i tread the crowded streets
the influence of this day will still be felt so that i shall walk
among men kindly and as a brother with affection and sympathy but
yet shall not melt into the indistinguishable mass of humankind i
shall think my own thoughts and feel my own emotions and possess my
individuality unviolated

but it is good at the eve of such a day to feel and know that there
are men and women in the world that feeling and that knowledge are
mine at this moment for on the shore far below me the fishing-party
have landed from their skiff and are cooking their scaly prey by a
fire of driftwood kindled in the angle of two rude rocks the three
visionary girls are likewise there in the deepening twilight while
the surf is dashing near their hearth the ruddy gleam of the fire
throws a strange air of comfort over the wild cove bestrewn as it is
with pebbles and seaweed and exposed to the melancholy main
moreover as the smoke climbs up the precipice it brings with it a
savory smell from a pan of fried fish and a black kettle of chowder
and reminds me that my dinner was nothing but bread and water and a
tuft of samphire and an apple methinks the party might find room for
another guest at that flat rock which serves them for a table and if
spoons be scarce i could pick up a clam-shell on the beach they see
me now and the blessing of a hungry man upon him one of them sends
up a hospitable shout halloo sir solitary come down and sup with
us the ladies wave their handkerchiefs can i decline no and be it
owned after all my solitary joys that this is the sweetest moment of
a day by the seashore




edward fane's rosebud


there is hardly a more difficult exercise of fancy than while gazing
at a figure of melancholy age to recreate its youth and without
entirely obliterating the identity of form and features to restore
those graces which time has snatched away some old people especially
women so age-worn and woeful are they seem never to have been young
and gay it is easier to conceive that such gloomy phantoms were sent
into the world as withered and decrepit as we behold them now with
sympathies only for pain and grief to watch at death-beds and weep at
funerals even the sable garments of their widowhood appear essential
to their existence all their attributes combine to render them
darksome shadows creeping strangely amid the sunshine of human life
yet it is no unprofitable task to take one of these doleful creatures
and set fancy resolutely at work to brighten the dim eye and darken
the silvery locks and paint the ashen cheek with rose-color and
repair the shrunken and crazy form till a dewy maiden shall be seen
in the old matron's elbow-chair the miracle being wrought then let
the years roll back again each sadder than the last and the whole
weight of age and sorrow settle down upon the youthful figure
wrinkles and furrows the handwriting of time may thus be deciphered
and found to contain deep lessons of thought and feeling

such profit might be derived by a skilful observer from my
much-respected friend the widow toothaker a nurse of great repute who
has breathed the atmosphere of sick-chambers and dying-breaths these
forty years see she sits cowering over her lonesome hearth with her
gown and upper petticoat drawn upward gathering thriftily into her
person the whole warmth of the fire which now at nightfall begins to
dissipate the autumnal chill of her chamber the blaze quivers
capriciously in front alternately glimmering into the deepest chasms
of her wrinkled visage and then permitting a ghostly dimness to mar
the outlines of her venerable figure and nurse toothaker holds a
teaspoon in her right hand with which to stir up the contents of a
tumbler in her left whence steams a vapory fragrance abhorred of
temperance societies now she sips now stirs now sips again her sad
old heart has need to be revived by the rich infusion of geneva which
is mixed half and half with hot water in the tumbler all day long she
has been sitting by a death-pillow and quitted it for her home only
when the spirit of her patient left the clay and went homeward too
but now are her melancholy meditations cheered and her torpid blood
warmed and her shoulders lightened of at least twenty ponderous years
by a draught from the true fountain of youth in a case-bottle it is
strange that men should deem that fount a fable when its liquor fills
more bottles than the congress-water sip it again good nurse and
see whether a second draught will not take off another score of years
and perhaps ten more and show us in your high-backed chair the
blooming damsel who plighted troths with edward fane get you gone
age and widowhood come back unwedded youth but alas the charm
will not work in spite of fancy's most potent spell i can see only
an old dame cowering over the fire a picture of decay and desolation
while the november blast roars at her in the chimney and fitful
showers rush suddenly against the window

yet there was a time when rose grafton such was the pretty
maiden-name of nurse toothaker possessed beauty that would have
gladdened this dim and dismal chamber as with sunshine it won for her
the heart of edward fane who has since made so great a figure in the
world and is now a grand old gentleman with powdered hair and as gouty
as a lord these early lovers thought to have walked hand in hand
through life they had wept together for edward's little sister mary
whom rose tended in her sickness partly because she was the sweetest
child that ever lived or died but more for love of him she was but
three years old being such an infant death could not embody his
terrors in her little corpse nor did rose fear to touch the dead
child's brow though chill as she curled the silken hair around it
nor to take her tiny hand and clasp a flower within its fingers
afterward when she looked through the pane of glass in the coffin-lid
and beheld mary's face it seemed not so much like death or life as
like a wax-work wrought into the perfect image of a child asleep and
dreaming of its mother's smile rose thought her too fair a thing to
be hidden in the grave and wondered that an angel did not snatch up
little mary's coffin and bear the slumbering babe to heaven and bid
her wake immortal but when the sods were laid on little mary the
heart of rose was troubled she shuddered at the fantasy that in
grasping the child's cold fingers her virgin hand had exchanged a
first greeting with mortality and could never lose the earthy taint
how many a greeting since but as yet she was a fair young girl with
the dewdrops of fresh feeling in her bosom and instead of
rose which seemed too mature a name for her half-opened beauty her
lover called her rosebud

the rosebud was destined never to bloom for edward fane his mother
was a rich and haughty dame with all the aristocratic prejudices of
colonial times she scorned rose grafton's humble parentage and caused
her son to break his faith though had she let him choose he would
have prized his rosebud above the richest diamond the lovers parted
and have seldom met again both may have visited the same mansions
but not at the same time for one was bidden to the festal hall and
the other to the sick-chamber he was the guest of pleasure and
prosperity and she of anguish rose after their separation was long
secluded within the dwelling of mr toothaker whom she married with
the revengeful hope of breaking her false lover's heart she went to
her bridegroom's arms with bitterer tears they say than young girls
ought to shed at the threshold of the bridal-chamber yet though her
husband's head was getting gray and his heart had been chilled with an
autumnal frost rose soon began to love him and wondered at her own
conjugal affection he was all she had to love there were no
children

in a year or two poor mr toothaker was visited with a wearisome
infirmity which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a
child he crept forth about his business and came home at dinner-time
and eventide not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife's heart
but slowly feebly jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy
dub of his staff we must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes
blushed to own him her visitors when they heard him coming looked
for the appearance of some old old man but he dragged his nerveless
limbs into the parlor and there was mr toothaker the disease
increasing he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his
right hand and his left on his wife's shoulder bearing heavily
downward like a dead man's hand thus a slender woman still looking
maiden-like she supported his tall broad-chested frame along the
pathway of their little garden and plucked the roses for her
gray-haired husband and spoke soothingly as to an infant his mind
was palsied with his body its utmost energy was peevishness in a few
months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every
step and a longer one upon the landing-place and a heavy glance
behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber he knew poor man
that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his
world his world his home his tomb at once a dwelling-and a
burial-place till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one but
rose was with him in the tomb he leaned upon her in his daily passage
from the bed to the chair by the fireside and back again from the
weary chair to the joyless bed his bed and hers their
marriage-bed till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all
day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it how long poor mr
toothaker was kept in misery death seemed to draw near the door and
often to lift the latch and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into
the chamber nodding to rose and pointing at her husband but still
delayed to enter this bedridden wretch cannot escape me quoth
death i will go forth and run a race with the swift and fight a
battle with the strong and come back for toothaker at my leisure
oh when the deliverer came so near in the dull anguish of her
worn-out sympathies did she never long to cry death come in

but no we have no right to ascribe such a wish to our friend rose
she never failed in a wife's duty to her poor sick husband she
murmured not though a glimpse of the sunny sky was as strange to her
as him nor answered peevishly though his complaining accents roused
her from sweetest dream only to share his wretchedness he knew her
faith yet nourished a cankered jealousy and when the slow disease
had chilled all his heart save one lukewarm spot which death's frozen
fingers were searching for his last words were what would my rose
have done for her first love if she has been so true and kind to a
sick old man like me and then his poor soul crept away and left the
body lifeless though hardly more so than for years before and rose a
widow though in truth it was the wedding-night that widowed her she
felt glad it must be owned when mr toothaker was buried because
his corpse had retained such a likeness to the man half alive that she
hearkened for the sad murmur of his voice bidding her shift his
pillow but all through the next winter though the grave had held him
many a month she fancied him calling from that cold bed rose rose
come put a blanket on my feet

so now the rosebud was the widow toothaker her troubles had come
early and tedious as they seemed had passed before all her bloom
was fled she was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor or with a
widow's cheerful gravity she might have won a widower stealing into
his heart in the very guise of his dead wife but the widow toothaker
had no such projects by her watchings and continual cares her heart
had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed
its very nature and made her love him for his infirmities and
infirmity for his sake when the palsied old man was gone even her
early lover could not have supplied his place she had dwelt in a
sick-chamber and been the companion of a half-dead wretch till she
could scarcely breathe in a free air and felt ill at ease with the
healthy and the happy she missed the fragrance of the doctor's stuff
she walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall if visitors came in
she spoke in soft and soothing accents and was startled and shocked
by their loud voices often in the lonesome evening she looked
timorously from the fireside to the bed with almost a hope of
recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow then went her thoughts
sadly to her husband's grave if one impatient throb had wronged him
in his lifetime if she had secretly repined because her buoyant youth
was imprisoned with his torpid age if ever while slumbering beside
him a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heart yet the
sick man had been preparing a revenge which the dead now claimed on
his painful pillow he had cast a spell around her his groans and
misery had proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful
grace in his semblance disease itself had won the rosebud for a
bride nor could his death dissolve the nuptials by that indissoluble
bond she had gained a home in every sick-chamber and nowhere else
there were her brethren and sisters thither her husband summoned her
with that voice which had seemed to issue from the grave of toothaker
at length she recognized her destiny

we have beheld her as the maid the wife the widow now we see her in
a separate and insulated character she was in all her attributes
nurse toothaker and nurse toothaker alone with her own shrivelled
lips could make known her experience in that capacity what a history
might she record of the great sicknesses in which she has gone hand in
hand with the exterminating angel she remembers when the small-pox
hoisted a red banner on almost every house along the street she has
witnessed when the typhus fever swept off a whole household young and
old all but a lonely mother who vainly shrieked to follow her last
loved one where would be death's triumph if none lived to weep she
can speak of strange maladies that have broken out as if
spontaneously but were found to have been imported from foreign lands
with rich silks and other merchandise the costliest portion of the
cargo and once she recollects the people died of what was
considered a new pestilence till the doctors traced it to the ancient
grave of a young girl who thus caused many deaths a hundred years
after her own burial strange that such black mischief should lurk in
a maiden's grave she loves to tell how strong men fight with fiery
fevers utterly refusing to give up their breath and how consumptive
virgins fade out of the world scarcely reluctant as if their lovers
were wooing them to a far country tell us thou fearful woman tell
us the death-secrets fain would i search out the meaning of words
faintly gasped with intermingled sobs and broken sentences
half-audibly spoken between earth and the judgment-seat

an awful woman she is the patron-saint of young physicians and the
bosom-friend of old ones in the mansions where she enters the inmates
provide themselves black garments the coffin-maker follows her and
the bell tolls as she comes away from the threshold death himself has
met her at so many a bedside that he puts forth his bony hand to greet
nurse toothaker she is an awful woman and oh is it conceivable that
this handmaid of human infirmity and affliction so darkly stained so
thoroughly imbued with all that is saddest in the doom of mortals can
ever again be bright and gladsome even though bathed in the sunshine
of eternity by her long communion with woe has she not forfeited her
inheritance of immortal joy does any germ of bliss survive within
her

hark an eager knocking st nurse toothaker's door she starts from her
drowsy reverie sets aside the empty tumbler and teaspoon and lights
a lamp at the dim embers of the fire rap rap rap again and she
hurries adown the staircase wondering which of her friends can be at
death's door now since there is such an earnest messenger at nurse
toothaker's again the peal resounds just as her hand is on the lock
be quick nurse toothaker cries a man on the doorstep old general
fane is taken with the gout in his stomach and has sent for you to
watch by his death-bed make haste for there is no time to
lose fane edward fane and has he sent for me at last i am
ready i will get on my cloak and begone so adds the sable-gowned
ashen-visaged funereal old figure edward fane remembers his
rosebud

our question is answered there is a germ of bliss within her her
long-hoarded constancy her memory of the bliss that was remaining
amid the gloom of her after-life like a sweet-smelling flower in a
coffin is a symbol that all may be renewed in some happier clime the
rosebud may revive again with all the dewdrops in its bosom




the threefold destiny

a fa√´ry legend


i have sometimes produced a singular and not unpleasing effect so far
as my own mind was concerned by imagining a train of incidents in
which the spirit and mechanism of the fa√´ry legend should be combined
with the characters and manners of familiar life in the little tale
which follows a subdued tinge of the wild and wonderful is thrown over
a sketch of new england personages and scenery yet it is hoped
without entirely obliterating the sober hues of nature rather than a
story of events claiming to be real it may be considered as an
allegory such as the writers of the last century would have expressed
in the shape of an eastern tale but to which i have endeavored to
give a more lifelike warmth than could be infused into those fanciful
productions

in the twilight of a summer eve a tall dark figure over which long and
remote travel had thrown an outlandish aspect was entering a village
not in fa√´ry londe but within our own familiar boundaries the
staff on which this traveller leaned had been his companion from the
spot where it grew in the jungles of hindostan the hat that
overshadowed his sombre brow had shielded him from the suns of spain
but his cheek had been blackened by the red-hot wind of an arabian
desert and had felt the frozen breath of an arctic region long
sojourning amid wild and dangerous men he still wore beneath his vest
the ataghan which he had once struck into the throat of a turkish
robber in every foreign clime he had lost something of his new
england characteristics and perhaps from every people he had
unconsciously borrowed a new peculiarity so that when the
world-wanderer again trod the street of his native village it is no
wonder that he passed unrecognized though exciting the gaze and
curiosity of all yet as his arm casually touched that of a young
woman who was wending her way to an evening lecture she started and
almost uttered a cry

ralph cranfield was the name that she half articulated

can that be my old playmate faith egerton thought the traveller
looking round at her figure but without pausing

ralph cranfield from his youth upward had felt himself marked out for
a high destiny he had imbibed the idea we say not whether it were
revealed to him by witchcraft or in a dream of prophecy or that his
brooding fancy had palmed its own dictates upon him as the oracles of
a sybil but he had imbibed the idea and held it firmest among his
articles of faith that three marvellous events of his life were to be
confirmed to him by three signs

the first of these three fatalities and perhaps the one on which his
youthful imagination had dwelt most fondly was the discovery of the
maid who alone of all the maids on earth could make him happy by her
love he was to roam around the world till he should meet a beautiful
woman wearing on her bosom a jewel in the shape of a heart whether of
pearl or ruby or emerald or carbuncle or a changeful opal or perhaps
a priceless diamond ralph cranfield little cared so long as it were
a heart of one peculiar shape on encountering this lovely stranger he
was bound to address her thus maiden i have brought you a heavy
heart may i rest its weight on you and if she were his fated
bride if their kindred souls were destined to form a union here below
which all eternity should only bind more closely she would reply
with her finger on the heart-shaped jewel this token which i have
worn so long is the assurance that you may

and secondly ralph cranfield had a firm belief that there was a
mighty treasure hidden somewhere in the earth of which the
burial-place would be revealed to none but him when his feet should
press upon the mysterious spot there would be a hand before him
pointing downward whether carved of marble or hewn in gigantic
dimensions on the side of a rocky precipice or perchance a hand of
flame in empty air he could not tell but at least he would discern a
hand the forefinger pointing downward and beneath it the latin word
effode dig and digging thereabouts the gold in coin or
ingots the precious stones or of whatever else the treasure might
consist would be certain to reward his toil

the third and last of the miraculous events in the life of this
high-destined man was to be the attainment of extensive influence and
sway over his fellow-creatures whether he were to be a king and
founder of a hereditary throne or the victorious leader of a people
contending for their freedom or the apostle of a purified and
regenerated faith was left for futurity to show as messengers of the
sign by which ralph cranfield might recognize the summons three
venerable men were to claim audience of him the chief among them a
dignified and majestic person arrayed it may be supposed in the
flowing garments of an ancient sage would be the bearer of a wand or
prophet's rod with this wand or rod or staff the venerable sage would
trace a certain figure in the air and then proceed to make known his
heaven-instructed message which if obeyed must lead to glorious
results

with this proud fate before him in the flush of his imaginative youth
ralph cranfield had set forth to seek the maid the treasure and the
venerable sage with his gift of extended empire and had he found
them alas it was not with the aspect of a triumphant man who had
achieved a nobler destiny than all his fellows but rather with the
gloom of one struggling against peculiar and continual adversity that
he now passed homeward to his mother's cottage he had come back but
only for a time to lay aside the pilgrim's staff trusting that his
weary manhood would regain somewhat of the elasticity of youth in the
spot where his threefold fate had been foreshown him there had been
few changes in the village for it was not one of those thriving
places where a year's prosperity makes more than the havoc of a
century's decay but like a gray hair in a young man's head an
antiquated little town full of old maids and aged elms and moss-grown
dwellings few seemed to be the changes here the drooping elms
indeed had a more majestic spread the weather-blackened houses were
adorned with a denser thatch of verdant moss and doubtless there were
a few more gravestones in the burial-ground inscribed with names that
had once been familiar in the village street yet summing up all the
mischief that ten years had wrought it seemed scarcely more than if
ralph cranfield had gone forth that very morning and dreamed a
day-dream till the twilight and then turned back again but his heart
grew cold because the village did not remember him as he remembered
the village

here is the change sighed he striking his hand upon his breast
who is this man of thought and care weary with world-wandering and
heavy with disappointed hopes the youth returns not who went forth so
joyously

and now ralph cranfield was at his mother's gate in front of the
small house where the old lady with slender but sufficient means had
kept herself comfortable during her son's long absence admitting
himself within the enclosure he leaned against a great old tree
trifling with his own impatience as people often do in those intervals
when years are summed into a moment he took a minute survey of the
dwelling its windows brightened with the sky-gleam its doorway with
the half of a millstone for a step and the faintly-traced path waving
thence to the gate he made friends again with his childhood's
friend the old tree against which he leaned and glancing his eye
down its trunk beheld something that excited a melancholy smile it
was a half-obliterated inscription the latin word effode which
he remembered to have carved in the bark of the tree with a whole
day's toil when he had first begun to muse about his exalted destiny
it might be accounted a rather singular coincidence that the bark just
above the inscription had put forth an excrescence shaped not unlike a
hand with the forefinger pointing obliquely at the word of fate
such at least was its appearance in the dusky light

now a credulous man said ralph cranfield carelessly to himself
might suppose that the treasure which i have sought round the world
lies buried after all at the very door of my mother's dwelling that
would be a jest indeed

more he thought not about the matter for now the door was opened and
an elderly woman appeared on the threshold peering into the dusk to
discover who it might be that had intruded on her premises and was
standing in the shadow of her tree it was ralph cranfield's mother
pass we over their greeting and leave the one to her joy and the
other to his rest if quiet rest he found

but when morning broke he arose with a troubled brow for his sleep
and his wakefulness had alike been full of dreams all the fervor was
rekindled with which he had burned of yore to unravel the threefold
mystery of his fate the crowd of his early visions seemed to have
awaited him beneath his mother's roof and thronged riotously around to
welcome his return in the well-remembered chamber on the pillow
where his infancy had slumbered he had passed a wilder night than
ever in an arab tent or when he had reposed his head in the ghastly
shades of a haunted forest a shadowy maid had stolen to his bedside
and laid her finger on the scintillating heart a hand of flame had
glowed amid the darkness pointing downward to a mystery within the
earth a hoary sage had waved his prophetic wand and beckoned the
dreamer onward to a chair of state the same phantoms though fainter
in the daylight still flitted about the cottage and mingled among
the crowd of familiar faces that were drawn thither by the news of
ralph cranfield's return to bid him welcome for his mother's sake
there they found him a tall dark stately man of foreign aspect
courteous in demeanor and mild of speech yet with an abstracted eye
which seemed often to snatch a glance at the invisible

meantime the widow cranfield went bustling about the house full of
joy that she again had somebody to love and be careful of and for
whom she might vex and tease herself with the petty troubles of daily
life it was nearly noon when she looked forth from the door and
descried three personages of note coming along the street through the
hot sunshine and the masses of elm-tree shade at length they reached
her gate and undid the latch

see ralph exclaimed she with maternal pride here is squire
hawkwood and the two other selectmen coming on purpose to see you
now do tell them a good long story about what you have seen in
foreign parts

the foremost of the three visitors squire hawkwood was a very
pompous but excellent old gentleman the head and prime-mover in all
the affairs of the village and universally acknowledged to be one of
the sagest men on earth he wore according to a fashion even then
becoming antiquated a three-cornered hat and carried a silver-headed
cane the use of which seemed to be rather for flourishing in the air
than for assisting the progress of his legs his two companions were
elderly and respectable yeomen who retaining an ante-revolutionary
reverence for rank and hereditary wealth kept a little in the
squire's rear

as they approached along the pathway ralph cranfield sat in an oaken
elbow-chair half unconsciously gazing at the three visitors and
enveloping their homely figures in the misty romance that pervaded his
mental world here thought he smiling at the conceit here come
three elderly personages and the first of the three is a venerable
sage with a staff what if this embassy should bring me the message of
my fate

while squire hawkwood and his colleagues entered ralph rose from his
seat and advanced a few steps to receive them and his stately figure
and dark countenance as he bent courteously toward his guests had a
natural dignity contrasting well with the bustling importance of the
squire the old gentleman according to invariable custom gave an
elaborate preliminary flourish with his cane in the air then removed
his three-cornered hat in order to wipe his brow and finally
proceeded to make known his errand

my colleagues and myself began the squire are burdened with
momentous duties being jointly selectmen of this village our minds
for the space of three days past have been laboriously bent on the
selection of a suitable person to fill a most important office and
take upon himself a charge and rule which wisely considered may be
ranked no lower than those of kings and potentates and whereas you
our native townsman are of good natural intellect and well cultivated
by foreign travel and that certain vagaries and fantasies of your
youth are doubtless long ago corrected taking all these matters i
say into due consideration we are of opinion that providence hath
sent you hither at this juncture for our very purpose

during this harangue cranfield gazed fixedly at the speaker as if he
beheld something mysterious and unearthly in his pompous little
figure and as if the squire had worn the flowing robes of an ancient
sage instead of a square-skirted coat flapped waistcoat velvet
breeches and silk stockings nor was his wonder without sufficient
cause for the flourish of the squire's staff marvellous to relate
had described precisely the signal in the air which was to ratify the
message of the prophetic sage whom cranfield had sought around the
world

and what inquired ralph cranfield with a tremor in his
voice what may this office be which is to equal me with kings and
potentates

no less than instructor of our village school answered squire
hawkwood the office being now vacant by the death of the venerable
master whitaker after a fifty years incumbency

i will consider of your proposal replied ralph cranfield
hurriedly and will make known my decision within three days

after a few more words the village dignitary and his companions took
their leave but to cranfield's fancy their images were still present
and became more and more invested with the dim awfulness of figures
which had first appeared to him in a dream and afterward had shown
themselves in his waking moments assuming homely aspects among
familiar things his mind dwelt upon the features of the squire till
they grew confused with those of the visionary sage and one appeared
but the shadow of the other the same visage he now thought had
looked forth upon him from the pyramid of cheops the same form had
beckoned to him among the colonnades of the alhambra the same figure
had mistily revealed itself through the ascending steam of the great
geyser at every effort of his memory he recognized some trait of the
dreamy messenger of destiny in this pompous bustling self-important
little-great man of the village amid such musings ralph cranfield sat
all day in the cottage scarcely hearing and vaguely answering his
mother's thousand questions about his travels and adventures at
sunset he roused himself to take a stroll and passing the aged elm
tree his eye was again caught by the semblance of a hand pointing
downward at the half-obliterated inscription

as cranfield walked down the street of the village the level sunbeams
threw his shadow far before him and he fancied that as his shadow
walked among distant objects so had there been a presentiment
stalking in advance of him throughout his life and when he drew near
each object over which his tall shadow had preceded him still it
proved to be one of the familiar recollections of his infancy and
youth every crook in the pathway was remembered even the more
transitory characteristics of the scene were the same as in by-gone
days a company of cows were grazing on the grassy roadside and
refreshed him with their fragrant breath it is sweeter thought he
than the perfume which was wafted to our ship from the spice
islands the round little figure of a child rolled from a doorway and
lay laughing almost beneath cranfield's feet the dark and stately man
stooped down and lifting the infant restored him to his mother's
arms the children said he to himself and sighed and smiled the
children are to be my charge and while a flow of natural feeling
gushed like a well-spring in his heart he came to a dwelling which he
could nowise forbear to enter a sweet voice which seemed to come from
a deep and tender soul was warbling a plaintive little air within he
bent his head and passed through the lowly door as his foot sounded
upon the threshold a young woman advanced from the dusky interior of
the house at first hastily and then with a more uncertain step till
they met face to face there was a singular contrast in their two
figures he dark and picturesque one who had battled with the world
whom all suns had shone upon and whom all winds had blown on a varied
course she neat comely and quiet quiet even in her agitation as if
all her emotions had been subdued to the peaceful tenor of her life
yet their faces all unlike as they were had an expression that
seemed not so alien a glow of kindred feeling flashing upward anew
from half-extinguished embers

you are welcome home said faith egerton

but cranfield did not immediately answer for his eye had been caught
by an ornament in the shape of a heart which faith wore as a brooch
upon her bosom the material was the ordinary white quartz and he
recollected having himself shaped it out of one of those indian
arrowheads which are so often found in the ancient haunts of the red
men it was precisely on the pattern of that worn by the visionary
maid when cranfield departed on his shadowy search he had bestowed
this brooch in a gold setting as a parting gift to faith egerton

so faith you have kept the heart said he at length

yes said she blushing deeply then more gayly and what else
have you brought me from beyond the sea

faith replied ralph cranfield uttering the fated words by an
uncontrollable impulse i have brought you nothing but a heavy heart
may i rest its weight on you

this token which i have worn so long said faith laying her
tremulous finger on the heart is the assurance that you may

faith faith cried cranfield clasping her in his arms you have
interpreted my wild and weary dream

yes the wild dreamer was awake at last to find the mysterious
treasure he was to till the earth around his mother's dwelling and
reap its products instead of warlike command or regal or religious
sway he was to rule over the village children and now the visionary
maid had faded from his fancy and in her place he saw the playmate of
his childhood

would all who cherish such wild wishes but look around them they
would oftenest find their sphere of duty of prosperity and happiness
within those precincts and in that station where providence itself has
cast their lot happy they who read the riddle without a weary
world-search or a lifetime spent in vain

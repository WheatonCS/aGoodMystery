busy and important an evening

alice revived under the renovating influence of the open air and
as her physical rather than her mental powers had been the subject of
weakness she stood in no need of any explanation of that which had
occurred

now let me make an effort to walk she said when they had entered the
forest blushing though unseen that she had not been sooner able to
quit the arms of duncan i am indeed restored

nay alice you are yet too weak

the maiden struggled gently to release herself and heyward was
compelled to part with his precious burden the representative of the
bear had certainly been an entire stranger to the delicious emotions of
the lover while his arms encircled his mistress and he was perhaps
a stranger also to the nature of that feeling of ingenuous shame that
oppressed the trembling alice but when he found himself at a suitable
distance from the lodges he made a halt and spoke on a subject of which
he was thoroughly the master

this path will lead you to the brook he said follow its northern
bank until you come to a fall mount the hill on your right and you
will see the fires of the other people there you must go and demand
protection if they are true delawares you will be safe a distant
flight with that gentle one just now is impossible the hurons would
follow up our trail and master our scalps before we had got a dozen
miles go and providence be with you

and you demanded heyward in surprise surely we part not here

the hurons hold the pride of the delawares the last of the high blood
of the mohicans is in their power returned the scout i go to see
what can be done in his favor had they mastered your scalp major a
knave should have fallen for every hair it held as i promised but if
the young sagamore is to be led to the stake the indians shall see also
how a man without a cross can die

not in the least offended with the decided preference that the sturdy
woodsman gave to one who might in some degree be called the child of
his adoption duncan still continued to urge such reasons against so
desperate an effort as presented themselves he was aided by alice who
mingled her entreaties with those of heyward that he would abandon a
resolution that promised so much danger with so little hope of success
their eloquence and ingenuity were expended in vain the scout heard
them attentively but impatiently and finally closed the discussion
by answering in a tone that instantly silenced alice while it told
heyward how fruitless any further remonstrances would be

i have heard he said that there is a feeling in youth which binds
man to woman closer than the father is tied to the son it may be so
i have seldom been where women of my color dwell but such may be the
gifts of nature in the settlements you have risked life and all that
is dear to you to bring off this gentle one and i suppose that some
such disposition is at the bottom of it all as for me i taught the lad
the real character of a rifle and well has he paid me for it i have
fou't at his side in many a bloody scrimmage and so long as i could
hear the crack of his piece in one ear and that of the sagamore in the
other i knew no enemy was on my back winters and summer nights and
days have we roved the wilderness in company eating of the same dish
one sleeping while the other watched and afore it shall be said that
uncas was taken to the torment and i at hand there is but a single
ruler of us all whatever may the color of the skin and him i call
to witness that before the mohican boy shall perish for the want of
a friend good faith shall depart the arth and killdeer become as
harmless as the tooting we'pon of the singer

duncan released his hold on the arm of the scout who turned and
steadily retraced his steps toward the lodges after pausing a moment to
gaze at his retiring form the successful and yet sorrowful heyward
and alice took their way together toward the distant village of the
delawares




chapter 

 bot let me play the lion too
 midsummer night's dream

notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all
the difficulties and danger he was about to incur in his return to
the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in
devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part
of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
nothing but the color of his skin had saved the lives of magua and the
conjurer who would have been the first victims sacrificed to his own
security had not the scout believed such an act however congenial it
might be to the nature of an indian utterly unworthy of one who boasted
a descent from men that knew no cross of blood accordingly he trusted
to the withes and ligaments with which he had bound his captives
and pursued his way directly toward the center of the lodges as he
approached the buildings his steps become more deliberate and his
vigilant eye suffered no sign whether friendly or hostile to escape
him a neglected hut was a little in advance of the others and appeared
as if it had been deserted when half completed most probably on account
of failing in some of the more important requisites such as wood
or water a faint light glimmered through its cracks however and
announced that notwithstanding its imperfect structure it was not
without a tenant thither then the scout proceeded like a prudent
general who was about to feel the advanced positions of his enemy
before he hazarded the main attack

throwing himself into a suitable posture for the beast he represented
hawkeye crawled to a little opening where he might command a view of
the interior it proved to be the abiding place of david gamut hither
the faithful singing-master had now brought himself together with
all his sorrows his apprehensions and his meek dependence on the
protection of providence at the precise moment when his ungainly person
came under the observation of the scout in the manner just mentioned
the woodsman himself though in his assumed character was the subject
of the solitary being's profounded reflections

however implicit the faith of david was in the performance of ancient
miracles he eschewed the belief of any direct supernatural agency in
the management of modern morality in other words while he had implicit
faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak he was somewhat skeptical
on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of
the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs there was
something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter
confusion of the state of his mind he was seated on a pile of brush
a few twigs from which occasionally fed his low fire with his head
leaning on his arm in a posture of melancholy musing the costume
of the votary of music had undergone no other alteration from that so
lately described except that he had covered his bald head with the
triangular beaver which had not proved sufficiently alluring to excite
the cupidity of any of his captors

the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other
had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without
his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
first making the circuit of the hut and ascertaining that it stood
quite alone and that the character of its inmate was likely to protect
it from visitors he ventured through its low door into the very
presence of gamut the position of the latter brought the fire between
them and when hawkeye had seated himself on end near a minute elapsed
during which the two remained regarding each other without speaking
the suddenness and the nature of the surprise had nearly proved too much
for we will not say the philosophy but for the pitch and resolution
of david he fumbled for his pitch-pipe and arose with a confused
intention of attempting a musical exorcism

dark and mysterious monster he exclaimed while with trembling hands
he disposed of his auxiliary eyes and sought his never-failing resource
in trouble the gifted version of the psalms i know not your nature
nor intents but if aught you meditate against the person and rights
of one of the humblest servants of the temple listen to the inspired
language of the youth of israel and repent

the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well-known voice replied

put up the tooting we'pon and teach your throat modesty five words
of plain and comprehendible english are worth just now an hour of
squalling

what art thou demanded david utterly disqualified to pursue his
original intention and nearly gasping for breath

a man like yourself and one whose blood is as little tainted by the
cross of a bear or an indian as your own have you so soon forgotten
from whom you received the foolish instrument you hold in your hand

can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the
truth began to dawn upon him i have found many marvels during my
sojourn with the heathen but surely nothing to excel this

come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the
better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see
a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no
tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not
bestowed now let us to business

first tell me of the maiden and of the youth who so bravely sought
her interrupted david

ay they are happily freed from the tomahawks of these varlets but can
you put me on the scent of uncas

the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed i
greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and
i have sought a goodly hymn 

can you lead me to him

the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though
i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his
unhappy fortunes

no more words but lead on returned hawkeye concealing his face
again and setting the example in his own person by instantly quitting
the lodge

as they proceeded the scout ascertained that his companion found access
to uncas under privilege of his imaginary infirmity aided by the favor
he had acquired with one of the guards who in consequence of speaking
a little english had been selected by david as the subject of a
religious conversion how far the huron comprehended the intentions of
his new friend may well be doubted but as exclusive attention is
as flattering to a savage as to a more civilized individual it had
produced the effect we have mentioned it is unnecessary to repeat the
shrewd manner with which the scout extracted these particulars from the
simple david neither shall we dwell in this place on the nature of the
instruction he delivered when completely master of all the necessary
facts as the whole will be sufficiently explained to the reader in the
course of the narrative

the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the
village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to
approach or leave without observation but it was not the policy of
hawkeye to affect the least concealment presuming on his disguise and
his ability to sustain the character he had assumed he took the most
plain and direct route to the place the hour however afforded him
some little of that protection which he appeared so much to despise the
boys were already buried in sleep and all the women and most of the
warriors had retired to their lodges for the night four or five of
the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but
close observers of the manner of their captive

at the sight of gamut accompanied by one in the well-known masquerade
of their most distinguished conjurer they readily made way for them
both still they betrayed no intention to depart on the other hand
they were evidently disposed to remain bound to the place by an
additional interest in the mysterious mummeries that they of course
expected from such a visit

from the total inability of the scout to address the hurons in their own
language he was compelled to trust the conversation entirely to david
notwithstanding the simplicity of the latter he did ample justice to
the instructions he had received more than fulfilling the strongest
hopes of his teacher

the delawares are women he exclaimed addressing himself to the
savage who had a slight understanding of the language in which he spoke
the yengeese my foolish countrymen have told them to take up the
tomahawk and strike their fathers in the canadas and they have
forgotten their sex does my brother wish to hear le cerf agile ask
for his petticoats and see him weep before the hurons at the stake

the exclamation hugh delivered in a strong tone of assent announced
the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an
exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared

then let him step aside and the cunning man will blow upon the dog
tell it to my brothers

the huron explained the meaning of david to his fellows who in their
turn listened to the project with that sort of satisfaction that
their untamed spirits might be expected to find in such a refinement in
cruelty they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the
supposed conjurer to enter but the bear instead of obeying maintained
the seat it had taken and growled

the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers
and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he
received they must stand further off

the hurons who would have deemed such a misfortune the heaviest
calamity that could befall them fell back in a body taking a position
where they were out of earshot though at the same time they could
command a view of the entrance to the lodge then as if satisfied of
their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and
lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the
purposed of cookery

uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly
bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withes when the
frightful object first presented itself to the young mohican he did not
deign to bestow a single glance on the animal the scout who had left
david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it
prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy instead
of speaking therefore he exerted himself to enact one of the antics of
the animal he represented the young mohican who at first believed his
enemies had sent in a real beast to torment him and try his nerves
detected in those performances that to heyward had appeared so accurate
certain blemishes that at once betrayed the counterfeit had hawkeye
been aware of the low estimation in which the skillful uncas held his
representations he would probably have prolonged the entertainment
a little in pique but the scornful expression of the young man's eye
admitted of so many constructions that the worthy scout was spared the
mortification of such a discovery as soon therefore as david gave the
preconcerted signal a low hissing sound was heard in the lodge in place
of the fierce growlings of the bear

uncas had cast his body back against the wall of the hut and closed
his eyes as if willing to exclude so contemptible and disagreeable
an object from his sight but the moment the noise of the serpent was
heard he arose and cast his looks on each side of him bending his
head low and turning it inquiringly in every direction until his keen
eye rested on the shaggy monster where it remained riveted as though
fixed by the power of a charm again the same sounds were repeated
evidently proceeding from the mouth of the beast once more the eyes of
the youth roamed over the interior of the lodge and returning to the
former resting place he uttered in a deep suppressed voice

hawkeye

cut his bands said hawkeye to david who just then approached them

the singer did as he was ordered and uncas found his limbs released at
the same moment the dried skin of the animal rattled and presently
the scout arose to his feet in proper person the mohican appeared to
comprehend the nature of the attempt his friend had made intuitively
neither tongue nor feature betraying another symptom of surprise when
hawkeye had cast his shaggy vestment which was done by simply loosing
certain thongs of skin he drew a long glittering knife and put it in
the hands of uncas

the red hurons are without he said let us be ready at the same
time he laid his finger significantly on another similar weapon both
being the fruits of his prowess among their enemies during the evening

we will go said uncas

whither

to the tortoises they are the children of my grandfathers

ay lad said the scout in english a language he was apt to use
when a little abstracted in mind the same blood runs in your veins
i believe but time and distance has a little changed its color what
shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and this
singer is as good as nothing

the hurons are boasters said uncas scornfully their totem is
a moose and they run like snails the delawares are children of the
tortoise and they outstrip the deer

ay lad there is truth in what you say and i doubt not on a rush
you would pass the whole nation and in a straight race of two miles
would be in and get your breath again afore a knave of them all was
within hearing of the other village but the gift of a white man lies
more in his arms than in his legs as for myself i can brain a huron as
well as a better man but when it comes to a race the knaves would prove
too much for me

uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the
way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the
lodge but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts
to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his
companion

after all he said it is unreasonable to keep one man in bondage to
the gifts of another so uncas you had better take the lead while i
will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed

the young mohican made no reply but quietly folded his arms and leaned
his body against one of the upright posts that supported the wall of the
hut

well said the scout looking up at him why do you tarry there will
be time enough for me as the knaves will give chase to you at first

uncas will stay was the calm reply

for what

to fight with his father's brother and die with the friend of the
delawares

ay lad returned hawkeye squeezing the hand of uncas between his own
iron fingers twould have been more like a mingo than a mohican had
you left me but i thought i would make the offer seeing that youth
commonly loves life well what can't be done by main courage in war
must be done by circumvention put on the skin i doubt not you can play
the bear nearly as well as myself

whatever might have been the private opinion of uncas of their
respective abilities in this particular his grave countenance
manifested no opinion of his superiority he silently and expeditiously
encased himself in the covering of the beast and then awaited such
other movements as his more aged companion saw fit to dictate

now friend said hawkeye addressing david an exchange of garments
will be a great convenience to you inasmuch as you are but little
accustomed to the make-shifts of the wilderness here take my hunting
shirt and cap and give me your blanket and hat you must trust me with
the book and spectacles as well as the tooter too if we ever meet
again in better times you shall have all back again with many thanks
into the bargain

david parted with the several articles named with a readiness that would
have done great credit to his liberality had he not certainly profited
in many particulars by the exchange hawkeye was not long in assuming
his borrowed garments and when his restless eyes were hid behind the
glasses and his head was surmounted by the triangular beaver as their
statures were not dissimilar he might readily have passed for the
singer by starlight as soon as these dispositions were made the scout
turned to david and gave him his parting instructions

are you much given to cowardice he bluntly asked by way of obtaining
a suitable understanding of the whole case before he ventured a
prescription

my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly
given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct
an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have
ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits

your chiefest danger will be at the moment when the savages find out
that they have been deceived if you are not then knocked on the head
your being a non-composser will protect you and you'll then have a good
reason to expect to die in your bed if you stay it must be to sit down
here in the shadow and take the part of uncas until such times as the
cunning of the indians discover the cheat when as i have already said
your times of trial will come so choose for yourself to make a rush or
tarry here

even so said david firmly i will abide in the place of the
delaware bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this
and more will i dare in his service

you have spoken as a man and like one who under wiser schooling
would have been brought to better things hold your head down and
draw in your legs their formation might tell the truth too early keep
silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to
break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind
the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not
depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as
becomes true warriors and trusty friends

hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about
to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught
not the damnable principle of revenge should i fall therefore seek
no victims to my manes but rather forgive my destroyers and if you
remember them at all let it be in prayers for the enlightening of their
minds and for their eternal welfare

the scout hesitated and appeared to muse

there is a principle in that he said different from the law of the
woods and yet it is fair and noble to reflect upon then heaving
a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a
condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish
to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not
always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
god bless you friend i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong
when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the
eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of
temptation

so saying the scout returned and shook david cordially by the hand
after which act of friendship he immediately left the lodge attended by
the new representative of the beast

the instant hawkeye found himself under the observation of the hurons
he drew up his tall form in the rigid manner of david threw out his
arm in the act of keeping time and commenced what he intended for an
imitation of his psalmody happily for the success of this delicate
adventure he had to deal with ears but little practised in the concord
of sweet sounds or the miserable effort would infallibly have been
detected it was necessary to pass within a dangerous proximity of the
dark group of the savages and the voice of the scout grew louder as
they drew nigher when at the nearest point the huron who spoke the
english thrust out an arm and stopped the supposed singing-master

the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through
the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he
afraid will the hurons hear his groans

a growl so exceedingly fierce and natural proceeded from the beast
that the young indian released his hold and started aside as if to
assure himself that it was not a veritable bear and no counterfeit
that was rolling before him hawkeye who feared his voice would betray
him to his subtle enemies gladly profited by the interruption to break
out anew in such a burst of musical expression as would probably in
a more refined state of society have been termed a grand crash among
his actual auditors however it merely gave him an additional claim to
that respect which they never withhold from such as are believed to be
the subjects of mental alienation the little knot of indians drew back
in a body and suffered as they thought the conjurer and his inspired
assistant to proceed

it required no common exercise of fortitude in uncas and the scout to
continue the dignified and deliberate pace they had assumed in passing
the lodge especially as they immediately perceived that curiosity had
so far mastered fear as to induce the watchers to approach the hut in
order to witness the effect of the incantations the least injudicious
or impatient movement on the part of david might betray them and time
was absolutely necessary to insure the safety of the scout the loud
noise the latter conceived it politic to continue drew many curious
gazers to the doors of the different huts as thy passed and once or
twice a dark-looking warrior stepped across their path led to the act
by superstition and watchfulness they were not however interrupted
the darkness of the hour and the boldness of the attempt proving their
principal friends

the adventurers had got clear of the village and were now swiftly
approaching the shelter of the woods when a loud and long cry arose
from the lodge where uncas had been confined the mohican started on
his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he
counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort

hold said the scout grasping his friend by the shoulder let them
yell again twas nothing but wonderment

he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries
filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
hawkeye tapped him lightly on the shoulder and glided ahead

now let the devils strike our scent said the scout tearing two
rifles with all their attendant accouterments from beneath a bush and
flourishing killdeer as he handed uncas his weapon two at least
will find it to their deaths

then throwing their pieces to a low trail like sportsmen in readiness
for their game they dashed forward and were soon buried in the somber
darkness of the forest




chapter 

 ant i shall remember when c'sar says
 do this it is performed
 julius caesar

the impatience of the savages who lingered about the prison of uncas as
has been seen had overcome their dread of the conjurer's breath they
stole cautiously and with beating hearts to a crevice through which
the faint light of the fire was glimmering for several minutes they
mistook the form of david for that of the prisoner but the very
accident which hawkeye had foreseen occurred tired of keeping the
extremities of his long person so near together the singer gradually
suffered the lower limbs to extend themselves until one of his
misshapen feet actually came in contact with and shoved aside the embers
of the fire at first the hurons believed the delaware had been thus
deformed by witchcraft but when david unconscious of being observed
turned his head and exposed his simple mild countenance in place of
the haughty lineaments of their prisoner it would have exceeded the
credulity of even a native to have doubted any longer they rushed
together into the lodge and laying their hands with but little
ceremony on their captive immediately detected the imposition then
arose the cry first heard by the fugitives it was succeeded by the most
frantic and angry demonstrations of vengeance david however firm in
his determination to cover the retreat of his friends was compelled to
believe that his own final hour had come deprived of his book and his
pipe he was fain to trust to a memory that rarely failed him on such
subjects and breaking forth in a loud and impassioned strain he
endeavored to smooth his passage into the other world by singing the
opening verse of a funeral anthem the indians were seasonably reminded
of his infirmity and rushing into the open air they aroused the
village in the manner described

a native warrior fights as he sleeps without the protection of anything
defensive the sounds of the alarm were therefore hardly uttered
before two hundred men were afoot and ready for the battle or the
chase as either might be required the escape was soon known and the
whole tribe crowded in a body around the council-lodge impatiently
awaiting the instruction of their chiefs in such a sudden demand on
their wisdom the presence of the cunning magua could scarcely fail of
being needed his name was mentioned and all looked round in wonder
that he did not appear messengers were then despatched to his lodge
requiring his presence

in the meantime some of the swiftest and most discreet of the young
men were ordered to make the circuit of the clearing under cover of
the woods in order to ascertain that their suspected neighbors the
delawares designed no mischief women and children ran to and fro
and in short the whole encampment exhibited another scene of wild
and savage confusion gradually however these symptoms of disorder
diminished and in a few minutes the oldest and most distinguished
chiefs were assembled in the lodge in grave consultation

the clamor of many voices soon announced that a party approached who
might be expected to communicate some intelligence that would explain
the mystery of the novel surprise the crowd without gave way and
several warriors entered the place bringing with them the hapless
conjurer who had been left so long by the scout in duress

notwithstanding this man was held in very unequal estimation among the
hurons some believing implicitly in his power and others deeming him
an impostor he was now listened to by all with the deepest attention
when his brief story was ended the father of the sick woman stepped
forth and in a few pithy expression related in his turn what he
knew these two narratives gave a proper direction to the subsequent
inquiries which were now made with the characteristic cunning of
savages

instead of rushing in a confused and disorderly throng to the cavern
ten of the wisest and firmest among the chiefs were selected to
prosecute the investigation as no time was to be lost the instant the
choice was made the individuals appointed rose in a body and left the
place without speaking on reaching the entrance the younger men in
advance made way for their seniors and the whole proceeded along
the low dark gallery with the firmness of warriors ready to devote
themselves to the public good though at the same time secretly
doubting the nature of the power with which they were about to contend

the outer apartment of the cavern was silent and gloomy the woman lay
in her usual place and posture though there were those present who
affirmed they had seen her borne to the woods by the supposed medicine
of the white men such a direct and palpable contradiction of the tale
related by the father caused all eyes to be turned on him chafed by
the silent imputation and inwardly troubled by so unaccountable a
circumstance the chief advanced to the side of the bed and stooping
cast an incredulous look at the features as if distrusting their
reality his daughter was dead

the unerring feeling of nature for a moment prevailed and the old
warrior hid his eyes in sorrow then recovering his self-possession he
faced his companions and pointing toward the corpse he said in the
language of his people

the wife of my young man has left us the great spirit is angry with
his children

the mournful intelligence was received in solemn silence after a short
pause one of the elder indians was about to speak when a dark-looking
object was seen rolling out of an adjoining apartment into the very
center of the room where they stood ignorant of the nature of the
beings they had to deal with the whole party drew back a little and
rising on end exhibited the distorted but still fierce and sullen
features of magua the discovery was succeeded by a general exclamation
of amazement

as soon however as the true situation of the chief was understood
several knives appeared and his limbs and tongue were quickly released
the huron arose and shook himself like a lion quitting his lair not a
word escaped him though his hand played convulsively with the handle of
his knife while his lowering eyes scanned the whole party as if they
sought an object suited to the first burst of his vengeance

it was happy for uncas and the scout and even david that they were
all beyond the reach of his arm at such a moment for assuredly
no refinement in cruelty would then have deferred their deaths in
opposition to the promptings of the fierce temper that nearly choked
him meeting everywhere faces that he knew as friends the savage grated
his teeth together like rasps of iron and swallowed his passion for
want of a victim on whom to vent it this exhibition of anger was noted
by all present and from an apprehension of exasperating a temper that
was already chafed nearly to madness several minutes were suffered to
pass before another word was uttered when however suitable time had
elapsed the oldest of the party spoke

my friend has found an enemy he said is he nigh that the hurons
might take revenge

let the delaware die exclaimed magua in a voice of thunder

another longer and expressive silence was observed and was broken as
before with due precaution by the same individual

the mohican is swift of foot and leaps far he said but my young
men are on his trail

is he gone demanded magua in tones so deep and guttural that they
seemed to proceed from his inmost chest

an evil spirit has been among us and the delaware has blinded our
eyes

an evil spirit repeated the other mockingly tis the spirit that
has taken the lives of so many hurons the spirit that slew my young men
at the tumbling river that took their scalps at the healing spring
and who has now bound the arms of le renard subtil

of whom does my friend speak

of the dog who carries the heart and cunning of a huron under a pale
skin la longue carabine

the pronunciation of so terrible a name produced the usual effect among
his auditors but when time was given for reflection and the warriors
remembered that their formidable and daring enemy had even been in the
bosom of their encampment working injury fearful rage took the place
of wonder and all those fierce passions with which the bosom of magua
had just been struggling were suddenly transferred to his companions
some among them gnashed their teeth in anger others vented their
feelings in yells and some again beat the air as frantically as if
the object of their resentment were suffering under their blows but
this sudden outbreaking of temper as quickly subsided in the still and
sullen restraint they most affected in their moments of inaction

magua who had in his turn found leisure for reflection now changed his
manner and assumed the air of one who knew how to think and act with a
dignity worthy of so grave a subject

let us go to my people he said they wait for us

his companions consented in silence and the whole of the savage party
left the cavern and returned to the council-lodge when they were
seated all eyes turned on magua who understood from such an
indication that by common consent they had devolved the duty of
relating what had passed on him he arose and told his tale without
duplicity or reservation the whole deception practised by both duncan
and hawkeye was of course laid naked and no room was found even for
the most superstitious of the tribe any longer to affix a doubt on the
character of the occurrences it was but too apparent that they had been
insultingly shamefully disgracefully deceived when he had ended and
resumed his seat the collected tribe for his auditors in substance
included all the fighting men of the party sat regarding each other
like men astonished equally at the audacity and the success of
their enemies the next consideration however was the means and
opportunities for revenge

additional pursuers were sent on the trail of the fugitives and
then the chiefs applied themselves in earnest to the business of
consultation many different expedients were proposed by the elder
warriors in succession to all of which magua was a silent and
respectful listener that subtle savage had recovered his artifice and
self-command and now proceeded toward his object with his customary
caution and skill it was only when each one disposed to speak had
uttered his sentiments that he prepared to advance his own opinions
they were given with additional weight from the circumstance that some
of the runners had already returned and reported that their enemies had
been traced so far as to leave no doubt of their having sought safety in
the neighboring camp of their suspected allies the delawares with the
advantage of possessing this important intelligence the chief warily
laid his plans before his fellows and as might have been anticipated
from his eloquence and cunning they were adopted without a dissenting
voice they were briefly as follows both in opinions and in motives

it has been already stated that in obedience to a policy rarely
departed from the sisters were separated so soon as they reached the
huron village magua had early discovered that in retaining the person
of alice he possessed the most effectual check on cora when they
parted therefore he kept the former within reach of his hand
consigning the one he most valued to the keeping of their allies the
arrangement was understood to be merely temporary and was made as much
with a view to flatter his neighbors as in obedience to the invariable
rule of indian policy

while goaded incessantly by these revengeful impulses that in a savage
seldom slumber the chief was still attentive to his more permanent
personal interests the follies and disloyalty committed in his youth
were to be expiated by a long and painful penance ere he could be
restored to the full enjoyment of the confidence of his ancient people
and without confidence there could be no authority in an indian tribe
in this delicate and arduous situation the crafty native had neglected
no means of increasing his influence and one of the happiest of his
expedients had been the success with which he had cultivated the favor
of their powerful and dangerous neighbors the result of his experiment
had answered all the expectations of his policy for the hurons were in
no degree exempt from that governing principle of nature which induces
man to value his gifts precisely in the degree that they are appreciated
by others

but while he was making this ostensible sacrifice to general
considerations magua never lost sight of his individual motives the
latter had been frustrated by the unlooked-for events which had placed
all his prisoners beyond his control and he now found himself reduced
to the necessity of suing for favors to those whom it had so lately been
his policy to oblige

several of the chiefs had proposed deep and treacherous schemes to
surprise the delawares and by gaining possession of their camp to
recover their prisoners by the same blow for all agreed that their
honor their interests and the peace and happiness of their dead
countrymen imperiously required them speedily to immolate some victims
to their revenge but plans so dangerous to attempt and of such
doubtful issue magua found little difficulty in defeating he exposed
their risk and fallacy with his usual skill and it was only after he
had removed every impediment in the shape of opposing advice that he
ventured to propose his own projects

he commenced by flattering the self-love of his auditors a
never-failing method of commanding attention when he had enumerated the
many different occasions on which the hurons had exhibited their courage
and prowess in the punishment of insults he digressed in a high
encomium on the virtue of wisdom he painted the quality as forming the
great point of difference between the beaver and other brutes between
the brutes and men and finally between the hurons in particular
and the rest of the human race after he had sufficiently extolled the
property of discretion he undertook to exhibit in what manner its use
was applicable to the present situation of their tribe on the one hand
he said was their great pale father the governor of the canadas who
had looked upon his children with a hard eye since their tomahawks had
been so red on the other a people as numerous as themselves who spoke
a different language possessed different interests and loved them not
and who would be glad of any pretense to bring them in disgrace with the
great white chief then he spoke of their necessities of the gifts they
had a right to expect for their past services of their distance from
their proper hunting-grounds and native villages and of the necessity
of consulting prudence more and inclination less in so critical
circumstances when he perceived that while the old men applauded his
moderation many of the fiercest and most distinguished of the warriors
listened to these politic plans with lowering looks he cunningly led
them back to the subject which they most loved he spoke openly of the
fruits of their wisdom which he boldly pronounced would be a complete
and final triumph over their enemies he even darkly hinted that their
success might be extended with proper caution in such a manner as to
include the destruction of all whom they had reason to hate in short
he so blended the warlike with the artful the obvious with the obscure
as to flatter the propensities of both parties and to leave to each
subject of hope while neither could say it clearly comprehended his
intentions

the orator or the politician who can produce such a state of things
is commonly popular with his contemporaries however he may be treated
by posterity all perceived that more was meant than was uttered and
each one believed that the hidden meaning was precisely such as his
own faculties enabled him to understand or his own wishes led him to
anticipate

in this happy state of things it is not surprising that the management
of magua prevailed the tribe consented to act with deliberation and
with one voice they committed the direction of the whole affair to the
government of the chief who had suggested such wise and intelligible
expedients

magua had now attained one great object of all his cunning and
enterprise the ground he had lost in the favor of his people was
completely regained and he found himself even placed at the head
of affairs he was in truth their ruler and so long as he could
maintain his popularity no monarch could be more despotic especially
while the tribe continued in a hostile country throwing off therefore
the appearance of consultation he assumed the grave air of authority
necessary to support the dignity of his office

runners were despatched for intelligence in different directions spies
were ordered to approach and feel the encampment of the delawares the
warriors were dismissed to their lodges with an intimation that their
services would soon be needed and the women and children were ordered
to retire with a warning that it was their province to be silent when
these several arrangements were made magua passed through the village
stopping here and there to pay a visit where he thought his presence
might be flattering to the individual he confirmed his friends in their
confidence fixed the wavering and gratified all then he sought his
own lodge the wife the huron chief had abandoned when he was chased
from among his people was dead children he had none and he now
occupied a hut without companion of any sort it was in fact the
dilapidated and solitary structure in which david had been discovered
and whom he had tolerated in his presence on those few occasions when
they met with the contemptuous indifference of a haughty superiority

hither then magua retired when his labors of policy were ended while
others slept however he neither knew or sought repose had there been
one sufficiently curious to have watched the movements of the newly
elected chief he would have seen him seated in a corner of his
lodge musing on the subject of his future plans from the hour of his
retirement to the time he had appointed for the warriors to assemble
again occasionally the air breathed through the crevices of the hut
and the low flame that fluttered about the embers of the fire threw
their wavering light on the person of the sullen recluse at such
moments it would not have been difficult to have fancied the dusky
savage the prince of darkness brooding on his own fancied wrongs and
plotting evil

long before the day dawned however warrior after warrior entered the
solitary hut of magua until they had collected to the number of twenty
each bore his rifle and all the other accouterments of war though
the paint was uniformly peaceful the entrance of these fierce-looking
beings was unnoticed some seating themselves in the shadows of the
place and others standing like motionless statues until the whole of
the designated band was collected

then magua arose and gave the signal to proceed marching himself in
advance they followed their leader singly and in that well-known order
which has obtained the distinguishing appellation of indian file
unlike other men engaged in the spirit-stirring business of war they
stole from their camp unostentatiously and unobserved resembling a band
of gliding specters more than warriors seeking the bubble reputation by
deeds of desperate daring

instead of taking the path which led directly toward the camp of the
delawares magua led his party for some distance down the windings of
the stream and along the little artificial lake of the beavers the
day began to dawn as they entered the clearing which had been formed by
those sagacious and industrious animals though magua who had resumed
his ancient garb bore the outline of a fox on the dressed skin which
formed his robe there was one chief of his party who carried the beaver
as his peculiar symbol or totem there would have been a species of
profanity in the omission had this man passed so powerful a community
of his fancied kindred without bestowing some evidence of his regard
accordingly he paused and spoke in words as kind and friendly as if
he were addressing more intelligent beings he called the animals his
cousins and reminded them that his protecting influence was the reason
they remained unharmed while many avaricious traders were prompting the
indians to take their lives he promised a continuance of his favors
and admonished them to be grateful after which he spoke of the
expedition in which he was himself engaged and intimated though with
sufficient delicacy and circumlocution the expediency of bestowing
on their relative a portion of that wisdom for which they were so
renowned

 these harangues of the beasts were frequent among the
 indians they often address their victims in this way
 reproaching them for cowardice or commending their
 resolution as they may happen to exhibit fortitude or the
 reverse in suffering

during the utterance of this extraordinary address the companions of
the speaker were as grave and as attentive to his language as though
they were all equally impressed with its propriety once or twice black
objects were seen rising to the surface of the water and the huron
expressed pleasure conceiving that his words were not bestowed in vain
just as he ended his address the head of a large beaver was thrust
from the door of a lodge whose earthen walls had been much injured
and which the party had believed from its situation to be uninhabited
such an extraordinary sign of confidence was received by the orator as
a highly favorable omen and though the animal retreated a little
precipitately he was lavish of his thanks and commendations

when magua thought sufficient time had been lost in gratifying the
family affection of the warrior he again made the signal to proceed as
the indians moved away in a body and with a step that would have been
inaudible to the ears of any common man the same venerable-looking
beaver once more ventured his head from its cover had any of the hurons
turned to look behind them they would have seen the animal watching
their movements with an interest and sagacity that might easily have
been mistaken for reason indeed so very distinct and intelligible were
the devices of the quadruped that even the most experienced observer
would have been at a loss to account for its actions until the moment
when the party entered the forest when the whole would have been
explained by seeing the entire animal issue from the lodge uncasing
by the act the grave features of chingachgook from his mask of fur




chapter 

 brief i pray for you for you see tis a busy time with me
 much ado about nothing

the tribe or rather half tribe of delawares which has been so
often mentioned and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the
temporary village of the hurons could assemble about an equal number of
warriors with the latter people like their neighbors they had followed
montcalm into the territories of the english crown and were making
heavy and serious inroads on the hunting-grounds of the mohawks though
they had seen fit with the mysterious reserve so common among the
natives to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most
required the french had accounted for this unexpected defection on
the part of their ally in various ways it was the prevalent opinion
however that they had been influenced by veneration for the ancient
treaty that had once made them dependent on the six nations for
military protection and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their
former masters as for the tribe itself it had been content to announce
to montcalm through his emissaries with indian brevity that their
hatchets were dull and time was necessary to sharpen them the politic
captain of the canadas had deemed it wiser to submit to entertain a
passive friend than by any acts of ill-judged severity to convert him
into an open enemy

on that morning when magua led his silent party from the settlement of
the beavers into the forests in the manner described the sun rose upon
the delaware encampment as if it had suddenly burst upon a busy people
actively employed in all the customary avocations of high noon the
women ran from lodge to lodge some engaged in preparing their morning's
meal a few earnestly bent on seeking the comforts necessary to their
habits but more pausing to exchange hasty and whispered sentences with
their friends the warriors were lounging in groups musing more than
they conversed and when a few words were uttered speaking like men who
deeply weighed their opinions the instruments of the chase were to be
seen in abundance among the lodges but none departed here and there
a warrior was examining his arms with an attention that is rarely
bestowed on the implements when no other enemy than the beasts of the
forest is expected to be encountered and occasionally the eyes of a
whole group were turned simultaneously toward a large and silent lodge
in the center of the village as if it contained the subject of their
common thoughts

during the existence of this scene a man suddenly appeared at the
furthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the
village he was without arms and his paint tended rather to soften than
increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance when in
full view of the delawares he stopped and made a gesture of amity
by throwing his arm upward toward heaven and then letting it fall
impressively on his breast the inhabitants of the village answered
his salute by a low murmur of welcome and encouraged him to advance by
similar indications of friendship fortified by these assurances the
dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace where it had
stood a moment drawn in a strong outline against the blushing morning
sky and moved with dignity into the very center of the huts as he
approached nothing was audible but the rattling of the light silver
ornaments that loaded his arms and neck and the tinkling of the little
bells that fringed his deerskin moccasins he made as he advanced many
courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed neglecting to notice
the women however like one who deemed their favor in the present
enterprise of no importance when he had reached the group in which it
was evident by the haughtiness of their common mien that the principal
chiefs were collected the stranger paused and then the delawares saw
that the active and erect form that stood before them was that of the
well-known huron chief le renard subtil

his reception was grave silent and wary the warriors in front stepped
aside opening the way to their most approved orator by the action one
who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern
aborigines

the wise huron is welcome said the delaware in the language of the
maquas he is come to eat his succotash with his brothers of the
lakes

 a dish composed of cracked corn and beans it is much used
 also by the whites by corn is meant maise

he is come repeated magua bending his head with the dignity of an
eastern prince

the chief extended his arm and taking the other by the wrist they once
more exchanged friendly salutations then the delaware invited his guest
to enter his own lodge and share his morning meal the invitation was
accepted and the two warriors attended by three or four of the old
men walked calmly away leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a
desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit and yet not
betraying the least impatience by sign or word

during the short and frugal repast that followed the conversation was
extremely circumspect and related entirely to the events of the hunt
in which magua had so lately been engaged it would have been impossible
for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of
considering the visit as a thing of course than did his hosts
notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that
it must be connected with some secret object and that probably of
importance to themselves when the appetites of the whole were appeased
the squaws removed the trenchers and gourds and the two parties began
to prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits

is the face of my great canada father turned again toward his huron
children demanded the orator of the delawares

when was it ever otherwise returned magua he calls my people most
beloved

the delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false
and continued

the tomahawks of your young men have been very red

it is so but they are now bright and dull for the yengeese are dead
and the delawares are our neighbors

the other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand
and remained silent then magua as if recalled to such a recollection
by the allusion to the massacre demanded

does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers

she is welcome

the path between the hurons and the delawares is short and it is open
let her be sent to my squaws if she gives trouble to my brother

she is welcome returned the chief of the latter nation still more
emphatically

the baffled magua continued silent several minutes apparently
indifferent however to the repulse he had received in this his opening
effort to regain possession of cora

do my young men leave the delawares room on the mountains for their
hunts he at length continued

the lenape are rulers of their own hills returned the other a little
haughtily

it is well justice is the master of a red-skin why should they
brighten their tomahawks and sharpen their knives against each other
are not the pale faces thicker than the swallows in the season of
flowers

good exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time

magua waited a little to permit his words to soften the feelings of the
delawares before he added

have there not been strange moccasins in the woods have not my
brothers scented the feet of white men

let my canada father come returned the other evasively his
children are ready to see him

when the great chief comes it is to smoke with the indians in their
wigwams the hurons say too he is welcome but the yengeese have long
arms and legs that never tire my young men dreamed they had seen the
trail of the yengeese nigh the village of the delawares

they will not find the lenape asleep

it is well the warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy said
magua once more shifting his ground when he found himself unable to
penetrate the caution of his companion i have brought gifts to my
brother his nation would not go on the warpath because they did not
think it well but their friends have remembered where they lived

when he had thus announced his liberal intention the crafty chief
arose and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his
hosts they consisted principally of trinkets of little value plundered
from the slaughtered females of william henry in the division of
the baubles the cunning huron discovered no less art than in their
selection while he bestowed those of greater value on the two most
distinguished warriors one of whom was his host he seasoned his
offerings to their inferiors with such well-timed and apposite
compliments as left them no ground of complaint in short the whole
ceremony contained such a happy blending of the profitable with the
flattering that it was not difficult for the donor immediately to read
the effect of a generosity so aptly mingled with praise in the eyes of
those he addressed

this well-judged and politic stroke on the part of magua was not without
instantaneous results the delawares lost their gravity in a much more
cordial expression and the host in particular after contemplating
his own liberal share of the spoil for some moments with peculiar
gratification repeated with strong emphasis the words

my brother is a wise chief he is welcome

the hurons love their friends the delawares returned magua why
should they not they are colored by the same sun and their just men
will hunt in the same grounds after death the red-skins should be
friends and look with open eyes on the white men has not my brother
scented spies in the woods

the delaware whose name in english signified hard heart an
appellation that the french had translated into le coeur-dur forgot
that obduracy of purpose which had probably obtained him so significant
a title his countenance grew very sensibly less stern and he now
deigned to answer more directly

there have been strange moccasins about my camp they have been tracked
into my lodges

did my brother beat out the dogs asked magua without adverting in
any manner to the former equivocation of the chief

it would not do the stranger is always welcome to the children of the
lenape

the stranger but not the spy

would the yengeese send their women as spies did not the huron chief
say he took women in the battle

he told no lie the yengeese have sent out their scouts they have been
in my wigwams but they found there no one to say welcome then they
fled to the delawares for say they the delawares are our friends
their minds are turned from their canada father

this insinuation was a home thrust and one that in a more advanced
state of society would have entitled magua to the reputation of a
skillful diplomatist the recent defection of the tribe had as they
well knew themselves subjected the delawares to much reproach among
their french allies and they were now made to feel that their future
actions were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust there was no
deep insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee that such
a situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their
future movements their distant villages their hunting-grounds and
hundreds of their women and children together with a material part
of their physical force were actually within the limits of the french
territory accordingly this alarming annunciation was received as
magua intended with manifest disapprobation if not with alarm

let my father look in my face said le coeur-dur he will see no
change it is true my young men did not go out on the war-path they
had dreams for not doing so but they love and venerate the great white
chief

will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the
camp of his children when he is told a bloody yengee smokes at your
fire that the pale face who has slain so many of his friends goes in
and out among the delawares go my great canada father is not a fool

where is the yengee that the delawares fear returned the other who
has slain my young men who is the mortal enemy of my great father

la longue carabine

the delaware warriors started at the well-known name betraying by their
amazement that they now learned for the first time one so famous
among the indian allies of france was within their power

what does my brother mean demanded le coeur-dur in a tone that by
its wonder far exceeded the usual apathy of his race

a huron never lies returned magua coldly leaning his head against
the side of the lodge and drawing his slight robe across his tawny
breast let the delawares count their prisoners they will find one
whose skin is neither red nor pale

a long and musing pause succeeded the chief consulted apart with his
companions and messengers despatched to collect certain others of the
most distinguished men of the tribe

as warrior after warrior dropped in they were each made acquainted in
turn with the important intelligence that magua had just communicated
the air of surprise and the usual low deep guttural exclamation were
common to them all the news spread from mouth to mouth until the whole
encampment became powerfully agitated the women suspended their
labors to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of
the consulting warriors the boys deserted their sports and walking
fearlessly among their fathers looked up in curious admiration as
they heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed the
temerity of their hated foe in short every occupation was abandoned
for the time and all other pursuits seemed discarded in order that the
tribe might freely indulge after their own peculiar manner in an open
expression of feeling

when the excitement had a little abated the old men disposed themselves
seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of
their tribe to perform under circumstances of so much delicacy and
embarrassment during all these movements and in the midst of the
general commotion magua had not only maintained his seat but the very
attitude he had originally taken against the side of the lodge where
he continued as immovable and apparently as unconcerned as if he
had no interest in the result not a single indication of the future
intentions of his hosts however escaped his vigilant eyes with his
consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with whom he had to
deal he anticipated every measure on which they decided and it might
almost be said that in many instances he knew their intentions even
before they became known to themselves

the council of the delawares was short when it was ended a general
bustle announced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and
formal assemblage of the nation as such meetings were rare and only
called on occasions of the last importance the subtle huron who still
sat apart a wily and dark observer of the proceedings now knew that
all his projects must be brought to their final issue he therefore
left the lodge and walked silently forth to the place in front of the
encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect

it might have been half an hour before each individual including even
the women and children was in his place the delay had been created
by the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and
unusual a conference but when the sun was seen climbing above the tops
of that mountain against whose bosom the delawares had constructed
their encampment most were seated and as his bright rays darted from
behind the outline of trees that fringed the eminence they fell upon
as grave as attentive and as deeply interested a multitude as was
probably ever before lighted by his morning beams its number somewhat
exceeded a thousand souls

in a collection of so serious savages there is never to be found any
impatient aspirant after premature distinction standing ready to move
his auditors to some hasty and perhaps injudicious discussion in
order that his own reputation may be the gainer an act of so much
precipitancy and presumption would seal the downfall of precocious
intellect forever it rested solely with the oldest and most experienced
of the men to lay the subject of the conference before the people until
such a one chose to make some movement no deeds in arms no natural
gifts nor any renown as an orator would have justified the slightest
interruption on the present occasion the aged warrior whose privilege
it was to speak was silent seemingly oppressed with the magnitude
of his subject the delay had already continued long beyond the usual
deliberative pause that always preceded a conference but no sign of
impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy occasionally an
eye was raised from the earth where the looks of most were riveted
and strayed toward a particular lodge that was however in no manner
distinguished from those around it except in the peculiar care that had
been taken to protect it against the assaults of the weather

at length one of those low murmurs that are so apt to disturb a
multitude was heard and the whole nation arose to their feet by
a common impulse at that instant the door of the lodge in question
opened and three men issuing from it slowly approached the place of
consultation they were all aged even beyond that period to which the
oldest present had reached but one in the center who leaned on his
companions for support had numbered an amount of years to which the
human race is seldom permitted to attain his frame which had once been
tall and erect like the cedar was now bending under the pressure of
more than a century the elastic light step of an indian was gone and
in its place he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground
inch by inch his dark wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild
contrast with the long white locks which floated on his shoulders in
such thickness as to announce that generations had probably passed away
since they had last been shorn

the dress of this patriarch for such considering his vast age in
conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people he might
very properly be termed was rich and imposing though strictly after
the simple fashions of the tribe his robe was of the finest
skins which had been deprived of their fur in order to admit of a
hieroglyphical representation of various deeds in arms done in former
ages his bosom was loaded with medals some in massive silver and one
or two even in gold the gifts of various christian potentates during
the long period of his life he also wore armlets and cinctures above
the ankles of the latter precious metal his head on the whole of
which the hair had been permitted to grow the pursuits of war having so
long been abandoned was encircled by a sort of plated diadem which in
its turn bore lesser and more glittering ornaments that sparkled amid
the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers dyed a deep black
in touching contrast to the color of his snow-white locks his tomahawk
was nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn
of solid gold

so soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure which the sudden
appearance of this venerated individual created had a little subsided
the name of tamenund was whispered from mouth to mouth magua had
often heard the fame of this wise and just delaware a reputation that
even proceeded so far as to bestow on him the rare gift of holding
secret communion with the great spirit and which has since transmitted
his name with some slight alteration to the white usurpers of his
ancient territory as the imaginary tutelar saint of a vast empire the
huron chief therefore stepped eagerly out a little from the throng
to a spot whence he might catch a nearer glimpse of the features of the
man whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his
own fortunes

 the americans sometimes called their tutelar saint
 tamenay a corruption of the name of the renowned chief here
 introduced there are many traditions which speak of the
 character and power of tamenund

the eyes of the old man were closed as though the organs were wearied
with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human
passions the color of his skin differed from that of most around him
being richer and darker the latter having been produced by certain
delicate and mazy lines of complicated and yet beautiful figures which
had been traced over most of his person by the operation of tattooing
notwithstanding the position of the huron he passed the observant and
silent magua without notice and leaning on his two venerable supporters
proceeded to the high place of the multitude where he seated himself in
the center of his nation with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a
father

nothing could surpass the reverence and affection with which this
unexpected visit from one who belongs rather to another world than to
this was received by his people after a suitable and decent pause the
principal chiefs arose and approaching the patriarch they placed
his hands reverently on their heads seeming to entreat a blessing the
younger men were content with touching his robe or even drawing nigh
his person in order to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged so
just and so valiant none but the most distinguished among the youthful
warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony the
great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness to look
upon a form so deeply venerated and so well beloved when these acts
of affection and respect were performed the chiefs drew back again to
their several places and silence reigned in the whole encampment

after a short delay a few of the young men to whom instructions had
been whispered by one of the aged attendants of tamenund arose left
the crowd and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the
object of so much attention throughout that morning in a few minutes
they reappeared escorting the individuals who had caused all these
solemn preparations toward the seat of judgment the crowd opened in a
lane and when the party had re-entered it closed in again forming a
large and dense belt of human bodies arranged in an open circle




chapter 

 the assembly seated rising o'er the rest
 achilles thus the king of men addressed
 pope's illiad

cora stood foremost among the prisoners entwining her arms in those of
alice in the tenderness of sisterly love notwithstanding the fearful
and menacing array of savages on every side of her no apprehension on
her own account could prevent the nobler-minded maiden from keeping her
eyes fastened on the pale and anxious features of the trembling alice
close at their side stood heyward with an interest in both that at
such a moment of intense uncertainty scarcely knew a preponderance in
favor of her whom he most loved hawkeye had placed himself a little in
the rear with a deference to the superior rank of his companions that
no similarity in the state of their present fortunes could induce him to
forget uncas was not there

when perfect silence was again restored and after the usual long
impressive pause one of the two aged chiefs who sat at the side of the
patriarch arose and demanded aloud in very intelligible english

which of my prisoners is la longue carabine

neither duncan nor the scout answered the former however glanced his
eyes around the dark and silent assembly and recoiled a pace when they
fell on the malignant visage of magua he saw at once that this wily
savage had some secret agency in their present arraignment before the
nation and determined to throw every possible impediment in the way of
the execution of his sinister plans he had witnessed one instance
of the summary punishments of the indians and now dreaded that his
companion was to be selected for a second in this dilemma with
little or no time for reflection he suddenly determined to cloak his
invaluable friend at any or every hazard to himself before he had
time however to speak the question was repeated in a louder voice
and with a clearer utterance

give us arms the young man haughtily replied and place us in yonder
woods our deeds shall speak for us

this is the warrior whose name has filled our ears returned the
chief regarding heyward with that sort of curious interest which seems
inseparable from man when first beholding one of his fellows to whom
merit or accident virtue or crime has given notoriety what has
brought the white man into the camp of the delawares

my necessities i come for food shelter and friends

it cannot be the woods are full of game the head of a warrior needs
no other shelter than a sky without clouds and the delawares are the
enemies and not the friends of the yengeese go the mouth has spoken
while the heart said nothing

duncan a little at a loss in what manner to proceed remained silent
but the scout who had listened attentively to all that passed now
advanced steadily to the front

that i did not answer to the call for la longue carabine was not owing
either to shame or fear he said for neither one nor the other is the
gift of an honest man but i do not admit the right of the mingoes to
bestow a name on one whose friends have been mindful of his gifts in
this particular especially as their title is a lie killdeer being a
grooved barrel and no carabyne i am the man however that got the name
of nathaniel from my kin the compliment of hawkeye from the delawares
who live on their own river and whom the iroquois have presumed to
style the long rifle without any warranty from him who is most
concerned in the matter

the eyes of all present which had hitherto been gravely scanning the
person of duncan were now turned on the instant toward the upright
iron frame of this new pretender to the distinguished appellation it
was in no degree remarkable that there should be found two who were
willing to claim so great an honor for impostors though rare were not
unknown among the natives but it was altogether material to the just
and severe intentions of the delawares that there should be no mistake
in the matter some of their old men consulted together in private and
then as it would seem they determined to interrogate their visitor on
the subject

my brother has said that a snake crept into my camp said the chief to
magua which is he

the huron pointed to the scout

will a wise delaware believe the barking of a wolf exclaimed duncan
still more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy a dog
never lies but when was a wolf known to speak the truth

the eyes of magua flashed fire but suddenly recollecting the necessity
of maintaining his presence of mind he turned away in silent disdain
well assured that the sagacity of the indians would not fail to extract
the real merits of the point in controversy he was not deceived for
after another short consultation the wary delaware turned to him
again and expressed the determination of the chiefs though in the most
considerate language

my brother has been called a liar he said and his friends are
angry they will show that he has spoken the truth give my prisoners
guns and let them prove which is the man

magua affected to consider the expedient which he well knew proceeded
from distrust of himself as a compliment and made a gesture of
acquiescence well content that his veracity should be supported by so
skillful a marksman as the scout the weapons were instantly placed in
the hands of the friendly opponents and they were bid to fire over
the heads of the seated multitude at an earthen vessel which lay by
accident on a stump some fifty yards from the place where they stood

heyward smiled to himself at the idea of a competition with the scout
though he determined to persevere in the deception until apprised of
the real designs of magua

raising his rifle with the utmost care and renewing his aim three
several times he fired the bullet cut the wood within a few inches of
the vessel and a general exclamation of satisfaction announced that the
shot was considered a proof of great skill in the use of a weapon
even hawkeye nodded his head as if he would say it was better than he
expected but instead of manifesting an intention to contend with
the successful marksman he stood leaning on his rifle for more than
a minute like a man who was completely buried in thought from this
reverie he was however awakened by one of the young indians who
had furnished the arms and who now touched his shoulder saying in
exceedingly broken english

can the pale face beat it

yes huron exclaimed the scout raising the short rifle in his right
hand and shaking it at magua with as much apparent ease as if it were
a reed yes huron i could strike you now and no power on earth could
prevent the deed the soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than
i am this moment of you did i choose to send a bullet to your heart
why should i not why because the gifts of my color forbid it and i
might draw down evil on tender and innocent heads if you know such a
being as god thank him therefore in your inward soul for you have
reason

the flushed countenance angry eye and swelling figure of the scout
produced a sensation of secret awe in all that heard him the delawares
held their breath in expectation but magua himself even while he
distrusted the forbearance of his enemy remained immovable and calm
where he stood wedged in by the crowd as one who grew to the spot

beat it repeated the young delaware at the elbow of the scout

beat what fool what exclaimed hawkeye still flourishing the
weapon angrily above his head though his eye no longer sought the
person of magua

if the white man is the warrior he pretends said the aged chief let
him strike nigher to the mark

the scout laughed aloud a noise that produced the startling effect of
an unnatural sound on heyward then dropping the piece heavily into
his extended left hand it was discharged apparently by the shock
driving the fragments of the vessel into the air and scattering them on
every side almost at the same instant the rattling sound of the rifle
was heard as he suffered it to fall contemptuously to the earth

the first impression of so strange a scene was engrossing admiration
then a low but increasing murmur ran through the multitude and
finally swelled into sounds that denoted a lively opposition in
the sentiments of the spectators while some openly testified their
satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity by far the larger portion
of the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the
result of accident heyward was not slow to confirm an opinion that was
so favorable to his own pretensions

it was chance he exclaimed none can shoot without an aim

chance echoed the excited woodsman who was now stubbornly bent on
maintaining his identity at every hazard and on whom the secret hints
of heyward to acquiesce in the deception were entirely lost does
yonder lying huron too think it chance give him another gun and
place us face to face without cover or dodge and let providence and
our own eyes decide the matter atween us i do not make the offer to
you major for our blood is of a color and we serve the same master

that the huron is a liar is very evident returned heyward coolly
you have yourself heard him assert you to be la longue carabine

it were impossible to say what violent assertion the stubborn hawkeye
would have next made in his headlong wish to vindicate his identity
had not the aged delaware once more interposed

the hawk which comes from the clouds can return when he will he said
give them the guns

this time the scout seized the rifle with avidity nor had magua though
he watched the movements of the marksman with jealous eyes any further
cause for apprehension

now let it be proved in the face of this tribe of delawares which
is the better man cried the scout tapping the butt of his piece with
that finger which had pulled so many fatal triggers

you see that gourd hanging against yonder tree major if you are a
marksman fit for the borders let me see you break its shell

duncan noted the object and prepared himself to renew the trial the
gourd was one of the usual little vessels used by the indians and
it was suspended from a dead branch of a small pine by a thong
of deerskin at the full distance of a hundred yards so strangely
compounded is the feeling of self-love that the young soldier while
he knew the utter worthlessness of the suffrages of his savage umpires
forgot the sudden motives of the contest in a wish to excel it had been
seen already that his skill was far from being contemptible and he
now resolved to put forth its nicest qualities had his life depended
on the issue the aim of duncan could not have been more deliberate or
guarded he fired and three or four young indians who sprang forward
at the report announced with a shout that the ball was in the tree
a very little on one side of the proper object the warriors uttered a
common ejaculation of pleasure and then turned their eyes inquiringly
on the movements of his rival

it may do for the royal americans said hawkeye laughing once more in
his own silent heartfelt manner but had my gun often turned so much
from the true line many a marten whose skin is now in a lady's muff
would still be in the woods ay and many a bloody mingo who has
departed to his final account would be acting his deviltries at this
very day atween the provinces i hope the squaw who owns the gourd has
more of them in her wigwam for this will never hold water again

the scout had shook his priming and cocked his piece while speaking
and as he ended he threw back a foot and slowly raised the muzzle
from the earth the motion was steady uniform and in one direction
when on a perfect level it remained for a single moment without tremor
or variation as though both man and rifle were carved in stone during
that stationary instant it poured forth its contents in a bright
glancing sheet of flame again the young indians bounded forward but
their hurried search and disappointed looks announced that no traces of
the bullet were to be seen

go said the old chief to the scout in a tone of strong disgust
thou art a wolf in the skin of a dog i will talk to the long rifle
of the yengeese

ah had i that piece which furnished the name you use i would obligate
myself to cut the thong and drop the gourd without breaking it
returned hawkeye perfectly undisturbed by the other's manner fools
if you would find the bullet of a sharpshooter in these woods you must
look in the object and not around it

the indian youths instantly comprehended his meaning for this time he
spoke in the delaware tongue and tearing the gourd from the tree they
held it on high with an exulting shout displaying a hole in its bottom
which had been cut by the bullet after passing through the usual
orifice in the center of its upper side at this unexpected exhibition
a loud and vehement expression of pleasure burst from the mouth of every
warrior present it decided the question and effectually established
hawkeye in the possession of his dangerous reputation those curious
and admiring eyes which had been turned again on heyward were finally
directed to the weather-beaten form of the scout who immediately became
the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophisticated
beings by whom he was surrounded when the sudden and noisy commotion
had a little subsided the aged chief resumed his examination

why did you wish to stop my ears he said addressing duncan are
the delawares fools that they could not know the young panther from the
cat

they will yet find the huron a singing-bird said duncan endeavoring
to adopt the figurative language of the natives

it is good we will know who can shut the ears of men brother added
the chief turning his eyes on magua the delawares listen

thus singled and directly called on to declare his object the huron
arose and advancing with great deliberation and dignity into the very
center of the circle where he stood confronted by the prisoners
he placed himself in an attitude to speak before opening his mouth
however he bent his eyes slowly along the whole living boundary of
earnest faces as if to temper his expressions to the capacities of his
audience on hawkeye he cast a glance of respectful enmity on duncan
a look of inextinguishable hatred the shrinking figure of alice
he scarcely deigned to notice but when his glance met the firm
commanding and yet lovely form of cora his eye lingered a moment with
an expression that it might have been difficult to define then filled
with his own dark intentions he spoke in the language of the canadas a
tongue that he well knew was comprehended by most of his auditors

the spirit that made men colored them differently commenced the
subtle huron some are blacker than the sluggish bear these he said
should be slaves and he ordered them to work forever like the beaver
you may hear them groan when the south wind blows louder than the
lowing buffaloes along the shores of the great salt lake where the big
canoes come and go with them in droves some he made with faces paler
than the ermine of the forests and these he ordered to be traders
dogs to their women and wolves to their slaves he gave this people the
nature of the pigeon wings that never tire young more plentiful than
the leaves on the trees and appetites to devour the earth he gave them
tongues like the false call of the wildcat hearts like rabbits the
cunning of the hog but none of the fox and arms longer than the legs
of the moose with his tongue he stops the ears of the indians his
heart teaches him to pay warriors to fight his battles his cunning
tells him how to get together the goods of the earth and his arms
inclose the land from the shores of the salt-water to the islands of the
great lake his gluttony makes him sick god gave him enough and yet he
wants all such are the pale faces

some the great spirit made with skins brighter and redder than yonder
sun continued magua pointing impressively upward to the lurid
luminary which was struggling through the misty atmosphere of the
horizon and these did he fashion to his own mind he gave them this
island as he had made it covered with trees and filled with game the
wind made their clearings the sun and rain ripened their fruits and
the snows came to tell them to be thankful what need had they of roads
to journey by they saw through the hills when the beavers worked they
lay in the shade and looked on the winds cooled them in summer in
winter skins kept them warm if they fought among themselves it was
to prove that they were men they were brave they were just they were
happy

here the speaker paused and again looked around him to discover if his
legend had touched the sympathies of his listeners he met everywhere
with eyes riveted on his own heads erect and nostrils expanded as
if each individual present felt himself able and willing singly to
redress the wrongs of his race

if the great spirit gave different tongues to his red children he
continued in a low still melancholy voice it was that all animals
might understand them some he placed among the snows with their
cousin the bear some he placed near the setting sun on the road to
the happy hunting grounds some on the lands around the great fresh
waters but to his greatest and most beloved he gave the sands of the
salt lake do my brothers know the name of this favored people

it was the lenape exclaimed twenty eager voices in a breath

it was the lenni lenape returned magua affecting to bend his head in
reverence to their former greatness it was the tribes of the lenape
the sun rose from water that was salt and set in water that was sweet
and never hid himself from their eyes but why should i a huron of the
woods tell a wise people their own traditions why remind them of
their injuries their ancient greatness their deeds their glory their
happiness their losses their defeats their misery is there not one
among them who has seen it all and who knows it to be true i have
done my tongue is still for my heart is of lead i listen

as the voice of the speaker suddenly ceased every face and all eyes
turned by a common movement toward the venerable tamenund from the
moment that he took his seat until the present instant the lips of the
patriarch had not severed and scarcely a sign of life had escaped him
he sat bent in feebleness and apparently unconscious of the presence
he was in during the whole of that opening scene in which the skill of
the scout had been so clearly established at the nicely graduated sound
of magua's voice however he betrayed some evidence of consciousness
and once or twice he even raised his head as if to listen but when
the crafty huron spoke of his nation by name the eyelids of the old man
raised themselves and he looked out upon the multitude with that sort
of dull unmeaning expression which might be supposed to belong to the
countenance of a specter then he made an effort to rise and being
upheld by his supporters he gained his feet in a posture commanding by
its dignity while he tottered with weakness

who calls upon the children of the lenape he said in a deep
guttural voice that was rendered awfully audible by the breathless
silence of the multitude who speaks of things gone does not the egg
become a worm the worm a fly and perish why tell the delawares of
good that is past better thank the manitou for that which remains

it is a wyandot said magua stepping nigher to the rude platform on
which the other stood a friend of tamenund

a friend repeated the sage on whose brow a dark frown settled
imparting a portion of that severity which had rendered his eye so
terrible in middle age are the mingoes rulers of the earth what
brings a huron in here

justice his prisoners are with his brothers and he comes for his
own

tamenund turned his head toward one of his supporters and listened to
the short explanation the man gave

then facing the applicant he regarded him a moment with deep
attention after which he said in a low and reluctant voice

justice is the law of the great manitou my children give the stranger
food then huron take thine own and depart

on the delivery of this solemn judgment the patriarch seated himself
and closed his eyes again as if better pleased with the images of
his own ripened experience than with the visible objects of the world
against such a decree there was no delaware sufficiently hardy to
murmur much less oppose himself the words were barely uttered when
four or five of the younger warriors stepping behind heyward and the
scout passed thongs so dexterously and rapidly around their arms as
to hold them both in instant bondage the former was too much engrossed
with his precious and nearly insensible burden to be aware of their
intentions before they were executed and the latter who considered
even the hostile tribes of the delawares a superior race of beings
submitted without resistance perhaps however the manner of the scout
would not have been so passive had he fully comprehended the language
in which the preceding dialogue had been conducted

magua cast a look of triumph around the whole assembly before he
proceeded to the execution of his purpose perceiving that the men were
unable to offer any resistance he turned his looks on her he valued
most cora met his gaze with an eye so calm and firm that his
resolution wavered then recollecting his former artifice he raised
alice from the arms of the warrior against whom she leaned and
beckoning heyward to follow he motioned for the encircling crowd to
open but cora instead of obeying the impulse he had expected rushed
to the feet of the patriarch and raising her voice exclaimed aloud

just and venerable delaware on thy wisdom and power we lean for mercy
be deaf to yonder artful and remorseless monster who poisons thy ears
with falsehoods to feed his thirst for blood thou that hast lived long
and that hast seen the evil of the world should know how to temper its
calamities to the miserable

the eyes of the old man opened heavily and he once more looked upward
at the multitude as the piercing tones of the suppliant swelled on
his ears they moved slowly in the direction of her person and finally
settled there in a steady gaze cora had cast herself to her knees
and with hands clenched in each other and pressed upon her bosom she
remained like a beauteous and breathing model of her sex looking up in
his faded but majestic countenance with a species of holy reverence
gradually the expression of tamenund's features changed and losing
their vacancy in admiration they lighted with a portion of that
intelligence which a century before had been wont to communicate his
youthful fire to the extensive bands of the delawares rising without
assistance and seemingly without an effort he demanded in a voice
that startled its auditors by its firmness

what art thou

a woman one of a hated race if thou wilt a yengee but one who has
never harmed thee and who cannot harm thy people if she would who
asks for succor

tell me my children continued the patriarch hoarsely motioning to
those around him though his eyes still dwelt upon the kneeling form of
cora where have the delawares camped

in the mountains of the iroquois beyond the clear springs of the
horican

many parching summers are come and gone continued the sage since
i drank of the water of my own rivers the children of minquon are the
justest white men but they were thirsty and they took it to themselves
do they follow us so far

 william penn was termed minquon by the delawares and as
 he never used violence or injustice in his dealings with
 them his reputation for probity passed into a proverb the
 american is justly proud of the origin of his nation which
 is perhaps unequaled in the history of the world but the
 pennsylvanian and jerseyman have more reason to value
 themselves in their ancestors than the natives of any other
 state since no wrong was done the original owners of the
 soil

we follow none we covet nothing answered cora captives against our
wills have we been brought amongst you and we ask but permission
to depart to our own in peace art thou not tamenund the father the
judge i had almost said the prophet of this people

i am tamenund of many days

tis now some seven years that one of thy people was at the mercy of
a white chief on the borders of this province he claimed to be of the
blood of the good and just tamenund go said the white man for
thy parent's sake thou art free dost thou remember the name of that
english warrior

i remember that when a laughing boy returned the patriarch with the
peculiar recollection of vast age i stood upon the sands of the sea
shore and saw a big canoe with wings whiter than the swan's and wider
than many eagles come from the rising sun

nay nay i speak not of a time so very distant but of favor shown to
thy kindred by one of mine within the memory of thy youngest warrior

was it when the yengeese and the dutchmanne fought for the
hunting-grounds of the delawares then tamenund was a chief and first
laid aside the bow for the lightning of the pale faces 

not yet then interrupted cora by many ages i speak of a thing of
yesterday surely surely you forget it not

it was but yesterday rejoined the aged man with touching pathos
that the children of the lenape were masters of the world the fishes
of the salt lake the birds the beasts and the mengee of the woods
owned them for sagamores

cora bowed her head in disappointment and for a bitter moment
struggled with her chagrin then elevating her rich features and
beaming eyes she continued in tones scarcely less penetrating than the
unearthly voice of the patriarch himself

tell me is tamenund a father

the old man looked down upon her from his elevated stand with a
benignant smile on his wasted countenance and then casting his eyes
slowly over the whole assemblage he answered

of a nation

for myself i ask nothing like thee and thine venerable chief she
continued pressing her hands convulsively on her heart and suffering
her head to droop until her burning cheeks were nearly concealed in the
maze of dark glossy tresses that fell in disorder upon her shoulders
the curse of my ancestors has fallen heavily on their child but yonder
is one who has never known the weight of heaven's displeasure until now
she is the daughter of an old and failing man whose days are near their
close she has many very many to love her and delight in her and she
is too good much too precious to become the victim of that villain

i know that the pale faces are a proud and hungry race i know that
they claim not only to have the earth but that the meanest of their
color is better than the sachems of the red man the dogs and crows of
their tribes continued the earnest old chieftain without heeding the
wounded spirit of his listener whose head was nearly crushed to the
earth in shame as he proceeded would bark and caw before they would
take a woman to their wigwams whose blood was not of the color of snow
but let them not boast before the face of the manitou too loud they
entered the land at the rising and may yet go off at the setting sun
i have often seen the locusts strip the leaves from the trees but the
season of blossoms has always come again

it is so said cora drawing a long breath as if reviving from a
trance raising her face and shaking back her shining veil with
a kindling eye that contradicted the death-like paleness of her
countenance but why it is not permitted us to inquire there is yet
one of thine own people who has not been brought before thee before
thou lettest the huron depart in triumph hear him speak

observing tamenund to look about him doubtingly one of his companions
said

it is a snake a red-skin in the pay of the yengeese we keep him for
the torture

let him come returned the sage

then tamenund once more sank into his seat and a silence so deep
prevailed while the young man prepared to obey his simple mandate that
the leaves which fluttered in the draught of the light morning air
were distinctly heard rustling in the surrounding forest




chapter 

 if you deny me fie upon your law
 there is no force in the decrees of venice
 i stand for judgment answer shall i have it
 merchant of venice

the silence continued unbroken by human sounds for many anxious minutes
then the waving multitude opened and shut again and uncas stood in the
living circle all those eyes which had been curiously studying the
lineaments of the sage as the source of their own intelligence turned
on the instant and were now bent in secret admiration on the erect
agile and faultless person of the captive but neither the presence in
which he found himself nor the exclusive attention that he attracted
in any manner disturbed the self-possession of the young mohican he
cast a deliberate and observing look on every side of him meeting
the settled expression of hostility that lowered in the visages of
the chiefs with the same calmness as the curious gaze of the attentive
children but when last in this haughty scrutiny the person of
tamenund came under his glance his eye became fixed as though all
other objects were already forgotten then advancing with a slow and
noiseless step up the area he placed himself immediately before the
footstool of the sage here he stood unnoted though keenly observant
himself until one of the chiefs apprised the latter of his presence

with what tongue does the prisoner speak to the manitou demanded the
patriarch without unclosing his eyes

like his fathers uncas replied with the tongue of a delaware

at this sudden and unexpected annunciation a low fierce yell ran
through the multitude that might not inaptly be compared to the growl
of the lion as his choler is first awakened a fearful omen of the
weight of his future anger the effect was equally strong on the sage
though differently exhibited he passed a hand before his eyes as if
to exclude the least evidence of so shameful a spectacle while he
repeated in his low guttural tones the words he had just heard

a delaware i have lived to see the tribes of the lenape driven from
their council-fires and scattered like broken herds of deer among the
hills of the iroquois i have seen the hatchets of a strong people sweep
woods from the valleys that the winds of heaven have spared the beasts
that run on the mountains and the birds that fly above the trees have
i seen living in the wigwams of men but never before have i found a
delaware so base as to creep like a poisonous serpent into the camps
of his nation

the singing-birds have opened their bills returned uncas in the
softest notes of his own musical voice and tamenund has heard their
song

the sage started and bent his head aside as if to catch the fleeting
sounds of some passing melody

does tamenund dream he exclaimed what voice is at his ear have
the winters gone backward will summer come again to the children of the
lenape

a solemn and respectful silence succeeded this incoherent burst from
the lips of the delaware prophet his people readily constructed his
unintelligible language into one of those mysterious conferences he was
believed to hold so frequently with a superior intelligence and they
awaited the issue of the revelation in awe after a patient pause
however one of the aged men perceiving that the sage had lost the
recollection of the subject before them ventured to remind him again of
the presence of the prisoner

the false delaware trembles lest he should hear the words of tamenund
he said tis a hound that howls when the yengeese show him a trail

and ye returned uncas looking sternly around him are dogs that
whine when the frenchman casts ye the offals of his deer

twenty knives gleamed in the air and as many warriors sprang to their
feet at this biting and perhaps merited retort but a motion from one
of the chiefs suppressed the outbreaking of their tempers and restored
the appearance of quiet the task might probably have been more
difficult had not a movement made by tamenund indicated that he was
again about to speak

delaware resumed the sage little art thou worthy of thy name my
people have not seen a bright sun in many winters and the warrior who
deserts his tribe when hid in clouds is doubly a traitor the law of the
manitou is just it is so while the rivers run and the mountains stand
while the blossoms come and go on the trees it must be so he is thine
my children deal justly by him

not a limb was moved nor was a breath drawn louder and longer than
common until the closing syllable of this final decree had passed the
lips of tamenund then a cry of vengeance burst at once as it might be
from the united lips of the nation a frightful augury of their ruthless
intentions in the midst of these prolonged and savage yells a chief
proclaimed in a high voice that the captive was condemned to endure
the dreadful trial of torture by fire the circle broke its order and
screams of delight mingled with the bustle and tumult of preparation
heyward struggled madly with his captors the anxious eye of hawkeye
began to look around him with an expression of peculiar earnestness
and cora again threw herself at the feet of the patriarch once more a
suppliant for mercy

throughout the whole of these trying moments uncas had alone preserved
his serenity he looked on the preparations with a steady eye and when
the tormentors came to seize him he met them with a firm and upright
attitude one among them if possible more fierce and savage than his
fellows seized the hunting-shirt of the young warrior and at a single
effort tore it from his body then with a yell of frantic pleasure
he leaped toward his unresisting victim and prepared to lead him to
the stake but at that moment when he appeared most a stranger to the
feelings of humanity the purpose of the savage was arrested as suddenly
as if a supernatural agency had interposed in the behalf of uncas the
eyeballs of the delaware seemed to start from their sockets his mouth
opened and his whole form became frozen in an attitude of amazement
raising his hand with a slow and regulated motion he pointed with a
finger to the bosom of the captive his companions crowded about him in
wonder and every eye was like his own fastened intently on the figure
of a small tortoise beautifully tattooed on the breast of the prisoner
in a bright blue tint

for a single instant uncas enjoyed his triumph smiling calmly on the
scene then motioning the crowd away with a high and haughty sweep of
his arm he advanced in front of the nation with the air of a king and
spoke in a voice louder than the murmur of admiration that ran through
the multitude

men of the lenni lenape he said my race upholds the earth your
feeble tribe stands on my shell what fire that a delaware can light
would burn the child of my fathers he added pointing proudly to the
simple blazonry on his skin the blood that came from such a stock
would smother your flames my race is the grandfather of nations

who art thou demanded tamenund rising at the startling tones
he heard more than at any meaning conveyed by the language of the
prisoner

uncas the son of chingachgook answered the captive modestly turning
from the nation and bending his head in reverence to the other's
character and years a son of the great unamis

 turtle

the hour of tamenund is nigh exclaimed the sage the day is come
at last to the night i thank the manitou that one is here to fill my
place at the council-fire uncas the child of uncas is found let the
eyes of a dying eagle gaze on the rising sun

the youth stepped lightly but proudly on the platform where he became
visible to the whole agitated and wondering multitude tamenund held him
long at the length of his arm and read every turn in the fine lineaments
of his countenance with the untiring gaze of one who recalled days of
happiness

is tamenund a boy at length the bewildered prophet exclaimed have
i dreamed of so many snows that my people were scattered like floating
sands of yengeese more plenty than the leaves on the trees the arrow
of tamenund would not frighten the fawn his arm is withered like the
branch of a dead oak the snail would be swifter in the race yet is
uncas before him as they went to battle against the pale faces uncas
the panther of his tribe the eldest son of the lenape the wisest
sagamore of the mohicans tell me ye delawares has tamenund been a
sleeper for a hundred winters

the calm and deep silence which succeeded these words sufficiently
announced the awful reverence with which his people received the
communication of the patriarch none dared to answer though all
listened in breathless expectation of what might follow uncas however
looking in his face with the fondness and veneration of a favored child
presumed on his own high and acknowledged rank to reply

four warriors of his race have lived and died he said since the
friend of tamenund led his people in battle the blood of the turtle has
been in many chiefs but all have gone back into the earth from whence
they came except chingachgook and his son

it is true it is true returned the sage a flash of recollection
destroying all his pleasing fancies and restoring him at once to a
consciousness of the true history of his nation our wise men have
often said that two warriors of the unchanged race were in the hills of
the yengeese why have their seats at the council-fires of the delawares
been so long empty

at these words the young man raised his head which he had still kept
bowed a little in reverence and lifting his voice so as to be heard
by the multitude as if to explain at once and forever the policy of his
family he said aloud

once we slept where we could hear the salt lake speak in its anger
then we were rulers and sagamores over the land but when a pale face
was seen on every brook we followed the deer back to the river of our
nation the delawares were gone few warriors of them all stayed to
drink of the stream they loved then said my fathers here will we
hunt the waters of the river go into the salt lake if we go toward
the setting sun we shall find streams that run into the great lakes of
sweet water there would a mohican die like fishes of the sea in the
clear springs when the manitou is ready and shall say come we will
follow the river to the sea and take our own again such delawares
is the belief of the children of the turtle our eyes are on the rising
and not toward the setting sun we know whence he comes but we know not
whither he goes it is enough

the men of the lenape listened to his words with all the respect that
superstition could lend finding a secret charm even in the figurative
language with which the young sagamore imparted his ideas uncas himself
watched the effect of his brief explanation with intelligent eyes and
gradually dropped the air of authority he had assumed as he perceived
that his auditors were content then permitting his looks to wander
over the silent throng that crowded around the elevated seat of
tamenund he first perceived hawkeye in his bonds stepping eagerly
from his stand he made way for himself to the side of his friend and
cutting his thongs with a quick and angry stroke of his own knife he
motioned to the crowd to divide the indians silently obeyed and once
more they stood ranged in their circle as before his appearance among
them uncas took the scout by the hand and led him to the feet of the
patriarch

father he said look at this pale face a just man and the friend
of the delawares

is he a son of minquon

not so a warrior known to the yengeese and feared by the maquas

what name has he gained by his deeds

we call him hawkeye uncas replied using the delaware phrase for
his sight never fails the mingoes know him better by the death he gives
their warriors with them he is the long rifle

la longue carabine exclaimed tamenund opening his eyes and
regarding the scout sternly my son has not done well to call him
friend

i call him so who proves himself such returned the young chief with
great calmness but with a steady mien if uncas is welcome among the
delawares then is hawkeye with his friends

the pale face has slain my young men his name is great for the blows
he has struck the lenape

if a mingo has whispered that much in the ear of the delaware he has
only shown that he is a singing-bird said the scout who now believed
that it was time to vindicate himself from such offensive charges
and who spoke as the man he addressed modifying his indian figures
however with his own peculiar notions that i have slain the maquas
i am not the man to deny even at their own council-fires but that
knowingly my hand has never harmed a delaware is opposed to the reason
of my gifts which is friendly to them and all that belongs to their
nation

a low exclamation of applause passed among the warriors who exchanged
looks with each other like men that first began to perceive their error

where is the huron demanded tamenund has he stopped my ears

magua whose feelings during that scene in which uncas had triumphed may
be much better imagined than described answered to the call by stepping
boldly in front of the patriarch

the just tamenund he said will not keep what a huron has lent

tell me son of my brother returned the sage avoiding the dark
countenance of le subtil and turning gladly to the more ingenuous
features of uncas has the stranger a conqueror's right over you

he has none the panther may get into snares set by the women but he
is strong and knows how to leap through them

la longue carabine

laughs at the mingoes go huron ask your squaws the color of a bear

the stranger and white maiden that come into my camp together

should journey on an open path

and the woman that huron left with my warriors

uncas made no reply

and the woman that the mingo has brought into my camp repeated
tamenund gravely

she is mine cried magua shaking his hand in triumph at uncas
mohican you know that she is mine

my son is silent said tamenund endeavoring to read the expression of
the face that the youth turned from him in sorrow

it is so was the low answer

a short and impressive pause succeeded during which it was very
apparent with what reluctance the multitude admitted the justice of the
mingo's claim at length the sage on whom alone the decision depended
said in a firm voice

huron depart

as he came just tamenund demanded the wily magua or with hands
filled with the faith of the delawares the wigwam of le renard subtil
is empty make him strong with his own

the aged man mused with himself for a time and then bending his head
toward one of his venerable companions he asked

are my ears open

it is true

is this mingo a chief

the first in his nation

girl what wouldst thou a great warrior takes thee to wife go thy
race will not end

better a thousand times it should exclaimed the horror-struck cora
than meet with such a degradation

huron her mind is in the tents of her fathers an unwilling maiden
makes an unhappy wigwam

she speaks with the tongue of her people returned magua regarding
his victim with a look of bitter irony

she is of a race of traders and will bargain for a bright look let
tamenund speak the words

take you the wampum and our love

nothing hence but what magua brought hither

then depart with thine own the great manitou forbids that a delaware
should be unjust

magua advanced and seized his captive strongly by the arm the
delawares fell back in silence and cora as if conscious that
remonstrance would be useless prepared to submit to her fate without
resistance

hold hold cried duncan springing forward huron have mercy her
ransom shall make thee richer than any of thy people were ever yet known
to be

magua is a red-skin he wants not the beads of the pale faces

gold silver powder lead all that a warrior needs shall be in thy
wigwam all that becomes the greatest chief

le subtil is very strong cried magua violently shaking the hand
which grasped the unresisting arm of cora he has his revenge

mighty ruler of providence exclaimed heyward clasping his hands
together in agony can this be suffered to you just tamenund i
appeal for mercy

the words of the delaware are said returned the sage closing his
eyes and dropping back into his seat alike wearied with his mental and
his bodily exertion men speak not twice

that a chief should not misspend his time in unsaying what has once
been spoken is wise and reasonable said hawkeye motioning to duncan
to be silent but it is also prudent in every warrior to consider well
before he strikes his tomahawk into the head of his prisoner huron i
love you not nor can i say that any mingo has ever received much favor
at my hands it is fair to conclude that if this war does not soon end
many more of your warriors will meet me in the woods put it to your
judgment then whether you would prefer taking such a prisoner as that
into your encampment or one like myself who am a man that it would
greatly rejoice your nation to see with naked hands

will the long rifle give his life for the woman demanded magua
hesitatingly for he had already made a motion toward quitting the place
with his victim

no no i have not said so much as that returned hawkeye drawing
back with suitable discretion when he noted the eagerness with which
magua listened to his proposal it would be an unequal exchange to
give a warrior in the prime of his age and usefulness for the best
woman on the frontiers i might consent to go into winter quarters now
 at least six weeks afore the leaves will turn on condition you will
release the maiden

magua shook his head and made an impatient sign for the crowd to open

well then added the scout with the musing air of a man who had not
half made up his mind i will throw killdeer into the bargain take
the word of an experienced hunter the piece has not its equal atween
the provinces

magua still disdained to reply continuing his efforts to disperse the
crowd

perhaps added the scout losing his dissembled coolness exactly in
proportion as the other manifested an indifference to the exchange
if i should condition to teach your young men the real virtue of the
we'pon it would smoothe the little differences in our judgments

le renard fiercely ordered the delawares who still lingered in an
impenetrable belt around him in hopes he would listen to the amicable
proposal to open his path threatening by the glance of his eye
another appeal to the infallible justice of their prophet

what is ordered must sooner or later arrive continued hawkeye
turning with a sad and humbled look to uncas the varlet knows his
advantage and will keep it god bless you boy you have found friends
among your natural kin and i hope they will prove as true as some you
have met who had no indian cross as for me sooner or later i
must die it is therefore fortunate there are but few to make my
death-howl after all it is likely the imps would have managed to
master my scalp so a day or two will make no great difference in
the everlasting reckoning of time god bless you added the rugged
woodsman bending his head aside and then instantly changing its
direction again with a wistful look toward the youth i loved both you
and your father uncas though our skins are not altogether of a color
and our gifts are somewhat different tell the sagamore i never lost
sight of him in my greatest trouble and as for you think of me
sometimes when on a lucky trail and depend on it boy whether there
be one heaven or two there is a path in the other world by which honest
men may come together again you'll find the rifle in the place we hid
it take it and keep it for my sake and harkee lad as your natural
gifts don't deny you the use of vengeance use it a little freely on the
mingoes it may unburden griefs at my loss and ease your mind huron i
accept your offer release the woman i am your prisoner

a suppressed but still distinct murmur of approbation ran through the
crowd at this generous proposition even the fiercest among the
delaware warriors manifesting pleasure at the manliness of the intended
sacrifice magua paused and for an anxious moment it might be said
he doubted then casting his eyes on cora with an expression in which
ferocity and admiration were strangely mingled his purpose became fixed
forever

he intimated his contempt of the offer with a backward motion of his
head and said in a steady and settled voice

le renard subtil is a great chief he has but one mind come he
added laying his hand too familiarly on the shoulder of his captive to
urge her onward a huron is no tattler we will go

the maiden drew back in lofty womanly reserve and her dark eye kindled
while the rich blood shot like the passing brightness of the sun into
her very temples at the indignity

i am your prisoner and at a fitting time shall be ready to follow
even to my death but violence is unnecessary she coldly said and
immediately turning to hawkeye added generous hunter from my soul i
thank you your offer is vain neither could it be accepted but still
you may serve me even more than in your own noble intention look at
that drooping humbled child abandon her not until you leave her in the
habitations of civilized men i will not say wringing the hard hand of
the scout that her father will reward you for such as you are above
the rewards of men but he will thank you and bless you and believe
me the blessing of a just and aged man has virtue in the sight of
heaven would to god i could hear one word from his lips at this awful
moment her voice became choked and for an instant she was silent
then advancing a step nigher to duncan who was supporting her
unconscious sister she continued in more subdued tones but in which
feeling and the habits of her sex maintained a fearful struggle i need
not tell you to cherish the treasure you will possess you love her
heyward that would conceal a thousand faults though she had them she
is kind gentle sweet good as mortal may be there is not a blemish
in mind or person at which the proudest of you all would sicken she
is fair oh how surpassingly fair laying her own beautiful but less
brilliant hand in melancholy affection on the alabaster forehead of
alice and parting the golden hair which clustered about her brows and
yet her soul is pure and spotless as her skin i could say much more
perhaps than cooler reason would approve but i will spare you and
myself her voice became inaudible and her face was bent over the
form of her sister after a long and burning kiss she arose and with
features of the hue of death but without even a tear in her feverish
eye she turned away and added to the savage with all her former
elevation of manner now sir if it be your pleasure i will follow

ay go cried duncan placing alice in the arms of an indian girl
go magua go these delawares have their laws which forbid them to
detain you but i i have no such obligation go malignant monster why
do you delay

it would be difficult to describe the expression with which magua
listened to this threat to follow there was at first a fierce and
manifest display of joy and then it was instantly subdued in a look of
cunning coldness

the words are open he was content with answering the open hand
can come

hold cried hawkeye seizing duncan by the arm and detaining him by
violence you know not the craft of the imp he would lead you to an
ambushment and your death 

huron interrupted uncas who submissive to the stern customs of his
people had been an attentive and grave listener to all that passed
huron the justice of the delawares comes from the manitou look at the
sun he is now in the upper branches of the hemlock your path is short
and open when he is seen above the trees there will be men on your
trail

i hear a crow exclaimed magua with a taunting laugh go he added
shaking his hand at the crowd which had slowly opened to admit his
passage where are the petticoats of the delawares let them send their
arrows and their guns to the wyandots they shall have venison to eat
and corn to hoe dogs rabbits thieves i spit on you

his parting gibes were listened to in a dead boding silence and with
these biting words in his mouth the triumphant magua passed unmolested
into the forest followed by his passive captive and protected by the
inviolable laws of indian hospitality

so long as their enemy and his victim continued in sight the multitude
remained motionless as beings charmed to the place by some power that
was friendly to the huron but the instant he disappeared it became
tossed and agitated by fierce and powerful passion uncas maintained his
elevated stand keeping his eyes on the form of cora until the colors
of her dress were blended with the foliage of the forest when he
descended and moving silently through the throng he disappeared in
that lodge from which he had so recently issued a few of the graver and
more attentive warriors who caught the gleams of anger that shot from
the eyes of the young chief in passing followed him to the place he
had selected for his meditations after which tamenund and alice were
removed and the women and children were ordered to disperse during
the momentous hour that succeeded the encampment resembled a hive of
troubled bees who only awaited the appearance and example of their
leader to take some distant and momentous flight

a young warrior at length issued from the lodge of uncas and moving
deliberately with a sort of grave march toward a dwarf pine that grew
in the crevices of the rocky terrace he tore the bark from its body
and then turned whence he came without speaking he was soon followed
by another who stripped the sapling of its branches leaving it a naked
and blazed trunk a third colored the post with stripes of a dark red
paint all which indications of a hostile design in the leaders of the
nation were received by the men without in a gloomy and ominous silence
finally the mohican himself reappeared divested of all his attire
except his girdle and leggings and with one-half of his fine features
hid under a cloud of threatening black

 a tree which has been partially or entirely stripped of
 its bark is said in the language of the country to be
 blazed the term is strictly english for a horse is said
 to be blazed when it has a white mark

uncas moved with a slow and dignified tread toward the post which he
immediately commenced encircling with a measured step not unlike an
ancient dance raising his voice at the same time in the wild and
irregular chant of his war song the notes were in the extremes of
human sounds being sometimes melancholy and exquisitely plaintive
even rivaling the melody of birds and then by sudden and startling
transitions causing the auditors to tremble by their depth and energy
the words were few and often repeated proceeding gradually from a sort
of invocation or hymn to the deity to an intimation of the warrior's
object and terminating as they commenced with an acknowledgment of his
own dependence on the great spirit if it were possible to translate the
comprehensive and melodious language in which he spoke the ode might
read something like the following manitou manitou manitou thou art
great thou art good thou art wise manitou manitou thou art just in
the heavens in the clouds oh i see many spots many dark many red
in the heavens oh i see many clouds

in the woods in the air oh i hear the whoop the long yell and the
cry in the woods oh i hear the loud whoop

manitou manitou manitou i am weak thou art strong i am slow
manitou manitou give me aid

at the end of what might be called each verse he made a pause by
raising a note louder and longer than common that was peculiarly
suited to the sentiment just expressed the first close was solemn
and intended to convey the idea of veneration the second descriptive
bordering on the alarming and the third was the well-known and terrific
war-whoop which burst from the lips of the young warrior like a
combination of all the frightful sounds of battle the last was like the
first humble and imploring three times did he repeat this song and as
often did he encircle the post in his dance

at the close of the first turn a grave and highly esteemed chief of the
lenape followed his example singing words of his own however to music
of a similar character warrior after warrior enlisted in the dance
until all of any renown and authority were numbered in its mazes the
spectacle now became wildly terrific the fierce-looking and menacing
visages of the chiefs receiving additional power from the appalling
strains in which they mingled their guttural tones just then uncas
struck his tomahawk deep into the post and raised his voice in a shout
which might be termed his own battle cry the act announced that he had
assumed the chief authority in the intended expedition

it was a signal that awakened all the slumbering passions of the nation
a hundred youths who had hitherto been restrained by the diffidence
of their years rushed in a frantic body on the fancied emblem of their
enemy and severed it asunder splinter by splinter until nothing
remained of the trunk but its roots in the earth during this moment of
tumult the most ruthless deeds of war were performed on the fragments
of the tree with as much apparent ferocity as if they were the living
victims of their cruelty some were scalped some received the keen and
trembling axe and others suffered by thrusts from the fatal knife in
short the manifestations of zeal and fierce delight were so great and
unequivocal that the expedition was declared to be a war of the nation

the instant uncas had struck the blow he moved out of the circle and
cast his eyes up to the sun which was just gaining the point when
the truce with magua was to end the fact was soon announced by a
significant gesture accompanied by a corresponding cry and the whole
of the excited multitude abandoned their mimic warfare with shrill
yells of pleasure to prepare for the more hazardous experiment of the
reality

the whole face of the encampment was instantly changed the warriors
who were already armed and painted became as still as if they were
incapable of any uncommon burst of emotion on the other hand the women
broke out of the lodges with the songs of joy and those of lamentation
so strangely mixed that it might have been difficult to have said which
passion preponderated none however was idle some bore their choicest
articles others their young and some their aged and infirm into
the forest which spread itself like a verdant carpet of bright green
against the side of the mountain thither tamenund also retired with
calm composure after a short and touching interview with uncas from
whom the sage separated with the reluctance that a parent would quit a
long lost and just recovered child in the meantime duncan saw alice
to a place of safety and then sought the scout with a countenance that
denoted how eagerly he also panted for the approaching contest

but hawkeye was too much accustomed to the war song and the enlistments
of the natives to betray any interest in the passing scene he merely
cast an occasional look at the number and quality of the warriors who
from time to time signified their readiness to accompany uncas to
the field in this particular he was soon satisfied for as has been
already seen the power of the young chief quickly embraced every
fighting man in the nation after this material point was so
satisfactorily decided he despatched an indian boy in quest of
killdeer and the rifle of uncas to the place where they had deposited
their weapons on approaching the camp of the delawares a measure of
double policy inasmuch as it protected the arms from their own fate
if detained as prisoners and gave them the advantage of appearing among
the strangers rather as sufferers than as men provided with means of
defense and subsistence in selecting another to perform the office of
reclaiming his highly prized rifle the scout had lost sight of none of
his habitual caution he knew that magua had not come unattended and he
also knew that huron spies watched the movements of their new enemies
along the whole boundary of the woods it would therefore have been
fatal to himself to have attempted the experiment a warrior would have
fared no better but the danger of a boy would not be likely to commence
until after his object was discovered when heyward joined him the
scout was coolly awaiting the result of this experiment

the boy who had been well instructed and was sufficiently crafty
proceeded with a bosom that was swelling with the pride of such a
confidence and all the hopes of young ambition carelessly across
the clearing to the wood which he entered at a point at some little
distance from the place where the guns were secreted the instant
however he was concealed by the foliage of the bushes his dusky form
was to be seen gliding like that of a serpent toward the desired
treasure he was successful and in another moment he appeared flying
across the narrow opening that skirted the base of the terrace on which
the village stood with the velocity of an arrow and bearing a prize
in each hand he had actually gained the crags and was leaping up their
sides with incredible activity when a shot from the woods showed how
accurate had been the judgment of the scout the boy answered it with a
feeble but contemptuous shout and immediately a second bullet was
sent after him from another part of the cover at the next instant he
appeared on the level above elevating his guns in triumph while he
moved with the air of a conqueror toward the renowned hunter who had
honored him by so glorious a commission

notwithstanding the lively interest hawkeye had taken in the fate of his
messenger he received killdeer with a satisfaction that momentarily
drove all other recollections from his mind after examining the piece
with an intelligent eye and opening and shutting the pan some ten or
fifteen times and trying sundry other equally important experiments on
the lock he turned to the boy and demanded with great manifestations of
kindness if he was hurt the urchin looked proudly up in his face but
made no reply

ah i see lad the knaves have barked your arm added the scout
taking up the limb of the patient sufferer across which a deep flesh
wound had been made by one of the bullets but a little bruised alder
will act like a charm in the meantime i will wrap it in a badge of
wampum you have commenced the business of a warrior early my brave
boy and are likely to bear a plenty of honorable scars to your grave
i know many young men that have taken scalps who cannot show such a mark
as this go having bound up the arm you will be a chief

the lad departed prouder of his flowing blood than the vainest courtier
could be of his blushing ribbon and stalked among the fellows of his
age an object of general admiration and envy

but in a moment of so many serious and important duties this single
act of juvenile fortitude did not attract the general notice and
commendation it would have received under milder auspices it had
however served to apprise the delawares of the position and the
intentions of their enemies accordingly a party of adventurers better
suited to the task than the weak though spirited boy was ordered to
dislodge the skulkers the duty was soon performed for most of the
hurons retired of themselves when they found they had been discovered
the delawares followed to a sufficient distance from their own
encampment and then halted for orders apprehensive of being led into
an ambush as both parties secreted themselves the woods were again as
still and quiet as a mild summer morning and deep solitude could render
them

the calm but still impatient uncas now collected his chiefs and divided
his power he presented hawkeye as a warrior often tried and always
found deserving of confidence when he found his friend met with a
favorable reception he bestowed on him the command of twenty men
like himself active skillful and resolute he gave the delawares to
understand the rank of heyward among the troops of the yengeese and
then tendered to him a trust of equal authority but duncan declined the
charge professing his readiness to serve as a volunteer by the side of
the scout after this disposition the young mohican appointed various
native chiefs to fill the different situations of responsibility and
the time pressing he gave forth the word to march he was cheerfully
but silently obeyed by more than two hundred men

their entrance into the forest was perfectly unmolested nor did they
encounter any living objects that could either give the alarm or
furnish the intelligence they needed until they came upon the lairs of
their own scouts here a halt was ordered and the chiefs were assembled
to hold a whispering council

at this meeting divers plans of operation were suggested though none
of a character to meet the wishes of their ardent leader had uncas
followed the promptings of his own inclinations he would have led his
followers to the charge without a moment's delay and put the conflict
to the hazard of an instant issue but such a course would have been in
opposition to all the received practises and opinions of his countrymen
he was therefore fain to adopt a caution that in the present temper of
his mind he execrated and to listen to advice at which his fiery
spirit chafed under the vivid recollection of cora's danger and magua's
insolence

after an unsatisfactory conference of many minutes a solitary
individual was seen advancing from the side of the enemy with such
apparent haste as to induce the belief he might be a messenger charged
with pacific overtures when within a hundred yards however of the
cover behind which the delaware council had assembled the stranger
hesitated appeared uncertain what course to take and finally halted
all eyes were turned now on uncas as if seeking directions how to
proceed

hawkeye said the young chief in a low voice he must never speak to
the hurons again

his time has come said the laconic scout thrusting the long barrel
of his rifle through the leaves and taking his deliberate and fatal
aim but instead of pulling the trigger he lowered the muzzle again
and indulged himself in a fit of his peculiar mirth i took the imp for
a mingo as i'm a miserable sinner he said but when my eye ranged
along his ribs for a place to get the bullet in would you think it
uncas i saw the musicianer's blower and so after all it is the man
they call gamut whose death can profit no one and whose life if this
tongue can do anything but sing may be made serviceable to our own
ends if sounds have not lost their virtue i'll soon have a discourse
with the honest fellow and that in a voice he'll find more agreeable
than the speech of killdeer

so saying hawkeye laid aside his rifle and crawling through the
bushes until within hearing of david he attempted to repeat the musical
effort which had conducted himself with so much safety and eclat
through the huron encampment the exquisite organs of gamut could not
readily be deceived and to say the truth it would have been
difficult for any other than hawkeye to produce a similar noise and
consequently having once before heard the sounds he now knew whence
they proceeded the poor fellow appeared relieved from a state of great
embarrassment for pursuing the direction of the voice a task that to
him was not much less arduous that it would have been to have gone up in
the face of a battery he soon discovered the hidden songster

i wonder what the hurons will think of that said the scout laughing
as he took his companion by the arm and urged him toward the rear
if the knaves lie within earshot they will say there are two
non-compossers instead of one but here we are safe he added pointing
to uncas and his associates now give us the history of the mingo
inventions in natural english and without any ups and downs of voice

david gazed about him at the fierce and wild-looking chiefs in mute
wonder but assured by the presence of faces that he knew he soon
rallied his faculties so far as to make an intelligent reply

the heathen are abroad in goodly numbers said david and i fear
with evil intent there has been much howling and ungodly revelry
together with such sounds as it is profanity to utter in their
habitations within the past hour so much so in truth that i have fled
to the delawares in search of peace

your ears might not have profited much by the exchange had you been
quicker of foot returned the scout a little dryly but let that be as
it may where are the hurons

they lie hid in the forest between this spot and their village in such
force that prudence would teach you instantly to return

uncas cast a glance along the range of trees which concealed his own
band and mentioned the name of

magua

is among them he brought in the maiden that had sojourned with the
delawares and leaving her in the cave has put himself like a raging
wolf at the head of his savages i know not what has troubled his
spirit so greatly

he has left her you say in the cave interrupted heyward tis well
that we know its situation may not something be done for her instant
relief

uncas looked earnestly at the scout before he asked

what says hawkeye

give me twenty rifles and i will turn to the right along the stream
and passing by the huts of the beaver will join the sagamore and the
colonel you shall then hear the whoop from that quarter with this wind
one may easily send it a mile then uncas do you drive in the front
when they come within range of our pieces we will give them a blow
that i pledge the good name of an old frontiersman shall make their
line bend like an ashen bow after which we will carry the village and
take the woman from the cave when the affair may be finished with the
tribe according to a white man's battle by a blow and a victory
or in the indian fashion with dodge and cover there may be no great
learning major in this plan but with courage and patience it can all
be done

i like it very much cried duncan who saw that the release of cora
was the primary object in the mind of the scout i like it much let it
be instantly attempted

after a short conference the plan was matured and rendered more
intelligible to the several parties the different signals were
appointed and the chiefs separated each to his allotted station




chapter 

 but plagues shall spread and funeral fires increase
 till the great king without a ransom paid
 to her own chrysa send the black-eyed maid
 pope

during the time uncas was making this disposition of his forces the
woods were as still and with the exception of those who had met in
council apparently as much untenanted as when they came fresh from
the hands of their almighty creator the eye could range in every
direction through the long and shadowed vistas of the trees but
nowhere was any object to be seen that did not properly belong to the
peaceful and slumbering scenery

here and there a bird was heard fluttering among the branches of the
beeches and occasionally a squirrel dropped a nut drawing the startled
looks of the party for a moment to the place but the instant the casual
interruption ceased the passing air was heard murmuring above their
heads along that verdant and undulating surface of forest which spread
itself unbroken unless by stream or lake over such a vast region of
country across the tract of wilderness which lay between the delawares
and the village of their enemies it seemed as if the foot of man had
never trodden so breathing and deep was the silence in which it lay
but hawkeye whose duty led him foremost in the adventure knew the
character of those with whom he was about to contend too well to trust
the treacherous quiet

when he saw his little band collected the scout threw killdeer into
the hollow of his arm and making a silent signal that he would be
followed he led them many rods toward the rear into the bed of a
little brook which they had crossed in advancing here he halted and
after waiting for the whole of his grave and attentive warriors to close
about him he spoke in delaware demanding

do any of my young men know whither this run will lead us

a delaware stretched forth a hand with the two fingers separated
and indicating the manner in which they were joined at the root he
answered

before the sun could go his own length the little water will be in
the big then he added pointing in the direction of the place he
mentioned the two make enough for the beavers

i thought as much returned the scout glancing his eye upward at the
opening in the tree-tops from the course it takes and the bearings of
the mountains men we will keep within the cover of its banks till we
scent the hurons

his companions gave the usual brief exclamation of assent but
perceiving that their leader was about to lead the way in person one
or two made signs that all was not as it should be hawkeye who
comprehended their meaning glances turned and perceived that his party
had been followed thus far by the singing-master

do you know friend asked the scout gravely and perhaps with a
little of the pride of conscious deserving in his manner that this is
a band of rangers chosen for the most desperate service and put under
the command of one who though another might say it with a better face
will not be apt to leave them idle it may not be five it cannot be
thirty minutes before we tread on the body of a huron living or dead

though not admonished of your intentions in words returned david
whose face was a little flushed and whose ordinarily quiet and
unmeaning eyes glimmered with an expression of unusual fire your men
have reminded me of the children of jacob going out to battle against
the shechemites for wickedly aspiring to wedlock with a woman of a race
that was favored of the lord now i have journeyed far and sojourned
much in good and evil with the maiden ye seek and though not a man
of war with my loins girded and my sword sharpened yet would i gladly
strike a blow in her behalf

the scout hesitated as if weighing the chances of such a strange
enlistment in his mind before he answered

you know not the use of any we'pon you carry no rifle and believe me
what the mingoes take they will freely give again

though not a vaunting and bloodily disposed goliath returned david
drawing a sling from beneath his parti-colored and uncouth attire i
have not forgotten the example of the jewish boy with this ancient
instrument of war have i practised much in my youth and peradventure
the skill has not entirely departed from me

ay said hawkeye considering the deer-skin thong and apron with a
cold and discouraging eye the thing might do its work among arrows or
even knives but these mengwe have been furnished by the frenchers with
a good grooved barrel a man however it seems to be your gift to go
unharmed amid fire and as you have hitherto been favored major you
have left your rifle at a cock a single shot before the time would be
just twenty scalps lost to no purpose singer you can follow we may
find use for you in the shoutings

i thank you friend returned david supplying himself like his royal
namesake from among the pebbles of the brook though not given to
the desire to kill had you sent me away my spirit would have been
troubled

remember added the scout tapping his own head significantly on that
spot where gamut was yet sore we come to fight and not to musickate
until the general whoop is given nothing speaks but the rifle

david nodded as much to signify his acquiescence with the terms and
then hawkeye casting another observant glance over his followers made
the signal to proceed

their route lay for the distance of a mile along the bed of the
water-course though protected from any great danger of observation by
the precipitous banks and the thick shrubbery which skirted the stream
no precaution known to an indian attack was neglected a warrior rather
crawled than walked on each flank so as to catch occasional glimpses
into the forest and every few minutes the band came to a halt and
listened for hostile sounds with an acuteness of organs that would be
scarcely conceivable to a man in a less natural state their march was
however unmolested and they reached the point where the lesser stream
was lost in the greater without the smallest evidence that their
progress had been noted here the scout again halted to consult the
signs of the forest

we are likely to have a good day for a fight he said in english
addressing heyward and glancing his eyes upward at the clouds which
began to move in broad sheets across the firmament a bright sun and a
glittering barrel are no friends to true sight everything is favorable
they have the wind which will bring down their noises and their smoke
too no little matter in itself whereas with us it will be first
a shot and then a clear view but here is an end to our cover the
beavers have had the range of this stream for hundreds of years and
what atween their food and their dams there is as you see many a
girdled stub but few living trees

hawkeye had in truth in these few words given no bad description of
the prospect that now lay in their front the brook was irregular in its
width sometimes shooting through narrow fissures in the rocks and at
others spreading over acres of bottom land forming little areas that
might be termed ponds everywhere along its bands were the moldering
relics of dead trees in all the stages of decay from those that
groaned on their tottering trunks to such as had recently been robbed of
those rugged coats that so mysteriously contain their principle of life
a few long low and moss-covered piles were scattered among them like
the memorials of a former and long-departed generation

all these minute particulars were noted by the scout with a gravity and
interest that they probably had never before attracted he knew that
the huron encampment lay a short half mile up the brook and with
the characteristic anxiety of one who dreaded a hidden danger he was
greatly troubled at not finding the smallest trace of the presence of
his enemy once or twice he felt induced to give the order for a rush
and to attempt the village by surprise but his experience quickly
admonished him of the danger of so useless an experiment then he
listened intently and with painful uncertainty for the sounds of
hostility in the quarter where uncas was left but nothing was audible
except the sighing of the wind that began to sweep over the bosom of
the forest in gusts which threatened a tempest at length yielding
rather to his unusual impatience than taking counsel from his knowledge
he determined to bring matters to an issue by unmasking his force and
proceeding cautiously but steadily up the stream

the scout had stood while making his observations sheltered by a
brake and his companions still lay in the bed of the ravine through
which the smaller stream debouched but on hearing his low though
intelligible signal the whole party stole up the bank like so many
dark specters and silently arranged themselves around him pointing in
the direction he wished to proceed hawkeye advanced the band breaking
off in single files and following so accurately in his footsteps as to
leave it if we except heyward and david the trail of but a single man

the party was however scarcely uncovered before a volley from a dozen
rifles was heard in their rear and a delaware leaping high in to the
air like a wounded deer fell at his whole length dead

ah i feared some deviltry like this exclaimed the scout in english
adding with the quickness of thought in his adopted tongue to cover
men and charge

the band dispersed at the word and before heyward had well recovered
from his surprise he found himself standing alone with david luckily
the hurons had already fallen back and he was safe from their fire but
this state of things was evidently to be of short continuance for the
scout set the example of pressing on their retreat by discharging his
rifle and darting from tree to tree as his enemy slowly yielded ground

it would seem that the assault had been made by a very small party of
the hurons which however continued to increase in numbers as it
retired on its friends until the return fire was very nearly if not
quite equal to that maintained by the advancing delawares heyward
threw himself among the combatants and imitating the necessary caution
of his companions he made quick discharges with his own rifle the
contest now grew warm and stationary few were injured as both parties
kept their bodies as much protected as possible by the trees never
indeed exposing any part of their persons except in the act of taking
aim but the chances were gradually growing unfavorable to hawkeye and
his band the quick-sighted scout perceived his danger without knowing
how to remedy it he saw it was more dangerous to retreat than to
maintain his ground while he found his enemy throwing out men on his
flank which rendered the task of keeping themselves covered so very
difficult to the delawares as nearly to silence their fire at this
embarrassing moment when they began to think the whole of the hostile
tribe was gradually encircling them they heard the yell of combatants
and the rattling of arms echoing under the arches of the wood at the
place where uncas was posted a bottom which in a manner lay beneath
the ground on which hawkeye and his party were contending

the effects of this attack were instantaneous and to the scout and his
friends greatly relieving it would seem that while his own surprise
had been anticipated and had consequently failed the enemy in their
turn having been deceived in its object and in his numbers had left
too small a force to resist the impetuous onset of the young mohican
this fact was doubly apparent by the rapid manner in which the battle
in the forest rolled upward toward the village and by an instant
falling off in the number of their assailants who rushed to assist in
maintaining the front and as it now proved to be the principal point
of defense

animating his followers by his voice and his own example hawkeye then
gave the word to bear down upon their foes the charge in that rude
species of warfare consisted merely in pushing from cover to cover
nigher to the enemy and in this maneuver he was instantly and
successfully obeyed the hurons were compelled to withdraw and the
scene of the contest rapidly changed from the more open ground on which
it had commenced to a spot where the assailed found a thicket to
rest upon here the struggle was protracted arduous and seemingly of
doubtful issue the delawares though none of them fell beginning to
bleed freely in consequence of the disadvantage at which they were
held

in this crisis hawkeye found means to get behind the same tree as that
which served for a cover to heyward most of his own combatants being
within call a little on his right where they maintained rapid though
fruitless discharges on their sheltered enemies

you are a young man major said the scout dropping the butt of
killdeer to the earth and leaning on the barrel a little fatigued
with his previous industry and it may be your gift to lead armies
at some future day ag'in these imps the mingoes you may here see the
philosophy of an indian fight it consists mainly in ready hand a quick
eye and a good cover now if you had a company of the royal americans
here in what manner would you set them to work in this business

the bayonet would make a road

ay there is white reason in what you say but a man must ask himself
in this wilderness how many lives he can spare no horse continued
the scout shaking his head like one who mused horse i am ashamed to
say must sooner or later decide these scrimmages the brutes are better
than men and to horse must we come at last put a shodden hoof on the
moccasin of a red-skin and if his rifle be once emptied he will never
stop to load it again

 the american forest admits of the passage of horses there
 being little underbrush and few tangled brakes the plan of
 hawkeye is the one which has always proved the most
 successful in the battles between the whites and the
 indians wayne in his celebrated campaign on the miami
 received the fire of his enemies in line and then causing
 his dragoons to wheel round his flanks the indians were
 driven from their covers before they had time to load one
 of the most conspicuous of the chiefs who fought in the
 battle of miami assured the writer that the red men could
 not fight the warriors with long knives and leather
 stockings meaning the dragoons with their sabers and
 boots

this is a subject that might better be discussed at another time
returned heyward shall we charge

i see no contradiction to the gifts of any man in passing his breathing
spells in useful reflections the scout replied as to rush i little
relish such a measure for a scalp or two must be thrown away in the
attempt and yet he added bending his head aside to catch the sounds
of the distant combat if we are to be of use to uncas these knaves in
our front must be got rid of

then turning with a prompt and decided air he called aloud to his
indians in their own language his words were answered by a shout
and at a given signal each warrior made a swift movement around his
particular tree the sight of so many dark bodies glancing before their
eyes at the same instant drew a hasty and consequently an ineffectual
fire from the hurons without stopping to breathe the delawares leaped
in long bounds toward the wood like so many panthers springing upon
their prey hawkeye was in front brandishing his terrible rifle and
animating his followers by his example a few of the older and more
cunning hurons who had not been deceived by the artifice which had been
practiced to draw their fire now made a close and deadly discharge of
their pieces and justified the apprehensions of the scout by felling
three of his foremost warriors but the shock was insufficient to repel
the impetus of the charge the delawares broke into the cover with the
ferocity of their natures and swept away every trace of resistance by
the fury of the onset

the combat endured only for an instant hand to hand and then the
assailed yielded ground rapidly until they reached the opposite
margin of the thicket where they clung to the cover with the sort of
obstinacy that is so often witnessed in hunted brutes at this critical
moment when the success of the struggle was again becoming doubtful
the crack of a rifle was heard behind the hurons and a bullet came
whizzing from among some beaver lodges which were situated in the
clearing in their rear and was followed by the fierce and appalling
yell of the war-whoop

there speaks the sagamore shouted hawkeye answering the cry with his
own stentorian voice we have them now in face and back

the effect on the hurons was instantaneous discouraged by an assault
from a quarter that left them no opportunity for cover the warriors
uttered a common yell of disappointment and breaking off in a
body they spread themselves across the opening heedless of every
consideration but flight many fell in making the experiment under the
bullets and the blows of the pursuing delawares

we shall not pause to detail the meeting between the scout and
chingachgook or the more touching interview that duncan held with
munro a few brief and hurried words served to explain the state of
things to both parties and then hawkeye pointing out the sagamore to
his band resigned the chief authority into the hands of the mohican
chief chingachgook assumed the station to which his birth and
experience gave him so distinguished a claim with the grave dignity
that always gives force to the mandates of a native warrior following
the footsteps of the scout he led the party back through the thicket
his men scalping the fallen hurons and secreting the bodies of their own
dead as they proceeded until they gained a point where the former was
content to make a halt

the warriors who had breathed themselves freely in the preceding
struggle were now posted on a bit of level ground sprinkled with
trees in sufficient numbers to conceal them the land fell away rather
precipitately in front and beneath their eyes stretched for several
miles a narrow dark and wooded vale it was through this dense and
dark forest that uncas was still contending with the main body of the
hurons

the mohican and his friends advanced to the brow of the hill and
listened with practised ears to the sounds of the combat a few
birds hovered over the leafy bosom of the valley frightened from their
secluded nests and here and there a light vapory cloud which seemed
already blending with the atmosphere arose above the trees and
indicated some spot where the struggle had been fierce and stationary

the fight is coming up the ascent said duncan pointing in the
direction of a new explosion of firearms we are too much in the center
of their line to be effective

they will incline into the hollow where the cover is thicker said
the scout and that will leave us well on their flank go sagamore
you will hardly be in time to give the whoop and lead on the young men
i will fight this scrimmage with warriors of my own color you know me
mohican not a huron of them all shall cross the swell into your rear
without the notice of killdeer

the indian chief paused another moment to consider the signs of the
contest which was now rolling rapidly up the ascent a certain evidence
that the delawares triumphed nor did he actually quit the place until
admonished of the proximity of his friends as well as enemies by the
bullets of the former which began to patter among the dried leaves on
the ground like the bits of falling hail which precede the bursting of
the tempest hawkeye and his three companions withdrew a few paces to
a shelter and awaited the issue with calmness that nothing but great
practise could impart in such a scene

it was not long before the reports of the rifles began to lose the
echoes of the woods and to sound like weapons discharged in the open
air then a warrior appeared here and there driven to the skirts of
the forest and rallying as he entered the clearing as at the place
where the final stand was to be made these were soon joined by others
until a long line of swarthy figures was to be seen clinging to
the cover with the obstinacy of desperation heyward began to
grow impatient and turned his eyes anxiously in the direction of
chingachgook the chief was seated on a rock with nothing visible but
his calm visage considering the spectacle with an eye as deliberate as
if he were posted there merely to view the struggle

the time has come for the delaware to strike said duncan

not so not so returned the scout when he scents his friends he
will let them know that he is here see see the knaves are getting in
that clump of pines like bees settling after their flight by the
lord a squaw might put a bullet into the center of such a knot of dark
skins

at that instant the whoop was given and a dozen hurons fell by a
discharge from chingachgook and his band the shout that followed was
answered by a single war-cry from the forest and a yell passed through
the air that sounded as if a thousand throats were united in a common
effort the hurons staggered deserting the center of their line and
uncas issued from the forest through the opening they left at the head
of a hundred warriors

waving his hands right and left the young chief pointed out the enemy
to his followers who separated in pursuit the war now divided both
wings of the broken hurons seeking protection in the woods again hotly
pressed by the victorious warriors of the lenape a minute might have
passed but the sounds were already receding in different directions
and gradually losing their distinctness beneath the echoing arches of
the woods one little knot of hurons however had disdained to seek a
cover and were retiring like lions at bay slowly and sullenly up the
acclivity which chingachgook and his band had just deserted to mingle
more closely in the fray magua was conspicuous in this party both by
his fierce and savage mien and by the air of haughty authority he yet
maintained

in his eagerness to expedite the pursuit uncas had left himself nearly
alone but the moment his eye caught the figure of le subtil every
other consideration was forgotten raising his cry of battle which
recalled some six or seven warriors and reckless of the disparity of
their numbers he rushed upon his enemy le renard who watched the
movement paused to receive him with secret joy but at the moment when
he thought the rashness of his impetuous young assailant had left him
at his mercy another shout was given and la longue carabine was seen
rushing to the rescue attended by all his white associates the huron
instantly turned and commenced a rapid retreat up the ascent

there was no time for greetings or congratulations for uncas though
unconscious of the presence of his friends continued the pursuit with
the velocity of the wind in vain hawkeye called to him to respect the
covers the young mohican braved the dangerous fire of his enemies and
soon compelled them to a flight as swift as his own headlong speed it
was fortunate that the race was of short continuance and that the white
men were much favored by their position or the delaware would soon have
outstripped all his companions and fallen a victim to his own temerity
but ere such a calamity could happen the pursuers and pursued entered
the wyandot village within striking distance of each other

excited by the presence of their dwellings and tired of the chase the
hurons now made a stand and fought around their council-lodge with
the fury of despair the onset and the issue were like the passage and
destruction of a whirlwind the tomahawk of uncas the blows of hawkeye
and even the still nervous arm of munro were all busy for that passing
moment and the ground was quickly strewed with their enemies still
magua though daring and much exposed escaped from every effort against
his life with that sort of fabled protection that was made to overlook
the fortunes of favored heroes in the legends of ancient poetry raising
a yell that spoke volumes of anger and disappointment the subtle chief
when he saw his comrades fallen darted away from the place attended
by his two only surviving friends leaving the delawares engaged in
stripping the dead of the bloody trophies of their victory

but uncas who had vainly sought him in the melee bounded forward in
pursuit hawkeye heyward and david still pressing on his footsteps the
utmost that the scout could effect was to keep the muzzle of his rifle
a little in advance of his friend to whom however it answered every
purpose of a charmed shield once magua appeared disposed to make
another and a final effort to revenge his losses but abandoning his
intention as soon as demonstrated he leaped into a thicket of bushes
through which he was followed by his enemies and suddenly entered the
mouth of the cave already known to the reader hawkeye who had only
forborne to fire in tenderness to uncas raised a shout of success and
proclaimed aloud that now they were certain of their game the pursuers
dashed into the long and narrow entrance in time to catch a glimpse of
the retreating forms of the hurons their passage through the natural
galleries and subterraneous apartments of the cavern was preceded by the
shrieks and cries of hundreds of women and children the place seen by
its dim and uncertain light appeared like the shades of the infernal
regions across which unhappy ghosts and savage demons were flitting in
multitudes

still uncas kept his eye on magua as if life to him possessed but
a single object heyward and the scout still pressed on his rear
actuated though possibly in a less degree by a common feeling but
their way was becoming intricate in those dark and gloomy passages and
the glimpses of the retiring warriors less distinct and frequent and
for a moment the trace was believed to be lost when a white robe was
seen fluttering in the further extremity of a passage that seemed to
lead up the mountain

tis cora exclaimed heyward in a voice in which horror and delight
were wildly mingled

cora cora echoed uncas bounding forward like a deer

tis the maiden shouted the scout courage lady we come we come

the chase was renewed with a diligence rendered tenfold encouraging
by this glimpse of the captive but the way was rugged broken and in
spots nearly impassable uncas abandoned his rifle and leaped forward
with headlong precipitation heyward rashly imitated his example though
both were a moment afterward admonished of his madness by hearing the
bellowing of a piece that the hurons found time to discharge down the
passage in the rocks the bullet from which even gave the young mohican
a slight wound

we must close said the scout passing his friends by a desperate
leap the knaves will pick us all off at this distance and see they
hold the maiden so as to shield themselves

though his words were unheeded or rather unheard his example was
followed by his companions who by incredible exertions got near
enough to the fugitives to perceive that cora was borne along between
the two warriors while magua prescribed the direction and manner of
their flight at this moment the forms of all four were strongly drawn
against an opening in the sky and they disappeared nearly frantic with
disappointment uncas and heyward increased efforts that already seemed
superhuman and they issued from the cavern on the side of the mountain
in time to note the route of the pursued the course lay up the ascent
and still continued hazardous and laborious

encumbered by his rifle and perhaps not sustained by so deep an
interest in the captive as his companions the scout suffered the latter
to precede him a little uncas in his turn taking the lead of heyward
in this manner rocks precipices and difficulties were surmounted in
an incredibly short space that at another time and under other
circumstances would have been deemed almost insuperable but the
impetuous young men were rewarded by finding that encumbered with cora
the hurons were losing ground in the race

stay dog of the wyandots exclaimed uncas shaking his bright
tomahawk at magua a delaware girl calls stay

i will go no further cried cora stopping unexpectedly on a ledge
of rock that overhung a deep precipice at no great distance from the
summit of the mountain kill me if thou wilt detestable huron i will
go no further

the supporters of the maiden raised their ready tomahawks with the
impious joy that fiends are thought to take in mischief but magua
stayed the uplifted arms the huron chief after casting the weapons
he had wrested from his companions over the rock drew his knife
and turned to his captive with a look in which conflicting passions
fiercely contended

woman he said chose the wigwam or the knife of le subtil

cora regarded him not but dropping on her knees she raised her eyes
and stretched her arms toward heaven saying in a meek and yet confiding
voice

i am thine do with me as thou seest best

woman repeated magua hoarsely and endeavoring in vain to catch a
glance from her serene and beaming eye choose

but cora neither heard nor heeded his demand the form of the huron
trembled in every fibre and he raised his arm on high but dropped
it again with a bewildered air like one who doubted once more he
struggled with himself and lifted the keen weapon again but just then
a piercing cry was heard above them and uncas appeared leaping
frantically from a fearful height upon the ledge magua recoiled a
step and one of his assistants profiting by the chance sheathed his
own knife in the bosom of cora

the huron sprang like a tiger on his offending and already retreating
country man but the falling form of uncas separated the unnatural
combatants diverted from his object by this interruption and maddened
by the murder he had just witnessed magua buried his weapon in the back
of the prostrate delaware uttering an unearthly shout as he committed
the dastardly deed but uncas arose from the blow as the wounded
panther turns upon his foe and struck the murderer of cora to his feet
by an effort in which the last of his failing strength was expended
then with a stern and steady look he turned to le subtil and
indicated by the expression of his eye all that he would do had not
the power deserted him the latter seized the nerveless arm of the
unresisting delaware and passed his knife into his bosom three several
times before his victim still keeping his gaze riveted on his enemy
with a look of inextinguishable scorn fell dead at his feet

mercy mercy huron cried heyward from above in tones nearly choked
by horror give mercy and thou shalt receive from it

whirling the bloody knife up at the imploring youth the victorious
magua uttered a cry so fierce so wild and yet so joyous that it
conveyed the sounds of savage triumph to the ears of those who fought in
the valley a thousand feet below he was answered by a burst from the
lips of the scout whose tall person was just then seen moving swiftly
toward him along those dangerous crags with steps as bold and reckless
as if he possessed the power to move in air but when the hunter reached
the scene of the ruthless massacre the ledge was tenanted only by the
dead

his keen eye took a single look at the victims and then shot its
glances over the difficulties of the ascent in his front a form stood
at the brow of the mountain on the very edge of the giddy height
with uplifted arms in an awful attitude of menace without stopping to
consider his person the rifle of hawkeye was raised but a rock which
fell on the head of one of the fugitives below exposed the indignant
and glowing countenance of the honest gamut then magua issued from a
crevice and stepping with calm indifference over the body of the last
of his associates he leaped a wide fissure and ascended the rocks at
a point where the arm of david could not reach him a single bound would
carry him to the brow of the precipice and assure his safety before
taking the leap however the huron paused and shaking his hand at the
scout he shouted

the pale faces are dogs the delawares women magua leaves them on the
rocks for the crows

laughing hoarsely he made a desperate leap and fell short of his mark
though his hands grasped a shrub on the verge of the height the form
of hawkeye had crouched like a beast about to take its spring and
his frame trembled so violently with eagerness that the muzzle of the
half-raised rifle played like a leaf fluttering in the wind without
exhausting himself with fruitless efforts the cunning magua suffered
his body to drop to the length of his arms and found a fragment for his
feet to rest on then summoning all his powers he renewed the attempt
and so far succeeded as to draw his knees on the edge of the mountain
it was now when the body of his enemy was most collected together
that the agitated weapon of the scout was drawn to his shoulder the
surrounding rocks themselves were not steadier than the piece became
for the single instant that it poured out its contents the arms of the
huron relaxed and his body fell back a little while his knees still
kept their position turning a relentless look on his enemy he shook
a hand in grim defiance but his hold loosened and his dark person was
seen cutting the air with its head downward for a fleeting instant
until it glided past the fringe of shrubbery which clung to the
mountain in its rapid flight to destruction




chapter 

 they fought like brave men long and well
 they piled that ground with moslem slain
 they conquered but bozzaris fell
 bleeding at every vein
 his few surviving comrades saw
 his smile when rang their loud hurrah
 and the red field was won
 then saw in death his eyelids close
 calmly as to a night's repose
 like flowers at set of sun
 halleck

the sun found the lenape on the succeeding day a nation of mourners
the sounds of the battle were over and they had fed fat their ancient
grudge and had avenged their recent quarrel with the mengwe by the
destruction of a whole community the black and murky atmosphere that
floated around the spot where the hurons had encamped sufficiently
announced of itself the fate of that wandering tribe while hundreds of
ravens that struggled above the summits of the mountains or swept in
noisy flocks across the wide ranges of the woods furnished a frightful
direction to the scene of the combat in short any eye at all practised
in the signs of a frontier warfare might easily have traced all those
unerring evidences of the ruthless results which attend an indian
vengeance

still the sun rose on the lenape a nation of mourners no shouts
of success no songs of triumph were heard in rejoicings for their
victory the latest straggler had returned from his fell employment
only to strip himself of the terrific emblems of his bloody calling
and to join in the lamentations of his countrymen as a stricken people
pride and exultation were supplanted by humility and the fiercest
of human passions was already succeeded by the most profound and
unequivocal demonstrations of grief

the lodges were deserted but a broad belt of earnest faces encircled a
spot in their vicinity whither everything possessing life had repaired
and where all were now collected in deep and awful silence though
beings of every rank and age of both sexes and of all pursuits had
united to form this breathing wall of bodies they were influenced by a
single emotion each eye was riveted on the center of that ring which
contained the objects of so much and of so common an interest

six delaware girls with their long dark flowing tresses falling
loosely across their bosoms stood apart and only gave proof of their
existence as they occasionally strewed sweet-scented herbs and forest
flowers on a litter of fragrant plants that under a pall of indian
robes supported all that now remained of the ardent high-souled
and generous cora her form was concealed in many wrappers of the same
simple manufacture and her face was shut forever from the gaze of
men at her feet was seated the desolate munro his aged head was
bowed nearly to the earth in compelled submission to the stroke of
providence but a hidden anguish struggled about his furrowed brow
that was only partially concealed by the careless locks of gray that
had fallen neglected on his temples gamut stood at his side his
meek head bared to the rays of the sun while his eyes wandering and
concerned seemed to be equally divided between that little volume
which contained so many quaint but holy maxims and the being in whose
behalf his soul yearned to administer consolation heyward was also
nigh supporting himself against a tree and endeavoring to keep down
those sudden risings of sorrow that it required his utmost manhood to
subdue

but sad and melancholy as this group may easily be imagined it was far
less touching than another that occupied the opposite space of the same
area seated as in life with his form and limbs arranged in grave and
decent composure uncas appeared arrayed in the most gorgeous ornaments
that the wealth of the tribe could furnish rich plumes nodded above
his head wampum gorgets bracelets and medals adorned his person
in profusion though his dull eye and vacant lineaments too strongly
contradicted the idle tale of pride they would convey

directly in front of the corpse chingachgook was placed without arms
paint or adornment of any sort except the bright blue blazonry of his
race that was indelibly impressed on his naked bosom during the long
period that the tribe had thus been collected the mohican warrior had
kept a steady anxious look on the cold and senseless countenance of his
son so riveted and intense had been that gaze and so changeless his
attitude that a stranger might not have told the living from the dead
but for the occasional gleamings of a troubled spirit that shot athwart
the dark visage of one and the deathlike calm that had forever settled
on the lineaments of the other the scout was hard by leaning in a
pensive posture on his own fatal and avenging weapon while tamenund
supported by the elders of his nation occupied a high place at hand
whence he might look down on the mute and sorrowful assemblage of his
people

just within the inner edge of the circle stood a soldier in the
military attire of a strange nation and without it was his warhorse in
the center of a collection of mounted domestics seemingly in readiness
to undertake some distant journey the vestments of the stranger
announced him to be one who held a responsible situation near the person
of the captain of the canadas and who as it would now seem finding
his errand of peace frustrated by the fierce impetuosity of his allies
was content to become a silent and sad spectator of the fruits of a
contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate

the day was drawing to the close of its first quarter and yet had the
multitude maintained its breathing stillness since its dawn

no sound louder than a stifled sob had been heard among them nor had
even a limb been moved throughout that long and painful period except
to perform the simple and touching offerings that were made from time
to time in commemoration of the dead the patience and forbearance of
indian fortitude could alone support such an appearance of abstraction
as seemed now to have turned each dark and motionless figure into stone

at length the sage of the delawares stretched forth an arm and leaning
on the shoulders of his attendants he arose with an air as feeble as
if another age had already intervened between the man who had met his
nation the preceding day and him who now tottered on his elevated
stand

men of the lenape he said in low hollow tones that sounded like a
voice charged with some prophetic mission the face of the manitou
is behind a cloud his eye is turned from you his ears are shut his
tongue gives no answer you see him not yet his judgments are before
you let your hearts be open and your spirits tell no lie men of the
lenape the face of the manitou is behind a cloud

as this simple and yet terrible annunciation stole on the ears of the
multitude a stillness as deep and awful succeeded as if the venerated
spirit they worshiped had uttered the words without the aid of human
organs and even the inanimate uncas appeared a being of life compared
with the humbled and submissive throng by whom he was surrounded as the
immediate effect however gradually passed away a low murmur of voices
commenced a sort of chant in honor of the dead the sounds were those of
females and were thrillingly soft and wailing the words were connected
by no regular continuation but as one ceased another took up the
eulogy or lamentation whichever it might be called and gave vent to
her emotions in such language as was suggested by her feelings and the
occasion at intervals the speaker was interrupted by general and loud
bursts of sorrow during which the girls around the bier of cora plucked
the plants and flowers blindly from her body as if bewildered with
grief but in the milder moments of their plaint these emblems of
purity and sweetness were cast back to their places with every sign
of tenderness and regret though rendered less connected by many and
general interruptions and outbreakings a translation of their language
would have contained a regular descant which in substance might have
proved to possess a train of consecutive ideas

a girl selected for the task by her rank and qualifications
commenced by modest allusions to the qualities of the deceased warrior
embellishing her expressions with those oriental images that the
indians have probably brought with them from the extremes of the other
continent and which form of themselves a link to connect the ancient
histories of the two worlds she called him the panther of his tribe
and described him as one whose moccasin left no trail on the dews whose
bound was like the leap of a young fawn whose eye was brighter than
a star in the dark night and whose voice in battle was loud as the
thunder of the manitou she reminded him of the mother who bore him and
dwelt forcibly on the happiness she must feel in possessing such a son
she bade him tell her when they met in the world of spirits that the
delaware girls had shed tears above the grave of her child and had
called her blessed

then they who succeeded changing their tones to a milder and still
more tender strain alluded with the delicacy and sensitiveness of
women to the stranger maiden who had left the upper earth at a time
so near his own departure as to render the will of the great spirit too
manifest to be disregarded they admonished him to be kind to her and
to have consideration for her ignorance of those arts which were so
necessary to the comfort of a warrior like himself they dwelled upon
her matchless beauty and on her noble resolution without the taint of
envy and as angels may be thought to delight in a superior excellence
adding that these endowments should prove more than equivalent for any
little imperfection in her education

after which others again in due succession spoke to the maiden
herself in the low soft language of tenderness and love they exhorted
her to be of cheerful mind and to fear nothing for her future welfare
a hunter would be her companion who knew how to provide for her
smallest wants and a warrior was at her side who was able to protect
he against every danger they promised that her path should be pleasant
and her burden light they cautioned her against unavailing regrets for
the friends of her youth and the scenes where her father had dwelt
assuring her that the blessed hunting grounds of the lenape contained
vales as pleasant streams as pure and flowers as sweet as the heaven
of the pale faces they advised her to be attentive to the wants of her
companion and never to forget the distinction which the manitou had so
wisely established between them then in a wild burst of their chant
they sang with united voices the temper of the mohican's mind they
pronounced him noble manly and generous all that became a warrior and
all that a maid might love clothing their ideas in the most remote
and subtle images they betrayed that in the short period of their
intercourse they had discovered with the intuitive perception of their
sex the truant disposition of his inclinations the delaware girls had
found no favor in his eyes he was of a race that had once been lords on
the shores of the salt lake and his wishes had led him back to a
people who dwelt about the graves of his fathers why should not such
a predilection be encouraged that she was of a blood purer and richer
than the rest of her nation any eye might have seen that she was
equal to the dangers and daring of a life in the woods her conduct
had proved and now they added the wise one of the earth had
transplanted her to a place where she would find congenial spirits and
might be forever happy

then with another transition in voice and subject allusions were
made to the virgin who wept in the adjacent lodge they compared her to
flakes of snow as pure as white as brilliant and as liable to melt
in the fierce heats of summer or congeal in the frosts of winter they
doubted not that she was lovely in the eyes of the young chief whose
skin and whose sorrow seemed so like her own but though far from
expressing such a preference it was evident they deemed her less
excellent than the maid they mourned still they denied her no need
her rare charms might properly claim her ringlets were compared to the
exuberant tendrils of the vine her eye to the blue vault of heavens
and the most spotless cloud with its glowing flush of the sun was
admitted to be less attractive than her bloom

during these and similar songs nothing was audible but the murmurs of
the music relieved as it was or rather rendered terrible by those
occasional bursts of grief which might be called its choruses the
delawares themselves listened like charmed men and it was very
apparent by the variations of their speaking countenances how deep and
true was their sympathy even david was not reluctant to lend his ears
to the tones of voices so sweet and long ere the chant was ended his
gaze announced that his soul was enthralled

the scout to whom alone of all the white men the words were
intelligible suffered himself to be a little aroused from his
meditative posture and bent his face aside to catch their meaning as
the girls proceeded but when they spoke of the future prospects of
cora and uncas he shook his head like one who knew the error of their
simple creed and resuming his reclining attitude he maintained it
until the ceremony if that might be called a ceremony in which feeling
was so deeply imbued was finished happily for the self-command of both
heyward and munro they knew not the meaning of the wild sounds they
heard

chingachgook was a solitary exception to the interest manifested by the
native part of the audience his look never changed throughout the whole
of the scene nor did a muscle move in his rigid countenance even at
the wildest or the most pathetic parts of the lamentation the cold and
senseless remains of his son was all to him and every other sense but
that of sight seemed frozen in order that his eyes might take their
final gaze at those lineaments he had so long loved and which were now
about to be closed forever from his view

in this stage of the obsequies a warrior much renowned for deed in
arms and more especially for services in the recent combat a man of
stern and grave demeanor advanced slowly from the crowd and placed
himself nigh the person of the dead

why hast thou left us pride of the wapanachki he said addressing
himself to the dull ears of uncas as if the empty clay retained the
faculties of the animated man thy time has been like that of the sun
when in the trees thy glory brighter than his light at noonday thou
art gone youthful warrior but a hundred wyandots are clearing the
briers from thy path to the world of the spirits who that saw thee in
battle would believe that thou couldst die who before thee has ever
shown uttawa the way into the fight thy feet were like the wings of
eagles thine arm heavier than falling branches from the pine and
thy voice like the manitou when he speaks in the clouds the tongue of
uttawa is weak he added looking about him with a melancholy gaze
and his heart exceeding heavy pride of the wapanachki why hast thou
left us

he was succeeded by others in due order until most of the high and
gifted men of the nation had sung or spoken their tribute of praise over
the manes of the deceased chief when each had ended another deep and
breathing silence reigned in all the place

then a low deep sound was heard like the suppressed accompaniment of
distant music rising just high enough on the air to be audible and
yet so indistinctly as to leave its character and the place whence it
proceeded alike matters of conjecture it was however succeeded by
another and another strain each in a higher key until they grew on the
ear first in long drawn and often repeated interjections and finally
in words the lips of chingachgook had so far parted as to announce
that it was the monody of the father though not an eye was turned
toward him nor the smallest sign of impatience exhibited it was
apparent by the manner in which the multitude elevated their heads to
listen that they drank in the sounds with an intenseness of attention
that none but tamenund himself had ever before commanded but
they listened in vain the strains rose just so loud as to become
intelligible and then grew fainter and more trembling until they
finally sank on the ear as if borne away by a passing breath of wind
the lips of the sagamore closed and he remained silent in his seat
looking with his riveted eye and motionless form like some creature
that had been turned from the almighty hand with the form but without
the spirit of a man the delawares who knew by these symptoms that
the mind of their friend was not prepared for so mighty an effort of
fortitude relaxed in their attention and with an innate delicacy
seemed to bestow all their thoughts on the obsequies of the stranger
maiden

a signal was given by one of the elder chiefs to the women who crowded
that part of the circle near which the body of cora lay obedient to
the sign the girls raised the bier to the elevation of their heads
and advanced with slow and regulated steps chanting as they proceeded
another wailing song in praise of the deceased gamut who had been a
close observer of rites he deemed so heathenish now bent his head over
the shoulder of the unconscious father whispering

they move with the remains of thy child shall we not follow and see
them interred with christian burial

munro started as if the last trumpet had sounded in his ear and
bestowing one anxious and hurried glance around him he arose and
followed in the simple train with the mien of a soldier but bearing
the full burden of a parent's suffering his friends pressed around him
with a sorrow that was too strong to be termed sympathy even the young
frenchman joining in the procession with the air of a man who was
sensibly touched at the early and melancholy fate of one so lovely but
when the last and humblest female of the tribe had joined in the wild
and yet ordered array the men of the lenape contracted their circle
and formed again around the person of uncas as silent as grave and as
motionless as before

the place which had been chosen for the grave of cora was a little
knoll where a cluster of young and healthful pines had taken root
forming of themselves a melancholy and appropriate shade over the spot
on reaching it the girls deposited their burden and continued for many
minutes waiting with characteristic patience and native timidity for
some evidence that they whose feelings were most concerned were content
with the arrangement at length the scout who alone understood their
habits said in their own language

my daughters have done well the white men thank them

satisfied with this testimony in their favor the girls proceeded
to deposit the body in a shell ingeniously and not inelegantly
fabricated of the bark of the birch after which they lowered it into
its dark and final abode the ceremony of covering the remains and
concealing the marks of the fresh earth by leaves and other natural and
customary objects was conducted with the same simple and silent forms
but when the labors of the kind beings who had performed these sad and
friendly offices were so far completed they hesitated in a way to show
that they knew not how much further they might proceed it was in this
stage of the rites that the scout again addressed them

my young women have done enough he said the spirit of the pale
face has no need of food or raiment their gifts being according to the
heaven of their color i see he added glancing an eye at david who
was preparing his book in a manner that indicated an intention to
lead the way in sacred song that one who better knows the christian
fashions is about to speak

the females stood modestly aside and from having been the principal
actors in the scene they now became the meek and attentive observers of
that which followed during the time david occupied in pouring out the
pious feelings of his spirit in this manner not a sign of surprise nor
a look of impatience escaped them they listened like those who knew
the meaning of the strange words and appeared as if they felt the
mingled emotions of sorrow hope and resignation they were intended to
convey

excited by the scene he had just witnessed and perhaps influenced by
his own secret emotions the master of song exceeded his usual efforts
his full rich voice was not found to suffer by a comparison with the
soft tones of the girls and his more modulated strains possessed at
least for the ears of those to whom they were peculiarly addressed
the additional power of intelligence he ended the anthem as he had
commenced it in the midst of a grave and solemn stillness

when however the closing cadence had fallen on the ears of his
auditors the secret timorous glances of the eyes and the general
and yet subdued movement of the assemblage betrayed that something was
expected from the father of the deceased munro seemed sensible that the
time was come for him to exert what is perhaps the greatest effort
of which human nature is capable he bared his gray locks and looked
around the timid and quiet throng by which he was encircled with a firm
and collected countenance then motioning with his hand for the scout
to listen he said

say to these kind and gentle females that a heart-broken and failing
man returns them his thanks tell them that the being we all worship
under different names will be mindful of their charity and that the
time shall not be distant when we may assemble around his throne without
distinction of sex or rank or color

the scout listened to the tremulous voice in which the veteran delivered
these words and shook his head slowly when they were ended as one who
doubted their efficacy

to tell them this he said would be to tell them that the snows come
not in the winter or that the sun shines fiercest when the trees are
stripped of their leaves

then turning to the women he made such a communication of the other's
gratitude as he deemed most suited to the capacities of his listeners
the head of munro had already sunk upon his chest and he was again
fast relapsing into melancholy when the young frenchman before named
ventured to touch him lightly on the elbow as soon as he had gained the
attention of the mourning old man he pointed toward a group of young
indians who approached with a light but closely covered litter and
then pointed upward toward the sun

i understand you sir returned munro with a voice of forced
firmness i understand you it is the will of heaven and i submit
cora my child if the prayers of a heart-broken father could avail thee
now how blessed shouldst thou be come gentlemen he added looking
about him with an air of lofty composure though the anguish that
quivered in his faded countenance was far too powerful to be concealed
our duty here is ended let us depart

heyward gladly obeyed a summons that took them from a spot where each
instant he felt his self-control was about to desert him while his
companions were mounting however he found time to press the hand of
the scout and to repeat the terms of an engagement they had made to
meet again within the posts of the british army then gladly throwing
himself into the saddle he spurred his charger to the side of the
litter whence low and stifled sobs alone announced the presence of
alice in this manner the head of munro again drooping on his bosom
with heyward and david following in sorrowing silence and attended
by the aide of montcalm with his guard all the white men with the
exception of hawkeye passed from before the eyes of the delawares and
were buried in the vast forests of that region

but the tie which through their common calamity had united the
feelings of these simple dwellers in the woods with the strangers who
had thus transiently visited them was not so easily broken years
passed away before the traditionary tale of the white maiden and of
the young warrior of the mohicans ceased to beguile the long nights and
tedious marches or to animate their youthful and brave with a desire
for vengeance neither were the secondary actors in these momentous
incidents forgotten through the medium of the scout who served for
years afterward as a link between them and civilized life they learned
in answer to their inquiries that the gray head was speedily gathered
to his fathers borne down as was erroneously believed by his military
misfortunes and that the open hand had conveyed his surviving
daughter far into the settlements of the pale faces where her tears
had at last ceased to flow and had been succeeded by the bright smiles
which were better suited to her joyous nature

but these were events of a time later than that which concerns our tale
deserted by all of his color hawkeye returned to the spot where his
sympathies led him with a force that no ideal bond of union could
destroy he was just in time to catch a parting look of the features of
uncas whom the delawares were already inclosing in his last vestment
of skins they paused to permit the longing and lingering gaze of the
sturdy woodsman and when it was ended the body was enveloped never to
be unclosed again then came a procession like the other and the whole
nation was collected about the temporary grave of the chief temporary
because it was proper that at some future day his bones should rest
among those of his own people

the movement like the feeling had been simultaneous and general the
same grave expression of grief the same rigid silence and the same
deference to the principal mourner were observed around the place of
interment as have been already described the body was deposited in an
attitude of repose facing the rising sun with the implements of war
and of the chase at hand in readiness for the final journey an opening
was left in the shell by which it was protected from the soil for the
spirit to communicate with its earthly tenement when necessary and the
whole was concealed from the instinct and protected from the ravages
of the beasts of prey with an ingenuity peculiar to the natives the
manual rites then ceased and all present reverted to the more spiritual
part of the ceremonies

chingachgook became once more the object of the common attention he had
not yet spoken and something consolatory and instructive was expected
from so renowned a chief on an occasion of such interest conscious of
the wishes of the people the stern and self-restrained warrior raised
his face which had latterly been buried in his robe and looked about
him with a steady eye his firmly compressed and expressive lips then
severed and for the first time during the long ceremonies his voice was
distinctly audible why do my brothers mourn he said regarding the
dark race of dejected warriors by whom he was environed why do my
daughters weep that a young man has gone to the happy hunting-grounds
that a chief has filled his time with honor he was good he was
dutiful he was brave who can deny it the manitou had need of such a
warrior and he has called him away as for me the son and the father
of uncas i am a blazed pine in a clearing of the pale faces my
race has gone from the shores of the salt lake and the hills of the
delawares but who can say that the serpent of his tribe has forgotten
his wisdom i am alone 

no no cried hawkeye who had been gazing with a yearning look at the
rigid features of his friend with something like his own self-command
but whose philosophy could endure no longer no sagamore not alone
the gifts of our colors may be different but god has so placed us as to
journey in the same path i have no kin and i may also say like you
no people he was your son and a red-skin by nature and it may be that
your blood was nearer but if ever i forget the lad who has so often
fou't at my side in war and slept at my side in peace may he who made
us all whatever may be our color or our gifts forget me the boy has
left us for a time but sagamore you are not alone

chingachgook grasped the hand that in the warmth of feeling the scout
had stretched across the fresh earth and in an attitude of friendship
these two sturdy and intrepid woodsmen bowed their heads together while
scalding tears fell to their feet watering the grave of uncas like
drops of falling rain

in the midst of the awful stillness with which such a burst of feeling
coming as it did from the two most renowned warriors of that region
was received tamenund lifted his voice to disperse the multitude

it is enough he said go children of the lenape the anger of
the manitou is not done why should tamenund stay the pale faces are
masters of the earth and the time of the red men has not yet come
again my day has been too long in the morning i saw the sons of unamis
happy and strong and yet before the night has come have i lived to
see the last warrior of the wise race of the mohicans

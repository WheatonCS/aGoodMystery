the world for that but
well-a-day we hear a shrill voice of affliction the scream of a
little child rising louder with every repetition of that smart
sharp slapping sound produced by an open hand on tender flesh annie
sympathizes though without experience of such direful woe

lo the town-crier again with some new secret for the public ear
will he tell us of an auction or of a lost pocket-book or a show of
beautiful wax figures or of some monstrous beast more horrible than
any in the caravan i guess the latter see how he uplifts the bell in
his right hand and shakes it slowly at first then with a hurried
motion till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once and the
sounds are scattered forth in quick succession far and near

ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong

now he raises his clear loud voice above all the din of the town it
drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues and draws each man's mind from
his own business it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends
to the hushed chamber of the sick and penetrates downward to the
cellar kitchen where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen who
of all that address the public ear whether in church or court-house
or hall of state has such an attentive audience as the town-crier
what saith the people's orator

strayed from her home a little girl of five years old in a blue
silk frock and white pantalets with brown curling hair and hazel
eyes whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother 

stop stop town-crier the lost is found oh my pretty annie we
forgot to tell your mother of our ramble and she is in despair and
has sent the town-crier to bellow up and down the streets affrighting
old and young for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go
my hand well let us hasten homeward and as we go forget not to
thank heaven my annie that after wandering a little way into the
world you may return at the first summons with an untainted and
unwearied heart and be a happy child again but i have gone too far
astray for the town-crier to call me back

sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit throughout my
ramble with little annie say not that it has been a waste of precious
moments an idle matter a babble of childish talk and a reverie of
childish imaginations about topics unworthy of a grown man's notice
has it been merely this not so not so they are not truly wise who
would affirm it as the pure breath of children revives the life of
aged men so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple
thoughts their native feeling their airy mirth for little cause or
none their grief soon roused and soon allayed their influence on us
is at least reciprocal with ours on them when our infancy is almost
forgotten and our boyhood long departed though it seems but as
yesterday when life settles darkly down upon us and we doubt whether
to call ourselves young any more then it is good to steal away from
the society of bearded men and even of gentler woman and spend an
hour or two with children after drinking from those fountains of
still fresh existence we shall return into the crowd as i do now to
struggle onward and do our part in life perhaps as fervently as ever
but for a time with a kinder and purer heart and a spirit more lightly
wise all this by thy sweet magic dear little annie




wakefield


in some old magazine or newspaper i recollect a story told as truth
of a man let us call him wakefield who absented himself for a long
time from his wife the fact thus abstractedly stated is not very
uncommon nor without a proper distinction of circumstances to be
condemned either as naughty or nonsensical howbeit this though far
from the most aggravated is perhaps the strangest instance on record
of marital delinquency and moreover as remarkable a freak as may be
found in the whole list of human oddities the wedded couple lived in
london the man under pretence of going a journey took lodgings in
the next street to his own house and there unheard of by his wife or
friends and without the shadow of a reason for such self-banishment
dwelt upward of twenty years during that period he beheld his home
every day and frequently the forlorn mrs wakefield and after so
great a gap in his matrimonial felicity when his death was reckoned
certain his estate settled his name dismissed from memory and his
wife long long ago resigned to her autumnal widowhood he entered the
door one evening quietly as from a day's absence and became a loving
spouse till death

this outline is all that i remember but the incident though of the
purest originality unexampled and probably never to be repeated is
one i think which appeals to the general sympathies of mankind we
know each for himself that none of us would perpetrate such a folly
yet feel as if some other might to my own contemplations at least
it has often recurred always exciting wonder but with a sense that
the story must be true and a conception of its hero's character
whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind time is well spent
in thinking of it if the reader choose let him do his own
meditation or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years
of wakefield's vagary i bid him welcome trusting that there will be
a pervading spirit and a moral even should we fail to find them done
up neatly and condensed into the final sentence thought has always
its efficacy and every striking incident its moral

what sort of a man was wakefield we are free to shape out our own
idea and call it by his name he was now in the meridian of life his
matrimonial affections never violent were sobered into a calm
habitual sentiment of all husbands he was likely to be the most
constant because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest
wherever it might be placed he was intellectual but not actively so
his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no
purpose or had not vigor to attain it his thoughts were seldom so
energetic as to seize hold of words imagination in the proper
meaning of the term made no part of wakefield's gifts with a cold
but not depraved nor wandering heart and a mind never feverish with
riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality who could have
anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place
among the doers of eccentric deeds had his acquaintances been asked
who was the man in london the surest to perform nothing to-day which
should be remembered on the morrow they would have thought of
wakefield only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated she
without having analyzed his character was partly aware of a quiet
selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mind of a peculiar sort
of vanity the most uneasy attribute about him of a disposition to
craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping
of petty secrets hardly worth revealing and lastly of what she
called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man this latter
quality is indefinable and perhaps non-existent

let us now imagine wakefield bidding adieu to his wife it is the dusk
of an october evening his equipment is a drab greatcoat a hat
covered with an oil-cloth top-boots an umbrella in one hand and a
small portmanteau in the other he has informed mrs wakefield that he
is to take the night-coach into the country she would fain inquire
the length of his journey its object and the probable time of his
return but indulgent to his harmless love of mystery interrogates
him only by a look he tells her not to expect him positively by the
return-coach nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days
but at all events to look for him at supper on friday evening
wakefield himself be it considered has no suspicion of what is
before him he holds out his hand she gives her own and meets his
parting kiss in the matter-of-course way of a ten years matrimony
and forth goes the middle-aged mr wakefield almost resolved to
perplex his good lady by a whole week's absence after the door has
closed behind him she perceives it thrust partly open and a vision of
her husband's face through the aperture smiling on her and gone in a
moment for the time this little incident is dismissed without a
thought but long afterward when she has been more years a widow than
a wife that smile recurs and flickers across all her reminiscences of
wakefield's visage in her many musings she surrounds the original
smile with a multitude of fantasies which make it strange and awful
as for instance if she imagines him in a coffin that parting look
is frozen on his pale features or if she dreams of him in heaven
still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile yet for its
sake when all others have given him up for dead she sometimes doubts
whether she is a widow

but our business is with the husband we must hurry after him along
the street ere he lose his individuality and melt into the great mass
of london life it would be vain searching for him there let us
follow close at his heels therefore until after several superfluous
turns and doublings we find him comfortably established by the
fireside of a small apartment previously bespoken he is in the next
street to his own and at his journey's end he can scarcely trust his
good-fortune in having got thither unperceived recollecting that at
one time he was delayed by the throng in the very focus of a lighted
lantern and again there were footsteps that seemed to tread behind
his own distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him and anon he
heard a voice shouting afar and fancied that it called his name
doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him and told his wife
the whole affair

poor wakefield little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this
great world no mortal eye but mine has traced thee go quietly to thy
bed foolish man and on the morrow if thou wilt be wise get thee
home to good mrs wakefield and tell her the truth remove not thyself
even for a little week from thy place in her chaste bosom were she
for a single moment to deem thee dead or lost or lastingly divided
from her thou wouldst be woefully conscious of a change in thy true
wife for ever after it is perilous to make a chasm in human
affections not that they gape so long and wide but so quickly close
again

almost repenting of his frolic or whatever it may be termed
wakefield lies down betimes and starting from his first nap spreads
forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed
bed no thinks he gathering the bedclothes about him i will not
sleep alone another night in the morning he rises earlier than usual
and sets himself to consider what he really means to do such are his
loose and rambling modes of thought that he has taken this very
singular step with the consciousness of a purpose indeed but without
being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation the
vagueness of the project and the convulsive effort with which he
plunges into the execution of it are equally characteristic of a
feeble-minded man wakefield sifts his ideas however as minutely as
he may and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at
home how his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week and
briefly how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances in which
he was a central object will be affected by his removal a morbid
vanity therefore lies nearest the bottom of the affair but how is
he to attain his ends not certainly by keeping close in this
comfortable lodging where though he slept and awoke in the next
street to his home he is as effectually abroad as if the stage-coach
had been whirling him away all night yet should he reappear the
whole project is knocked in the head his poor brains being hopelessly
puzzled with this dilemma he at length ventures out partly resolving
to cross the head of the street and send one hasty glance toward his
forsaken domicile habit for he is a man of habits takes him by the
hand and guides him wholly unaware to his own door where just at
the critical moment he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon
the step wakefield whither are you going

at that instant his fate was turning on the pivot little dreaming of
the doom to which his first backward step devotes him he hurries
away breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt and hardly dares turn
his head at the distant corner can it be that nobody caught sight of
him will not the whole household the decent mrs wakefield the
smart maid-servant and the dirty little footboy raise a hue-and-cry
through london streets in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master
wonderful escape he gathers courage to pause and look homeward but
is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice such as
affects us all when after a separation of months or years we again
see some hill or lake or work of art with which we were friends of
old in ordinary cases this indescribable impression is caused by the
comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the
reality in wakefield the magic of a single night has wrought a
similar transformation because in that brief period a great moral
change has been effected but this is a secret from himself before
leaving the spot he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife
passing athwart the front window with her face turned toward the head
of the street the crafty nincompoop takes to his heels scared with
the idea that among a thousand such atoms of mortality her eye must
have detected him right glad is his heart though his brain be
somewhat dizzy when he finds himself by the coal-fire of his
lodgings

so much for the commencement of this long whim-wham after the initial
conception and the stirring up of the man's sluggish temperament to
put it in practice the whole matter evolves itself in a natural
train we may suppose him as the result of deep deliberation buying
a new wig of reddish hair and selecting sundry garments in a fashion
unlike his customary suit of brown from a jew's old-clothes bag it
is accomplished wakefield is another man the new system being now
established a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as
difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position
furthermore he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally
incident to his temper and brought on at present by the inadequate
sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of
mrs wakefield he will not go back until she be frightened half to
death well twice or thrice has she passed before his sight each
time with a heavier step a paler cheek and more anxious brow and in
the third week of his non-appearance he detects a portent of evil
entering the house in the guise of an apothecary next day the knocker
is muffled toward nightfall comes the chariot of a physician and
deposits its big-wigged and solemn burden at wakefield's door whence
after a quarter of an hour's visit he emerges perchance the herald of
a funeral dear woman will she die

by this time wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling
but still lingers away from his wife's bedside pleading with his
conscience that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture if aught
else restrains him he does not know it in the course of a few weeks
she gradually recovers the crisis is over her heart is sad perhaps
but quiet and let him return soon or late it will never be feverish
for him again such ideas glimmer through the mist of wakefield's mind
and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf
divides his hired apartment from his former home it is but in the
next street he sometimes says fool it is in another world
hitherto he has put off his return from one particular day to
another henceforward he leaves the precise time undetermined not
to-morrow probably next week pretty soon poor man the dead have
nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the
self-banished wakefield

would that i had a folio to write instead of an article of a dozen
pages then might i exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays
its strong hand on every deed which we do and weaves its consequences
into an iron tissue of necessity

wakefield is spellbound we must leave him for ten years or so to
haunt around his house without once crossing the threshold and to be
faithful to his wife with all the affection of which his heart is
capable while he is slowly fading out of hers long since it must be
remarked he has lost the perception of singularity in his conduct

now for a scene amid the throng of a london street we distinguish a
man now waxing elderly with few characteristics to attract careless
observers yet bearing in his whole aspect the handwriting of no
common fate for such as have the skill to read it he is meagre his
low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled his eyes small and
lustreless sometimes wander apprehensively about him but oftener
seem to look inward he bends his head and moves with an indescribable
obliquity of gait as if unwilling to display his full front to the
world watch him long enough to see what we have described and you
will allow that circumstances which often produce remarkable men from
nature's ordinary handiwork have produced one such here next
leaving him to sidle along the footwalk cast your eyes in the
opposite direction where a portly female considerably in the wane of
life with a prayer-book in her hand is proceeding to yonder church
she has the placid mien of settled widowhood her regrets have either
died away or have become so essential to her heart that they would be
poorly exchanged for joy just as the lean man and well-conditioned
woman are passing a slight obstruction occurs and brings these two
figures directly in contact their hands touch the pressure of the
crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder they stand face to face
staring into each other's eyes after a ten years separation thus
wakefield meets his wife the throng eddies away and carries them
asunder the sober widow resuming her former pace proceeds to
church but pauses in the portal and throws a perplexed glance along
the street she passes in however opening her prayer-book as she
goes

and the man with so wild a face that busy and selfish london stands
to gaze after him he hurries to his lodgings bolts the door and
throws himself upon the bed the latent feelings of years break out
his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength all the
miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance and
he cries out passionately wakefield wakefield you are mad
perhaps he was so the singularity of his situation must have so
moulded him to itself that considered in regard to his
fellow-creatures and the business of life he could not be said to
possess his right mind he had contrived or rather he had
happened to dissever himself from the world to vanish to give up
his place and privileges with living men without being admitted among
the dead the life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his he was in
the bustle of the city as of old but the crowd swept by and saw him
not he was we may figuratively say always beside his wife and at
his hearth yet must never feel the warmth of the one nor the
affection of the other it was wakefield's unprecedented fate to
retain his original share of human sympathies and to be still involved
in human interests while he had lost his reciprocal influence on
them it would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect
of such circumstances on his heart and intellect separately and in
unison yet changed as he was he would seldom be conscious of it
but deem himself the same man as ever glimpses of the truth indeed
would come but only for the moment and still he would keep saying
i shall soon go back nor reflect that he had been saying so for
twenty years

i conceive also that these twenty years would appear in the
retrospect scarcely longer than the week to which wakefield had at
first limited his absence he would look on the affair as no more than
an interlude in the main business of his life when after a little
while more he should deem it time to re-enter his parlor his wife
would clap her hands for joy on beholding the middle-aged mr
wakefield alas what a mistake would time but await the close of our
favorite follies we should be young men all of us and till
doomsday

one evening in the twentieth year since he vanished wakefield is
taking his customary walk toward the dwelling which he still calls his
own it is a gusty night of autumn with frequent showers that patter
down upon the pavement and are gone before a man can put up his
umbrella pausing near the house wakefield discerns through the
parlor-windows of the second floor the red glow and the glimmer and
fitful flash of a comfortable fire on the ceiling appears a grotesque
shadow of good mrs wakefield the cap the nose and chin and the
broad waist form an admirable caricature which dances moreover with
the up-flickering and down-sinking blaze almost too merrily for the
shade of an elderly widow at this instant a shower chances to fall
and is driven by the unmannerly gust full into wakefield's face and
bosom he is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill shall he stand
wet and shivering here when his own hearth has a good fire to warm
him and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and small-clothes
which doubtless she has kept carefully in the closet of their
bedchamber no wakefield is no such fool he ascends the
steps heavily for twenty years have stiffened his legs since he came
down but he knows it not stay wakefield would you go to the sole
home that is left you then step into your grave the door opens as
he passes in we have a parting glimpse of his visage and recognize
the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he
has ever since been playing off at his wife's expense how
unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman well a good night's rest
to wakefield

this happy event supposing it to be such could only have occurred at
an unpremeditated moment we will not follow our friend across the
threshold he has left us much food for thought a portion of which
shall lend its wisdom to a moral and be shaped into a figure amid the
seeming confusion of our mysterious world individuals are so nicely
adjusted to a system and systems to one another and to a whole that
by stepping aside for a moment a man exposes himself to a fearful risk
of losing his place for ever like wakefield he may become as it
were the outcast of the universe




a rill from the town-pump


scene the corner of two principal streets the town-pump
talking through its nose


noon by the north clock noon by the east high noon too by these
hot sunbeams which full scarcely aslope upon my head and almost
make the water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose truly
we public characters have a tough time of it and among all the
town-officers chosen at march meeting where is he that sustains for a
single year the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed in
perpetuity upon the town-pump the title of town-treasurer is
rightfully mine as guardian of the best treasure that the town has
the overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman since i
provide bountifully for the pauper without expense to him that pays
taxes i am at the head of the fire department and one of the
physicians to the board of health as a keeper of the peace all
water-drinkers will confess me equal to the constable i perform some
of the duties of the town-clerk by promulgating public notices when
they are posted on my front to speak within bounds i am the chief
person of the municipality and exhibit moreover an admirable
pattern to my brother-officers by the cool steady upright downright
and impartial discharge of my business and the constancy with which i
stand to my post summer or winter nobody seeks me in vain for all
day long i am seen at the busiest corner just above the market
stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike and at night i hold a
lantern over my head both to show where i am and keep people out of
the gutters at this sultry noontide i am cupbearer to the parched
populace for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist
like a dramseller on the mall at muster-day i cry aloud to all and
sundry in my plainest accents and at the very tiptop of my voice

footnote essex and washington streets salem

here it is gentlemen here is the good liquor walk up walk up
gentlemen walk up walk up here is the superior stuff here is the
unadulterated ale of father adam better than cognac hollands
jamaica strong beer or wine of any price here it is by the hogshead
or the single glass and not a cent to pay walk up gentlemen walk

it were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers here they
come a hot day gentlemen quaff and away again so as to keep
yourselves in a nice cool sweat you my friend will need another
cupful to wash the dust out of your throat if it be as thick there as
it is on your cowhide shoes i see that you have trudged half a score
of miles to-day and like a wise man have passed by the taverns and
stopped at the running brooks and well-curbs otherwise betwixt heat
without and fire within you would have been burnt to a cinder or
melted down to nothing at all in the fashion of a jelly-fish drink
and make room for that other fellow who seeks my aid to quench the
fiery fever of last night's potations which he drained from no cup of
mine welcome most rubicund sir you and i have been great strangers
hitherto nor to confess the truth will my nose be anxious for a
closer intimacy till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent
mercy on you man the water absolutely hisses down your red-hot
gullet and is converted quite to steam in the miniature tophet which
you mistake for a stomach fill again and tell me on the word of an
honest toper did you ever in cellar tavern or any kind of a
dram-shop spend the price of your children's food for a swig half so
delicious now for the first time these ten years you know the
flavor of cold water good-bye and whenever you are thirsty remember
that i keep a constant supply at the old stand who next oh my
little friend you are let loose from school and come hither to scrub
your blooming face and drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule
and other schoolboy troubles in a draught from the town-pump take
it pure as the current of your young life take it and may your
heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than now
there my dear child put down the cup and yield your place to this
elderly gentleman who treads so tenderly over the paving-stones that i
suspect he is afraid of breaking them what he limps by without so
much as thanking me as if my hospitable offers were meant only for
people who have no wine-cellars well well sir no harm done i
hope go draw the cork tip the decanter but when your great toe
shall set you a-roaring it will be no affair of mine if gentlemen
love the pleasant titillation of the gout it is all one to the
town-pump this thirsty dog with his red tongue lolling out does not
scorn my hospitality but stands on his hind legs and laps eagerly out
of the trough see how lightly he capers away again jowler did your
worship ever have the gout

are you all satisfied then wipe your mouths my good friends and
while my spout has a moment's leisure i will delight the town with a
few historical remniscences in far antiquity beneath a darksome
shadow of venerable boughs a spring bubbled out of the leaf-strewn
earth in the very spot where you now behold me on the sunny pavement
the water was as bright and clear and deemed as precious as liquid
diamonds the indian sagamores drank of it from time immemorial till
the fatal deluge of the firewater burst upon the red men and swept
their whole race away from the cold fountains endicott and his
followers came next and often knelt down to drink dipping their long
beards in the spring the richest goblet then was of birch-bark
governor winthrop after a journey afoot from boston drank here out
of the hollow of his hand the elder higginson here wet his palm and
laid it on the brow of the first town-born child for many years it
was the watering-place and as it were the washbowl of the
vicinity whither all decent folks resorted to purify their visages
and gaze at them afterward at least the pretty maidens did in the
mirror which it made on sabbath-days whenever a babe was to be
baptized the sexton filled his basin here and placed it on the
communion-table of the humble meeting-house which partly covered the
site of yonder stately brick one thus one generation after another
was consecrated to heaven by its waters and cast their waxing and
waning shadows into its glassy bosom and vanished from the earth as
if mortal life were but a flitting image in a fountain finally the
fountain vanished also cellars were dug on all sides and cart-loads
of gravel flung upon its source whence oozed a turbid stream forming
a mud-puddle at the corner of two streets in the hot months when its
refreshment was most needed the dust flew in clouds over the
forgotten birthplace of the waters now their grave but in the course
of time a town-pump was sunk into the source of the ancient spring
and when the first decayed another took its place and then another
and still another till here stand i gentlemen and ladies to serve
you with my iron goblet drink and be refreshed the water is as pure
and cold as that which slaked the thirst of the red sagamore beneath
the aged boughs though now the gem of the wilderness is treasured
under these hot stones where no shadow falls but from the brick
buildings and be it the moral of my story that as this wasted and
long-lost fountain is now known and prized again so shall the virtues
of cold water too little valued since your fathers days be
recognized by all

your pardon good people i must interrupt my stream of eloquence and
spout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this
teamster and his two yoke of oxen who have come from topsfield or
somewhere along that way no part of my business is pleasanter than
the watering of cattle look how rapidly they lower the water-mark on
the sides of the trough till their capacious stomachs are moistened
with a gallon or two apiece and they can afford time to breathe it in
with sighs of calm enjoyment now they roll their quiet eyes around
the brim of their monstrous drinking-vessel an ox is your true toper

but i perceive my dear auditors that you are impatient for the
remainder of my discourse impute it i beseech you to no defect of
modesty if i insist a little longer on so fruitful a topic as my own
multifarious merits it is altogether for your good the better you
think of me the better men and women you will find yourselves i
shall say nothing of my all-important aid on washing-days though on
that account alone i might call myself the household god of a hundred
families far be it from me also to hint my respectable friends at
the show of dirty faces which you would present without my pains to
keep you clean nor will i remind you how often when the midnight
bells make you tremble for your combustible town you have fled to the
town-pump and found me always at my post firm amid the confusion and
ready to drain my vital current in your behalf neither is it worth
while to lay much stress on my claims to a medical diploma as the
physician whose simple rule of practice is preferable to all the
nauseous lore which has found men sick or left them so since the
days of hippocrates let us take a broader view of my beneficial
influence on mankind

no these are trifles compared with the merits which wise men concede
to me if not in my single self yet as the representative of a
class of being the grand reformer of the age from my spout and such
spouts as mine must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of
the vast portion of its crime and anguish which has gushed from the
fiery fountains of the still in this mighty enterprise the cow shall
be my great confederate milk and water the town-pump and the cow
such is the glorious copartnership that shall tear down the
distilleries and brewhouses uproot the vineyards shatter the
cider-presses ruin the tea and coffee trade and finally monopolize
the whole business of quenching thirst blessed consummation then
poverty shall pass away from the land finding no hovel so wretched
where her squalid form may shelter herself then disease for lack of
other victims shall gnaw its own heart and die then sin if she do
not die shall lose half her strength until now the frenzy of
hereditary fever has raged in the human blood transmitted from sire
to son and rekindled in every generation by fresh draughts of liquid
flame when that inward fire shall be extinguished the heat of
passion cannot but grow cool and war the drunkenness of
nations perhaps will cease at least there will be no war of
households the husband and wife drinking deep of peaceful joy a
calm bliss of temperate affections shall pass hand in hand through
life and lie down not reluctantly at its protracted close to them the
past will be no turmoil of mad dreams nor the future an eternity of
such moments as follow the delirium of the drunkard their dead faces
shall express what their spirits were and are to be by a lingering
smile of memory and hope

ahem dry work this speechifying especially to an unpractised
orator i never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers
undergo for my sake hereafter they shall have the business to
themselves do some kind christian pump a stroke or two just to
wet my whistle thank you sir my dear hearers when the world
shall have been regenerated by my instrumentality you will collect
your useless vats and liquor-casks into one great pile and make a
bonfire in honor of the town-pump and when i shall have decayed like
my predecessors then if you revere my memory let a marble fountain
richly sculptured take my place upon this spot such monuments should
be erected everywhere and inscribed with the names of the
distinguished champions of my cause now listen for something very
important is to come next

there are two or three honest friends of mine and true friends i know
they are who nevertheless by their fiery pugnacity in my behalf do
put me in fearful hazard of a broken nose or even a total overthrow
upon the pavement and the loss of the treasure which i guard i pray
you gentlemen let this fault be amended is it decent think you to
get tipsy with zeal for temperance and take up the honorable cause of
the town-pump in the style of a toper fighting for his brandy-bottle
or can the excellent qualities of cold water be no otherwise
exemplified than by plunging slapdash into hot water and woefully
scalding yourselves and other people trust me they may in the moral
warfare which you are to wage and indeed in the whole conduct of
your lives you cannot choose a better example than myself who have
never permitted the dust and sultry atmosphere the turbulence and
manifold disquietudes of the world around me to reach that deep calm
well of purity which may be called my soul and whenever i pour out
that soul it is to cool earth's fever or cleanse its stains

one o'clock nay then if the dinner-bell begins to speak i may as
well hold my peace here comes a pretty young girl of my acquaintance
with a large stone pitcher for me to fill may she draw a husband
while drawing her water as rachel did of old hold out your vessel
my dear there it is full to the brim so now run home peeping at
your sweet image in the pitcher as you go and forget not in a glass
of my own liquor to drink success to the town-pump




the great carbuncle

a mystery of the white mountains


at nightfall once in the olden time on the rugged side of one of the
crystal hills a party of adventurers were refreshing themselves after
a toilsome and fruitless quest for the great carbuncle they had come
thither not as friends nor partners in the enterprise but each save
one youthful pair impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing
for this wondrous gem their feeling of brotherhood however was
strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a
rude hut of branches and kindling a great fire of shattered pines that
had drifted down the headlong current of the amonoosuck on the lower
bank of which they were to pass the night there was but one of their
number perhaps who had become so estranged from natural sympathies
by the absorbing spell of the pursuit as to acknowledge no
satisfaction at the sight of human faces in the remote and solitary
region whither they had ascended a vast extent of wilderness lay
between them and the nearest settlement while scant a mile above
their heads was that bleak verge where the hills throw off their
shaggy mantle of forest-trees and either robe themselves in clouds or
tower naked into the sky the roar of the amonoosuck would have been
too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened while the
mountain-stream talked with the wind

footnote the indian tradition on which this somewhat extravagant
tale is founded is both too wild and too beautiful to be adequately
wrought up in prose sullivan in his history of maine written since
the revolution remarks that even then the existence of the great
carbuncle was not entirely discredited

the adventurers therefore exchanged hospitable greetings and
welcomed one another to the hut where each man was the host and all
were the guests of the whole company they spread their individual
supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock and partook of a
general repast at the close of which a sentiment of good-fellowship
was perceptible among the party though repressed by the idea that the
renewed search for the great carbuncle must make them strangers again
in the morning seven men and one young woman they warmed themselves
together at the fire which extended its bright wall along the whole
front of their wigwam as they observed the various and contrasted
figures that made up the assemblage each man looking like a
caricature of himself in the unsteady light that flickered over him
they came mutually to the conclusion that an odder society had never
met in city or wilderness on mountain or plain

the eldest of the group a tall lean weatherbeaten man some sixty
years of age was clad in the skins of wild animals whose fashion of
dress he did well to imitate since the deer the wolf and the bear
had long been his most intimate companions he was one of those
ill-fated mortals such as the indians told of whom in their early
youth the great carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness and became the
passionate dream of their existence all who visited that region knew
him as the seeker and by no other name as none could remember when
he first took up the search there went a fable in the valley of the
saco that for his inordinate lust after the great carbuncle he had
been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time
still with the same feverish hopes at sunrise the same despair at
eve near this miserable seeker sat a little elderly personage wearing
a high-crowned hat shaped somewhat like a crucible he was from beyond
the sea a doctor cacaphodel who had wilted and dried himself into a
mummy by continually stooping over charcoal-furnaces and inhaling
unwholesome fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy it
was told of him whether truly or not that at the commencement of his
studies he had drained his body of all its richest blood and wasted
it with other inestimable ingredients in an unsuccessful experiment
and had never been a well man since another of the adventurers was
master ichabod pigsnort a weighty merchant and selectman of boston
and an elder of the famous mr norton's church his enemies had a
ridiculous story that master pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole
hour after prayer-time every morning and evening in wallowing naked
among an immense quantity of pine-tree shillings which were the
earliest silver coinage of massachusetts the fourth whom we shall
notice had no name that his companions knew of and was chiefly
distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage and by
a prodigious pair of spectacles which were supposed to deform and
discolor the whole face of nature to this gentleman's perception the
fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name which was the greater pity
as he appeared to be a poet he was a bright-eyed man but woefully
pined away which was no more than natural if as some people
affirmed his ordinary diet was fog morning mist and a slice of the
densest cloud within his reach sauced with moonshine whenever he
could get it certain it is that the poetry which flowed from him had
a smack of all these dainties the sixth of the party was a young man
of haughty mien and sat somewhat apart from the rest wearing his
plumed hat loftily among his elders while the fire glittered on the
rich embroidery of his dress and gleamed intensely on the jewelled
pommel of his sword this was the lord de vere who when at home was
said to spend much of his time in the burial-vault of his dead
progenitors rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the
earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust so
that besides his own share he had the collected haughtiness of his
whole line of ancestry lastly there was a handsome youth in rustic
garb and by his side a blooming little person in whom a delicate
shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young
wife's affection her name was hannah and her husband's matthew two
homely names yet well enough adapted to the simple pair who seemed
strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had
been set agog by the great carbuncle

beneath the shelter of one hut in the bright blaze of the same fire
sat this varied group of adventurers all so intent upon a single
object that of whatever else they began to speak their closing words
were sure to be illuminated with the great carbuncle several related
the circumstances that brought them thither one had listened to a
traveller's tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country
and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as
could only be quenched in its intensest lustre another so long ago
as when the famous captain smith visited these coasts had seen it
blazing far at sea and had felt no rest in all the intervening years
till now that he took up the search a third being encamped on a
hunting-expedition full forty miles south of the white mountains
awoke at midnight and beheld the great carbuncle gleaming like a
meteor so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it they
spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the
spot and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success
from all adventurers though it might seem so easy to follow to its
source a light that overpowered the moon and almost matched the sun
it was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every
other in anticipating better fortune than the past yet nourished a
scarcely-hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one
as if to allay their too sanguine hopes they recurred to the indian
traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem and bewildered those
who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher
hills or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it
hung but these tales were deemed unworthy of credit all professing
to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or
perseverance in the adventurers or such other causes as might
naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the
intricacies of forest valley and mountain

in a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles
looked round upon the party making each individual in turn the object
of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance

so fellow-pilgrims said he here we are seven wise men and one
fair damsel who doubtless is as wise as any graybeard of the company
here we are i say all bound on the same goodly enterprise methinks
now it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do
with the great carbuncle provided he have the good hap to clutch
it what says our friend in the bearskin how mean you good sir to
enjoy the prize which you have been seeking the lord knows how long
among the crystal hills

how enjoy it exclaimed the aged seeker bitterly i hope for no
enjoyment from it that folly has past long ago i keep up the search
for this accursed stone because the vain ambition of my youth has
become a fate upon me in old age the pursuit alone is my strength
the energy of my soul the warmth of my blood and the pith and marrow
of my bones were i to turn my back upon it i should fall down dead
on the hither side of the notch which is the gateway of this
mountain-region yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would i
give up my hopes of is deemed little better than a traffic with the
evil one now think ye that i would have done this grievous wrong to
my soul body reputation and estate without a reasonable chance of
profit

not i pious master pigsnort said the man with the spectacles i
never laid such a great folly to thy charge

truly i hope not said the merchant now as touching this great
carbuncle i am free to own that i have never had a glimpse of it
but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell it will
surely outvalue the great mogul's best diamond which he holds at an
incalculable sum wherefore i am minded to put the great carbuncle on
shipboard and voyage with it to england france spain italy or into
heathendom if providence should send me thither and in a word
dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the
earth that he may place it among his crown-jewels if any of ye have
a wiser plan let him expound it

that have i thou sordid man exclaimed the poet dost thou desire
nothing brighter than gold that thou wouldst transmute all this
ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest in already for
myself hiding the jewel under my cloak i shall hie me back to my
attic-chamber in one of the darksome alleys of london there night and
day will i gaze upon it my soul shall drink its radiance it shall be
diffused throughout my intellectual powers and gleam brightly in every
line of poesy that i indite thus long ages after i am gone the
splendor of the great carbuncle will blaze around my name

well said master poet cried he of the spectacles hide it under
thy cloak sayest thou why it will gleam through the holes and make
thee look like a jack-o-lantern

to think ejaculated the lord de vere rather to himself than his
companions the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his
intercourse to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk
of conveying the great carbuncle to a garret in grubb street have not
i resolved within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter
ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle there shall it
flame for ages making a noonday of midnight glittering on the suits
of armor the banners and escutcheons that hang around the wall and
keeping bright the memory of heroes wherefore have all other
adventurers sought the prize in vain but that i might win it and make
it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line and never on the diadem
of the white mountains did the great carbuncle hold a place half so
honored as is reserved for it in the hall of the de veres

it is a noble thought said the cynic with an obsequious sneer
yet might i presume to say so the gem would make a rare sepulchral
lamp and would display the glories of your lordship's progenitors
more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle-hall

nay forsooth observed matthew the young rustic who sat hand in
hand with his bride the gentleman has bethought himself of a
profitable use for this bright stone hannah here and i are seeking it
for a like purpose

how fellow exclaimed his lordship in surprise what castle-hall
hast thou to hang it in

no castle replied matthew but as neat a cottage as any within
sight of the crystal hills ye must know friends that hannah and i
being wedded the last week have taken up the search of the great
carbuncle because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings
and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they
visit us it will shine through the house so that we may pick up a
pin in any corner and will set all the windows a-glowing as if there
were a great fire of pine-knots in the chimney and then how pleasant
when we awake in the night to be able to see one another's faces

there was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of
the young couple's project in regard to this wondrous and invaluable
stone with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud
to adorn his palace especially the man with spectacles who had
sneered at all the company in turn now twisted his visage into such
an expression of ill-natured mirth that matthew asked him rather
peevishly what he himself meant to do with the great carbuncle

the great carbuncle answered the cynic with ineffable scorn why
you blockhead there is no such thing in rerum naturâ i have
come three thousand miles and am resolved to set my foot on every
peak of these mountains and poke my head into every chasm for the sole
purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less
an ass than thyself that the great carbuncle is all a humbug

vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the
adventurers to the crystal hills but none so vain so foolish and so
impious too as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles he
was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to
the darkness instead of heavenward and who could they but extinguish
the lights which god hath kindled for us would count the midnight
gloom their chiefest glory

as the cynic spoke several of the party were startled by a gleam of
red splendor that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains
and the rock-bestrewn bed of the turbulent river with an illumination
unlike that of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the
forest-trees they listened for the roll of thunder but heard
nothing and were glad that the tempest came not near them the
stars those dial-points of heaven now warned the adventurers to
close their eyes on the blazing logs and open them in dreams to the
glow of the great carbuncle

the young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest
corner of the wigwam and were separated from the rest of the party by
a curtain of curiously-woven twigs such as might have hung in deep
festoons around the bridal-bower of eve the modest little wife had
wrought this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking
she and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped and awoke
from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more blessed light of
one another's eyes they awoke at the same instant and with one happy
smile beaming over their two faces which grew brighter with their
consciousness of the reality of life and love but no sooner did she
recollect where they were than the bride peeped through the
interstices of the leafy curtain and saw that the outer room of the
hut was deserted

up dear matthew cried she in haste the strange folk are all
gone up this very minute or we shall lose the great carbuncle

in truth so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty
prize which had lured them thither that they had slept peacefully all
night and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine
while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish
wakefulness or dreamed of climbing precipices and set off to realize
their dreams with the curliest peep of dawn but matthew and hannah
after their calm rest were as light as two young deer and merely
stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the
amonoosuck and then to taste a morsel of food ere they turned their
faces to the mountain-side it was a sweet emblem of conjugal
affection as they toiled up the difficult ascent gathering strength
from the mutual aid which they afforded

after several little accidents such as a torn robe a lost shoe and
the entanglement of hannah's hair in a bough they reached the upper
verge of the forest and were now to pursue a more adventurous course
the innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto
shut in their thoughts which now shrank affrighted from the region of
wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine that rose
immeasurably above them they gazed back at the obscure wilderness
which they had traversed and longed to be buried again in its depths
rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude

shall we go on said matthew throwing his arm round hannah's waist
both to protect her and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to
it

but the little bride simple as she was had a woman's love of jewels
and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the
world in spite of the perils with which it must be won

let us climb a little higher whispered she yet tremulously as she
turned her face upward to the lonely sky

come then said matthew mustering his manly courage and drawing
her along with him for she became timid again the moment that he grew
bold

and upward accordingly went the pilgrims of the great carbuncle now
treading upon the tops and thickly-interwoven branches of dwarf pines
which by the growth of centuries though mossy with age had barely
reached three feet in altitude next they came to masses and fragments
of naked rock heaped confusedly together like a cairn reared by giants
in memory of a giant chief in this bleak realm of upper air nothing
breathed nothing grew there was no life but what was concentred in
their two hearts they had climbed so high that nature herself seemed
no longer to keep them company she lingered beneath them within the
verge of the forest-trees and sent a farewell glance after her
children as they strayed where her own green footprints had never
been but soon they were to be hidden from her eye densely and dark
the mists began to gather below casting black spots of shadow on the
vast landscape and sailing heavily to one centre as if the loftiest
mountain-peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds finally
the vapors welded themselves as it were into a mass presenting the
appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden
but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth
which they had lost and the lovers yearned to behold that green earth
again more intensely alas than beneath a clouded sky they had ever
desired a glimpse of heaven they even felt it a relief to their
desolation when the mists creeping gradually up the mountain
concealed its lonely peak and thus annihilated at least for
them the whole region of visible space but they drew closer together
with a fond and melancholy gaze dreading lest the universal cloud
should snatch them from each other's sight still perhaps they would
have been resolute to climb as far and as high between earth and
heaven as they could find foothold if hannah's strength had not begun
to fail and with that her courage also her breath grew short she
refused to burden her husband with her weight but often tottered
against his side and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort
at last she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity

we are lost dear matthew said she mournfully we shall never
find our way to the earth again and oh how happy we might have been
in our cottage

dear heart we will yet be happy there answered matthew look in
this direction the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist by its aid i
can direct our course to the passage of the notch let us go back
love and dream no more of the great carbuncle

the sun cannot be yonder said hannah with despondence by this
time it must be noon if there could ever be any sunshine here it
would come from above our heads

but look repeated matthew in a somewhat altered tone it is
brightening every moment if not sunshine what can it be

nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking
through the mist and changing its dim hue to a dusky red which
continually grew more vivid as if brilliant particles were interfused
with the gloom now also the cloud began to roll away from the
mountain while as it heavily withdrew one object after another
started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight with precisely
the effect of a new creation before the indistinctness of the old
chaos had been completely swallowed up as the process went on they
saw the gleaming of water close at their feet and found themselves on
the very border of a mountain-lake deep bright clear and calmly
beautiful spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been
scooped out of the solid rock a ray of glory flashed across its
surface the pilgrims looked whence it should proceed but closed
their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration to exclude the fervid
splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff impending over the
enchanted lake

for the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery and found the
long-sought shrine of the great carbuncle they threw their arms
around each other and trembled at their own success for as the
legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory they felt
themselves marked out by fate and the consciousness was fearful
often from childhood upward they had seen it shining like a distant
star and now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their
hearts they seemed changed to one another's eyes in the red
brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks while it lent the same fire
to the lake the rocks and sky and to the mists which had rolled back
before its power but with their next glance they beheld an object
that drew their attention even from the mighty stone at the base of
the cliff directly beneath the great carbuncle appeared the figure
of a man with his arms extended in the act of climbing and his face
turned upward as if to drink the full gush of splendor but he stirred
not no more than if changed to marble

it is the seeker whispered hannah convulsively grasping her
husband's arm matthew he is dead

the joy of success has killed him replied matthew trembling
violently or perhaps the very light of the great carbuncle was
death

the great carbuncle cried a peevish voice behind them the great
humbug if you have found it prithee point it out to me

they turned their heads and there was the cynic with his prodigious
spectacles set carefully on his nose staring now at the lake now at
the rocks now at the distant masses of vapor now right at the great
carbuncle itself yet seemingly as unconscious of its light as if all
the scattered clouds were condensed about his person though its
radiance actually threw the shadow of the unbeliever at his own feet
as he turned his back upon the glorious jewel he would not be
convinced that there was the least glimmer there

where is your great humbug he repeated i challenge you to make me
see it

there said matthew incensed at such perverse blindness and
turning the cynic round toward the illuminated cliff take off those
abominable spectacles and you cannot help seeing it

now these colored spectacles probably darkened the cynic's sight in
at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people
gaze at an eclipse with resolute bravado however he snatched them
from his nose and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the
great carbuncle but scarcely had he encountered it when with a deep
shuddering groan he dropped his head and pressed both hands across
his miserable eyes thenceforth there was in very truth no light of
the great carbuncle nor any other light on earth nor light of heaven
itself for the poor cynic so long accustomed to view all objects
through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness a
single flash of so glorious a phenomenon striking upon his naked
vision had blinded him for ever

matthew said hannah clinging to him let us go hence

matthew saw that she was faint and kneeling down supported her in
his arms while he threw some of the thrillingly-cold water of the
enchanted lake upon her face and bosom it revived her but could not
renovate her courage

yes dearest cried matthew pressing her tremulous form to his
breast we will go hence and return to our humble cottage the
blessed sunshine and the quiet moonlight shall come through our
window we will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth at eventide and
be happy in its light but never again will we desire more light than
all the world may share with us

no said his bride for how could we live by day or sleep by night
in this awful blaze of the great carbuncle

out of the hollow of their hands they drank each a draught from the
lake which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly
lip then lending their guidance to the blinded cynic who uttered
not a word and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched
heart they began to descend the mountain yet as they left the shore
till then untrodden of the spirit's lake they threw a farewell
glance toward the cliff and beheld the vapors gathering in dense
volumes through which the gem burned duskily

as touching the other pilgrims of the great carbuncle the legend goes
on to tell that the worshipful master ichabod pigsnort soon gave up
the quest as a desperate speculation and wisely resolved to betake
himself again to his warehouse near the town-dock in boston but as
he passed through the notch of the mountains a war-party of indians
captured our unlucky merchant and carried him to montreal there
holding him in bondage till by the payment of a heavy ransom he had
woefully subtracted from his hoard of pine-tree shillings by his long
absence moreover his affairs had become so disordered that for the
rest of his life instead of wallowing in silver he had seldom a
sixpence-worth of copper doctor cacaphodel the alchemist returned
to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite which he
ground to powder dissolved in acids melted in the crucible and burnt
with the blowpipe and published the result of his experiments in one
of the heaviest folios of the day and for all these purposes the gem
itself could not have answered better than the granite the poet by a
somewhat similar mistake made prize of a great piece of ice which he
found in a sunless chasm of the mountains and swore that it
corresponded in all points with his idea of the great carbuncle the
critics say that if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem it
retained all the coldness of the ice the lord de vere went back to
his ancestral hall where he contented himself with a wax-lighted
chandelier and filled in due course of time another coffin in the
ancestral vault as the funeral torches gleamed within that dark
receptacle there was no need of the great carbuncle to show the
vanity of earthly pomp

the cynic having cast aside his spectacles wandered about the world
a miserable object and was punished with an agonizing desire of light
for the wilful blindness of his former life the whole night long he
would lift his splendor-blasted orbs to the moon and stars he turned
his face eastward at sunrise as duly as a persian idolater he made a
pilgrimage to rome to witness the magnificent illumination of saint
peter's church and finally perished in the great fire of london into
the midst of which he had thrust himself with the desperate idea of
catching one feeble ray from the blaze that was kindling earth and
heaven

matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years and were fond of
telling the legend of the great carbuncle the tale however toward
the close of their lengthened lives did not meet with the full
credence that had been accorded to it by those who remembered the
ancient lustre of the gem for it is affirmed that from the hour when
two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise as to reject a jewel
which would have dimmed all earthly things its splendor waned when
our pilgrims reached the cliff they found only an opaque stone with
particles of mica glittering on its surface there is also a tradition
that as the youthful pair departed the gem was loosened from the
forehead of the cliff and fell into the enchanted lake and that at
noontide the seeker's form may still be seen to bend over its
quenchless gleam

some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing as of old and
say that they have caught its radiance like a flash of summer
lightning far down the valley of the saco and be it owned that many
a mile from the crystal hills i saw a wondrous light around their
summits and was lured by the faith of poesy to be the latest pilgrim
of the great carbuncle




the prophetic pictures


but this painter cried walter ludlow with animation he not only
excels in his peculiar art but possesses vast acquirements in all
other learning and science he talks hebrew with dr mather and gives
lectures in anatomy to dr boylston in a word he will meet the
best-instructed man among us on his own ground moreover he is a
polished gentleman a citizen of the world yes a true cosmopolite
for he will speak like a native of each clime and country on the
globe except our own forests whither he is now going nor is all
this what i most admire in him

footnote this story was suggested by an anecdote of stuart related
in dunlap's history of the arts of designs a most entertaining
book to the general reader and a deeply-interesting one we should
think to the artist

indeed said elinor who had listened with a women's interest to the
description of such a man yet this is admirable enough

surely it is replied her lover but far less so than his natural
gift of adapting himself to every variety of character insomuch that
all men and all women too elinor shall find a mirror of themselves
in this wonderful painter but the greatest wonder is yet to be told

nay if he have more wonderful attributes than these said elinor
laughing boston is a perilous abode for the poor gentleman are you
telling me of a painter or a wizard

in truth answered he that question might be asked much more
seriously than you suppose they say that he paints not merely a man's
features but his mind and heart he catches the secret sentiments and
passions and throws them upon the canvas like sunshine or perhaps in
the portraits of dark-souled men like a gleam of infernal fire it is
an awful gift added walter lowering his voice from its tone of
enthusiasm i shall be almost afraid to sit to him

walter are you in earnest exclaimed elinor

for heaven's sake dearest elinor do not let him paint the look
which you now wear said her lover smiling though rather perplexed
there it is passing away now but when you spoke you seemed
frightened to death and very sad besides what were you thinking of

nothing nothing answered elinor hastily you paint my face with
your own fantasies well come for me tomorrow and we will visit this
wonderful artist

but when the young man had departed it cannot be denied that a
remarkable expression was again visible on the fair and youthful face
of his mistress it was a sad and anxious look little in accordance
with what should have been the feelings of a maiden on the eve of
wedlock yet walter ludlow was the chosen of her heart

a look said elinor to herself no wonder that it startled him if
it expressed what i sometimes feel i know by my own experience how
frightful a look may be but it was all fancy i thought nothing of it
at the time i have seen nothing of it since i did but dream it and
she busied herself about the embroidery of a ruff in which she meant
that her portrait should be taken

the painter of whom they had been speaking was not one of those native
artists who at a later period than this borrowed their colors from the
indians and manufactured their pencils of the furs of wild beasts
perhaps if he could have revoked his life and prearranged his
destiny he might have chosen to belong to that school without a
master in the hope of being at least original since there were no
works of art to imitate nor rules to follow but he had been born and
educated in europe people said that he had studied the grandeur or
beauty of conception and every touch of the master-hand in all the
most famous pictures in cabinets and galleries and on the walls of
churches till there was nothing more for his powerful mind to learn
art could add nothing to its lessons but nature might he had
therefore visited a world whither none of his professional brethren
had preceded him to feast his eyes on visible images that were noble
and picturesque yet had never been transferred to canvas america was
too poor to afford other temptations to an artist of eminence though
many of the colonial gentry on the painter's arrival had expressed a
wish to transmit their lineaments to posterity by moans of his skill
whenever such proposals were made he fixed his piercing eyes on the
applicant and seemed to look him through and through if he beheld
only a sleek and comfortable visage though there were a gold-laced
coat to adorn the picture and golden guineas to pay for it he civilly
rejected the task and the reward but if the face were the index of
anything uncommon in thought sentiment or experience or if he met a
beggar in the street with a white beard and a furrowed brow or if
sometimes a child happened to look up and smile he would exhaust all
the art on them that he denied to wealth

pictorial skill being so rare in the colonies the painter became an
object of general curiosity if few or none could appreciate the
technical merit of his productions yet there were points in regard to
which the opinion of the crowd was as valuable as the refined judgment
of the amateur he watched the effect that each picture produced on
such untutored beholders and derived profit from their remarks while
they would as soon have thought of instructing nature herself as him
who seemed to rival her their admiration it must be owned was
tinctured with the prejudices of the age and country some deemed it
an offence against the mosaic law and even a presumptuous mockery of
the creator to bring into existence such lively images of his
creatures others frightened at the art which could raise phantoms at
will and keep the form of the dead among the living were inclined to
consider the painter as a magician or perhaps the famous black man of
old witch-times plotting mischief in a new guise these foolish
fancies were more than half believed among the mob even in superior
circles his character was invested with a vague awe partly rising
like smoke-wreaths from the popular superstitions but chiefly caused
by the varied knowledge and talents which he made subservient to his
profession

being on the eve of marriage walter ludlow and elinor were eager to
obtain their portraits as the first of what they doubtless hoped
would be a long series of family pictures the day after the
conversation above recorded they visited the painter's rooms a
servant ushered them into an apartment where though the artist
himself was not visible there were personages whom they could hardly
forbear greeting with reverence they knew indeed that the whole
assembly were but pictures yet felt it impossible to separate the
idea of life and intellect from such striking counterfeits several of
the portraits were known to them either as distinguished characters of
the day or their private acquaintances there was governor burnett
looking as if he had just received an undutiful communication from the
house of representatives and were inditing a most sharp response mr
cooke hung beside the ruler whom he opposed sturdy and somewhat
puritanical as befitted a popular leader the ancient lady of sir
william phipps eyed them from the wall in ruff and farthingale an
imperious old dame not unsuspected of witchcraft john winslow then a
very young man wore the expression of warlike enterprise which long
afterward made him a distinguished general their personal friends
were recognized at a glance in most of the pictures the whole mind
and character were brought out on the countenance and concentrated
into a single look so that to speak paradoxically the originals
hardly resembled themselves so strikingly as the portraits did

among these modern worthies there were two old bearded saints who had
almost vanished into the darkening canvas there was also a pale but
unfaded madonna who had perhaps been worshipped in rome and now
regarded the lovers with such a mild and holy look that they longed to
worship too

how singular a thought observed walter ludlow that this beautiful
face has been beautiful for above two hundred years oh if all beauty
would endure so well do you not envy her elinor

if earth were heaven i might she replied but where all things
fade how miserable to be the one that could not fade

this dark old st peter has a fierce and ugly scowl saint though he
be continued walter he troubles me but the virgin looks kindly at
us

yes but very sorrowfully methinks said elinor

the easel stood beneath these three old pictures sustaining one that
had been recently commenced after a little inspection they began to
recognize the features of their own minister the rev dr colman
growing into shape and life as it were out of a cloud

kind old man exclaimed elinor he gazes at me as if he were about
to utter a word of paternal advice

and at me said walter as if he were about to shake his head and
rebuke me for some suspected iniquity but so does the original i
shall never feel quite comfortable under his eye till we stand before
him to be married

they now heard a footstep on the floor and turning beheld the
painter who had been some moments in the room and had listened to a
few of their remarks he was a middle-aged man with a countenance well
worthy of his own pencil indeed by the picturesque though careless
arrangement of his rich dress and perhaps because his soul dwelt
always among painted shapes he looked somewhat like a portrait
himself his visitors were sensible of a kindred between the artist
and his works and felt as if one of the pictures had stepped from the
canvas to salute them

walter ludlow who was slightly known to the painter explained the
object of their visit while he spoke a sunbeam was falling athwart
his figure and elinor's with so happy an effect that they also seemed
living pictures of youth and beauty gladdened by bright fortune the
artist was evidently struck

my easel is occupied for several ensuing days and my stay in boston
must be brief said he thoughtfully then after an observant
glance he added but your wishes shall be gratified though i
disappoint the chief-justice and madame oliver i must not lose this
opportunity for the sake of painting a few ells of broadcloth and
brocade

the painter expressed a desire to introduce both their portraits into
one picture and represent them engaged in some appropriate action
this plan would have delighted the lovers but was necessarily
rejected because so large a space of canvas would have been unfit for
the room which it was intended to decorate two half-length portraits
were therefore fixed upon after they had taken leave walter ludlow
asked elinor with a smile whether she knew what an influence over
their fates the painter was about to acquire

the old women of boston affirm continued he that after he has
once got possession of a person's face and figure he may paint him in
any act or situation whatever and the picture will be prophetic do
you believe it

not quite said elinor smiling yet if he has such magic there is
something so gentle in his manner that i am sure he will use it well

it was the painter's choice to proceed with both the portraits at the
same time assigning as a reason in the mystical language which he
sometimes used that the faces threw light upon each other
accordingly he gave now a touch to walter and now to elinor and the
features of one and the other began to start forth so vividly that it
appeared as if his triumphant art would actually disengage them from
the canvas amid the rich light and deep shade they beheld their
phantom selves but though the likeness promised to be perfect they
were not quite satisfied with the expression it seemed more vague
than in most of the painter's works he however was satisfied with
the prospect of success and being much interested in the lovers
employed his leisure moments unknown to them in making a crayon
sketch of their two figures during their sittings he engaged them in
conversation and kindled up their faces with characteristic traits
which though continually varying it was his purpose to combine and
fix at length he announced that at their next visit both the
portraits would be ready for delivery

if my pencil will but be true to my conception in the few last
touches which i meditate observed he these two pictures will be my
very best performances seldom indeed has an artist such subjects
while speaking he still bent his penetrative eye upon them nor
withdrew it till they had reached the bottom of the stairs

nothing in the whole circle of human vanities takes stronger hold of
the imagination than this affair of having a portrait painted yet why
should it be so the looking-glass the polished globes of the
andirons the mirror-like water and all other reflecting surfaces
continually present us with portraits or rather ghosts of
ourselves which we glance at and straightway forget them but we
forget them only because they vanish it is the idea of duration of
earthly immortality that gives such a mysterious interest to our own
portraits

walter and elinor were not insensible to this feeling and hastened to
the painter's room punctually at the appointed hour to meet those
pictured shapes which were to be their representatives with posterity
the sunshine flashed after them into the apartment but left it
somewhat gloomy as they closed the door their eyes were immediately
attracted to their portraits which rested against the farthest wall
of the room at the first glance through the dim light and the
distance seeing themselves in precisely their natural attitudes and
with all the air that they recognized so well they uttered a
simultaneous exclamation of delight

there we stand cried walter enthusiastically fixed in sunshine
for ever no dark passions can gather on our faces

no said elinor more calmly no dreary change can sadden us

this was said while they were approaching and had yet gained only an
imperfect view of the pictures the painter after saluting them
busied himself at a table in completing a crayon sketch leaving his
visitors to form their own judgment as to his perfected labors at
intervals he sent a glance from beneath his deep eyebrows watching
their countenances in profile with his pencil suspended over the
sketch they had now stood some moments each in front of the other's
picture contemplating it with entranced attention but without
uttering a word at length walter stepped forward then back viewing
elinor's portrait in various lights and finally spoke

is there not a change said he in a doubtful and meditative tone
yes the perception of it grows more vivid the longer i look it is
certainly the same picture that i saw yesterday the dress the
features all are the same and yet something is altered

is then the picture less like than it was yesterday inquired the
painter now drawing near with irrepressible interest

the features are perfect elinor answered walter and at the first
glance the expression seemed also hers but i could fancy that the
portrait has changed countenance while i have been looking at it the
eyes are fixed on mine with a strangely sad and anxious expression
nay it is grief and terror is this like elinor

compare the living face with the pictured one said the painter

walter glanced sidelong at his mistress and started motionless and
absorbed fascinated as it were in contemplation of walter's
portrait elinor's face had assumed precisely the expression of which
he had just been complaining had she practised for whole hours before
a mirror she could not have caught the look so successfully had the
picture itself been a mirror it could not have thrown back her
present aspect with stronger and more melancholy truth she appeared
quite unconscious of the dialogue between the artist and her lover

elinor exclaimed walter in amazement what change has come over
you

she did not hear him nor desist from her fixed gaze till he seized her
hand and thus attracted her notice then with a sudden tremor she
looked from the picture to the face of the original

do you see no change in your portrait asked she

in mine none replied walter examining it but let me see yes
there is a slight change an improvement i think in the picture
though none in the likeness it has a livelier expression than
yesterday as if some bright thought were flashing from the eyes and
about to be uttered from the lips now that i have caught the look it
becomes very decided

while he was intent on these observations elinor turned to the
painter she regarded him with grief and awe and felt that he repaid
her with sympathy and commiseration though wherefore she could but
vaguely guess

that look whispered she and shuddered how came it there

madam said the painter sadly taking her hand and leading her
apart in both these pictures i have painted what i saw the
artist the true artist must look beneath the exterior it is his
gift his proudest but often a melancholy one to see the inmost
soul and by a power indefinable even to himself to make it glow or
darken upon the canvas in glances that express the thought and
sentiment of years would that i might convince myself of error in the
present instance

they had now approached the table on which were heads in chalk hands
almost as expressive as ordinary faces ivied church-towers thatched
cottages old thunder-stricken trees oriental and antique costume
and all such picturesque vagaries of an artist's idle moments turning
them over with seeming carelessness a crayon sketch of two figures
was disclosed

if i have failed continued he if your heart does not see itself
reflected in your own portrait if you have no secret cause to trust
my delineation of the other it is not yet too late to alter them i
might change the action of these figures too but would it influence
the event he directed her notice to the sketch

a thrill ran through elinor's frame a shriek was upon her lips but
she stifled it with the self-command that becomes habitual to all who
hide thoughts of fear and anguish within their bosoms turning from
the table she perceived that walter had advanced near enough to have
seen the sketch though she could not determine whether it had caught
his eye

we will not have the pictures altered said she hastily if mine
is sad i shall but look the gayer for the contrast

be it so answered the painter bowing may your griefs be such
fanciful ones that only your pictures may mourn for them for your
joys may they be true and deep and paint themselves upon this lovely
face till it quite belie my art

after the marriage of walter and elinor the pictures formed the two
most splendid ornaments of their abode they hung side by side
separated by a narrow panel appearing to eye each other constantly
yet always returning the gaze of the spectator travelled gentlemen
who professed a knowledge of such subjects reckoned these among the
most admirable specimens of modern portraiture while common observers
compared them with the originals feature by feature and were
rapturous in praise of the likeness but it was on a third
class neither travelled connoisseurs nor common observers but people
of natural sensibility that the pictures wrought their strongest
effect such persons might gaze carelessly at first but becoming
interested would return day after day and study these painted faces
like the pages of a mystic volume walter ludlow's portrait attracted
their earliest notice in the absence of himself and his bride they
sometimes disputed as to the expression which the painter had intended
to throw upon the features all agreeing that there was a look of
earnest import though no two explained it alike there was less
diversity of opinion in regard to elinor's picture they differed
indeed in their attempts to estimate the nature and depth of the
gloom that dwelt upon her face but agreed that it was gloom and alien
from the natural temperament of their youthful friend a certain
fanciful person announced as the result of much scrutiny that both
these pictures were parts of one design and that the melancholy
strength of feeling in elinor's countenance bore reference to the more
vivid emotion or as he termed it the wild passion in that of
walter though unskilled in the art he even began a sketch in which
the action of the two figures was to correspond with their mutual
expression

it was whispered among friends that day by day elinor's face was
assuming a deeper shade of pensiveness which threatened soon to render
her too true a counterpart of her melancholy picture walter on the
other hand instead of acquiring the vivid look which the painter had
given him on the canvas became reserved and downcast with no outward
flashes of emotion however it might be smouldering within in course
of time elinor hung a gorgeous curtain of purple silk wrought with
flowers and fringed with heavy golden tassels before the pictures
under pretence that the dust would tarnish their hues or the light dim
them it was enough her visitors felt that the massive folds of the
silk must never be withdrawn nor the portraits mentioned in her
presence

time wore on and the painter came again he had been far enough to
the north to see the silver cascade of the crystal hills and to look
over the vast round of cloud and forest from the summit of new
england's loftiest mountain but he did not profane that scene by the
mockery of his art he had also lain in a canoe on the bosom of lake
george making his soul the mirror of its loveliness and grandeur till
not a picture in the vatican was more vivid than his recollection he
had gone with the indian hunters to niagara and there again had
flung his hopeless pencil down the precipice feeling that he could as
soon paint the roar as aught else that goes to make up the wondrous
cataract in truth it was seldom his impulse to copy natural scenery
except as a framework for the delineations of the human form and face
instinct with thought passion or suffering with store of such his
adventurous ramble had enriched him the stern dignity of indian
chiefs the dusky loveliness of indian girls the domestic life of
wigwams the stealthy march the battle beneath gloomy pine trees the
frontier fortress with its garrison the anomaly of the old french
partisan bred in courts but grown gray in shaggy deserts such were
the scenes and portraits that he had sketched the glow of perilous
moments flashes of wild feeling struggles of fierce power love
hate grief frenzy in a word all the worn-out heart of the old
earth had been revealed to him under a new form his portfolio was
filled with graphic illustrations of the volume of his memory which
genius would transmute into its own substance and imbue with
immortality he felt that the deep wisdom in his art which he had
sought so far was found

but amid stern or lovely nature in the perils of the forest or its
overwhelming peacefulness still there had been two phantoms the
companions of his way like all other men around whom an engrossing
purpose wreathes itself he was insulated from the mass of humankind
he had no aim no pleasure no sympathies but what were ultimately
connected with his art though gentle in manner and upright in intent
and action he did not possess kindly feelings his heart was cold no
living creature could be brought near enough to keep him warm for
these two beings however he had felt in its greatest intensity the
sort of interest which always allied him to the subjects of his
pencil he had pried into their souls with his keenest insight and
pictured the result upon their features with his utmost skill so as
barely to fall short of that standard which no genius ever reached
his own severe conception he had caught from the duskiness of the
future at least so he fancied a fearful secret and had obscurely
revealed it on the portraits so much of himself of his imagination
and all other powers had been lavished on the study of walter and
elinor that he almost regarded them as creations of his own like the
thousands with which he had peopled the realms of picture therefore
did they flit through the twilight of the woods hover on the mist of
waterfalls look forth from the mirror of the lake nor melt away in
the noontide sun they haunted his pictorial fancy not as mockeries
of life nor pale goblins of the dead but in the guise of portraits
each with an unalterable expression which his magic had evoked from
the caverns of the soul he could not recross the atlantic till he had
again beheld the originals of those airy pictures

o glorious art thus mused the enthusiastic painter as he trod the
street thou art the image of the creator's own the innumerable
forms that wander in nothingness start into being at thy beck the
dead live again thou recallest them to their old scenes and givest
their gray shadows the lustre of a better life at once earthly and
immortal thou snatchest back the fleeting moments of history with
then there is no past for at thy touch all that is great becomes for
ever present and illustrious men live through long ages in the
visible performance of the very deeds which made them what they are o
potent art as thou bringest the faintly-revealed past to stand in
that narrow strip of sunlight which we call now canst thou summon
the shrouded future to meet her there have i not achieved it am i
not thy prophet

thus with a proud yet melancholy fervor did he almost cry aloud as he
passed through the toilsome street among people that knew not of his
reveries nor could understand nor care for them it is not good for
man to cherish a solitary ambition unless there be those around him
by whose example he may regulate himself his thoughts desires and
hopes will become extravagant and he the semblance perhaps the
reality of a madman reading other bosoms with an acuteness almost
preternatural the painter failed to see the disorder of his own

and this should be the house said he looking up and down the front
before he knocked heaven help my brains that picture methinks it
will never vanish whether i look at the windows or the door there it
is framed within them painted strongly and glowing in the richest
tints the faces of the portraits the figures and action of the
sketch

he knocked

the portraits are they within inquired he of the domestic then
recollecting himself your master and mistress are they at home

they are sir said the servant adding as he noticed that
picturesque aspect of which the painter could never divest himself
and the portraits too

the guest was admitted into a parlor communicating by a central door
with an interior room of the same size as the first apartment was
empty he passed to the entrance of the second within which his eyes
were greeted by those living personages as well as their pictured
representatives who had long been the objects of so singular an
interest he involuntarily paused on the threshold

they had not perceived his approach walter and elinor were standing
before the portraits whence the former had just flung back the rich
and voluminous folds of the silken curtain holding its golden tassel
with one hand while the other grasped that of his bride the
pictures concealed for months gleamed forth again in undiminished
splendor appearing to throw a sombre light across the room rather
than to be disclosed by a borrowed radiance that of elinor had been
almost prophetic a pensiveness and next a gentle sorrow had
successively dwelt upon her countenance deepening with the lapse of
time into a quiet anguish a mixture of affright would now have made
it the very expression of the portrait walter's face was moody and
dull or animated only by fitful flashes which left a heavier darkness
for their momentary illumination he looked from elinor to her
portrait and thence to his own in the contemplation of which he
finally stood absorbed

the painter seemed to hear the step of destiny approaching behind him
on its progress toward its victims a strange thought darted into his
mind was not his own the form in which that destiny had embodied
itself and he a chief agent of the coming evil which he had
foreshadowed

still walter remained silent before the picture communing with it as
with his own heart and abandoning himself to the spell of evil
influence that the painter had cast upon the features gradually his
eyes kindled while as elinor watched the increasing wildness of his
face her own assumed a look of terror and when at last he turned
upon her the resemblance of both to their portraits was complete

our fate is upon us howled walter die

drawing a knife he sustained her as she was sinking to the ground
and aimed it at her bosom in the action and in the look and attitude
of each the painter beheld the figures of his sketch the picture
with all its tremendous coloring was finished

hold madman cried he sternly

he had advanced from the door and interposed himself between the
wretched beings with the same sense of power to regulate their destiny
as to alter a scene upon the canvas he stood like a magician
controlling the phantoms which he had evoked

what muttered walter ludlow as he relapsed from fierce excitement
into sullen gloom does fate impede its own decree

wretched lady said the painter did i not warn you

you did replied elinor calmly as her terror gave place to the
quiet grief which it had disturbed but i loved him

is there not a deep moral in the tale could the result of one or all
our deeds be shadowed forth and set before us some would call it fate
and hurry onward others be swept along by their passionate desires
and none be turned aside by the prophetic pictures




david swan

a fantasy


we can be but partially acquainted even with the events which actually
influence our course through life and our final destiny there are
innumerable other events if such they may be called which come close
upon us yet pass away without actual results or even betraying their
near approach by the reflection of any light or shadow across our
minds could we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes life would
be too full of hope and fear exultation or disappointment to afford
us a single hour of true serenity this idea may be illustrated by a
page from the secret history of david swan

we have nothing to do with david until we find him at the age of
twenty on the high road from his native place to the city of boston
where his uncle a small dealer in the grocery line was to take him
behind the counter be it enough to say that he was a native of new
hampshire born of respectable parents and had received an ordinary
school education with a classic finish by a year at gilmanton academy
after journeying on foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summer's
day his weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit down
in the first convenient shade and await the coming up of the
stage-coach as if planted on purpose for him there soon appeared a
little tuft of maples with a delightful recess in the midst and such
a fresh bubbling spring that it seemed never to have sparkled for any
wayfarer but david swan virgin or not he kissed it with his thirsty
lips and then flung himself along the brink pillowing his head upon
some shirts and a pair of pantaloons tied up in a striped cotton
handkerchief the sunbeams could not reach him the dust did not yet
rise from the road after the heavy rain of yesterday and his grassy
lair suited the young man better than a bed of down the spring
murmured drowsily beside him the branches waved dreamily across the
blue sky overhead and a deep sleep perchance hiding dreams within
its depths fell upon david swan but we are to relate events which he
did not dream of

while he lay sound asleep in the shade other people were wide awake
and passed to and fro afoot on horseback and in all sorts of
vehicles along the sunny road by his bedchamber some looked neither
to the right hand nor the left and knew not that he was there some
merely glanced that way without admitting the slumberer among their
busy thoughts some laughed to see how soundly he slept and several
whose hearts were brimming full of scorn ejected their venomous
superfluity on david swan a middle-aged widow when nobody else was
near thrust her head a little way into the recess and vowed that the
young fellow looked charming in his sleep a temperance lecturer saw
him and wrought poor david into the texture of his evening's
discourse as an awful instance of dead drunkenness by the roadside

but censure praise merriment scorn and indifference were all
one or rather all nothing to david swan he had slept only a few
moments when a brown carriage drawn by a handsome pair of horses
bowled easily along and was brought to a standstill nearly in front of
david's resting-place a linch-pin had fallen out and permitted one of
the wheels to slide off the damage was slight and occasioned merely a
momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife who were
returning to boston in the carriage while the coachman and a servant
were replacing the wheel the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves
beneath the maple trees and there espied the bubbling fountain and
david swan asleep beside it impressed with the awe which the humblest
sleeper usually sheds around him the merchant trod as lightly as the
gout would allow and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk
gown lest david should start up all of a sudden

how soundly he sleeps whispered the old gentleman from what a
depth he draws that easy breath such sleep as that brought on
without an opiate would be worth more to me than half my income for
it would suppose health and an untroubled mind

and youth besides said the lady healthy and quiet age does not
sleep thus our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness

the longer they looked the more did this elderly couple feel
interested in the unknown youth to whom the wayside and the maple
shade were as a secret chamber with the rich gloom of damask curtains
brooding over him perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon
his face the lady contrived to twist a branch aside so as to
intercept it and having done this little act of kindness she began
to feel like a mother to him

providence seems to have laid him here whispered she to her
husband and to have brought us hither to find him after our
disappointment in our cousin's son methinks i can see a likeness to
our departed henry shall we waken him

to what purpose said the merchant hesitating we know nothing of
the youth's character

that open countenance replied his wife in the same hushed voice
yet earnestly this innocent sleep

while these whispers were passing the sleeper's heart did not throb
nor his breath become agitated nor his features betray the least
token of interest yet fortune was bending over him just ready to let
fall a burden of gold the old merchant had lost his only son and had
no heir to his wealth except a distant relative with whose conduct he
was dissatisfied in such cases people sometimes do stranger things
than to act the magician and awaken a young man to splendor who fell
asleep in poverty

shall we not waken him repeated the lady persuasively

the coach is ready sir said the servant behind

the old couple started reddened and hurried away mutually wondering
that they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so very
ridiculous the merchant threw himself back in the carriage and
occupied his mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for
unfortunate men of business meanwhile david swan enjoyed his nap

the carriage could not have gone above a mile or two when a pretty
young girl came along with a tripping pace which showed precisely how
her little heart was dancing in her bosom perhaps it was this merry
kind of motion that caused is there any harm in saying it her
garter to slip its knot conscious that the silken girth if silk it
were was relaxing its hold she turned aside into the shelter of the
maple trees and there found a young man asleep by the spring
blushing as red as any rose that she should have intruded into a
gentleman's bedchamber and for such a purpose too she was about to
make her escape on tiptoe but there was peril near the sleeper a
monster of a bee had been wandering overhead buzz buzz buzz now
among the leaves now flashing through the strips of sunshine and now
lost in the dark shade till finally he appeared to be settling on the
eyelid of david swan the sting of a bee is sometimes deadly as
free-hearted as she was innocent the girl attacked the intruder with
her handkerchief brushed him soundly and drove him from beneath the
maple shade how sweet a picture this good deed accomplished with
quickened breath and a deeper blush she stole a glance at the youthful
stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air

he is handsome thought she and blushed redder yet

how could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him that
shattered by its very strength it should part asunder and allow him
to perceive the girl among its phantoms why at least did no smile
of welcome brighten upon his face she was come the maid whose soul
according to the old and beautiful idea had been severed from his
own and whom in all his vague but passionate desires he yearned to
meet her only could he love with a perfect love him only could she
receive into the depths of her heart and now her image was faintly
blushing in the fountain by his side should it pass away its happy
lustre would never gleam upon his life again

how sound he sleeps murmured the girl she departed but did not
trip along the road so lightly as when she came

now this girl's father was a thriving country merchant in the
neighborhood and happened at that identical time to be looking out
for just such a young man as david swan had david formed a wayside
acquaintance with the daughter he would have become the father's
clerk and all else in natural succession so here again had good
fortune the best of fortunes stolen so near that her garments
brushed against him and he knew nothing of the matter

the girl was hardly out of sight when two men turned aside beneath the
maple shade both had dark faces set off by cloth caps which were
drawn down aslant over their brows their dresses were shabby yet had
a certain smartness these were a couple of rascals who got their
living by whatever the devil sent them and now in the interim of
other business had staked the joint profits of their next piece of
villainy on a game of cards which was to have been decided here under
the trees but finding david asleep by the spring one of the rogues
whispered to his fellow

hist do you see that bundle under his head

the other villain nodded winked and leered

i'll bet you a horn of brandy said the first that the chap has
either a pocketbook or a snug little hoard of small change stowed away
amongst his shirts and if not there we will find it in his
pantaloons pocket

but how if he wakes said the other

his companion thrust aside his waistcoat pointed to the handle of a
dirk and nodded

so be it muttered the second villain

they approached the unconscious david and while one pointed the
dagger toward his heart the other began to search the bundle beneath
his head their two faces grim wrinkled and ghastly with guilt and
fear bent over their victim looking horrible enough to be mistaken
for fiends should he suddenly awake nay had the villains glanced
aside into the spring even they would hardly have known themselves as
reflected there but david swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect
even when asleep on his mother's breast

i must take away the bundle whispered one

if he stirs i'll strike muttered the other

but at this moment a dog scenting along the ground came in beneath the
maple trees and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men and then
at the quiet sleeper he then lapped out of the fountain

pshaw said one villain we can do nothing now the dog's master
must be close behind

let's take a drink and be off said the other

the man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom and drew
forth a pocket-pistol but not of that kind which kills by a single
discharge it was a flask of liquor with a block-tin tumbler screwed
upon the mouth each drank a comfortable dram and left the spot with
so many jests and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness
that they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing in a few
hours they had forgotten the whole affair nor once imagined that the
recording angel had written down the crime of murder against their
souls in letters as durable as eternity as for david swan he still
slept quietly neither conscious of the shadow of death when it hung
over him nor of the glow of renewed life when that shadow was
withdrawn he slept but no longer so quietly as at first an hour's
repose had snatched from his elastic frame the weariness with which
many hours of toil had burdened it now he stirred now moved his lips
without a sound now talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres
of his dream but a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder
along the road until it dashed through the dispersing mist of david's
slumber and there was the stagecoach he started up with all his
ideas about him

halloo driver take a passenger shouted he

room on top answered the driver

up mounted david and bowled away merrily toward boston without so
much as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude he
knew not that a phantom of wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its
waters nor that one of love had sighed softly to their murmur nor
that one of death had threatened to crimson them with his blood all
in the brief hour since he lay down to sleep sleeping or waking we
hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen
does it not argue a superintending providence that while viewless and
unexpected events thrust themselves continually athwart our path
there should still be regularity enough in mortal life to render
foresight even partially available




sights from a steeple


so i have climbed high and my reward is small here i stand with
wearied knees earth indeed at a dizzy depth below but heaven far
far beyond me still oh that i could soar up into the very zenith
where man never breathed nor eagle ever flew and where the ethereal
azure melts away from the eye and appears only a deepened shade of
nothingness and yet i shiver at that cold and solitary thought what
clouds are gathering in the golden west with direful intent against
the brightness and the warmth of this summer afternoon they are
ponderous air-ships black as death and freighted with the tempest
and at intervals their thunder the signal-guns of that unearthly
squadron rolls distant along the deep of heaven these nearer heaps
of fleecy vapor methinks i could roll and toss upon them the whole
day long seem scattered here and there for the repose of tired
pilgrims through the sky perhaps for who can tell beautiful
spirits are disporting themselves there and will bless my mortal eye
with the brief appearance of their curly locks of golden light and
laughing faces fair and faint as the people of a rosy dream or where
the floating mass so imperfectly obstructs the color of the firmament
a slender foot and fairy limb resting too heavily upon the frail
support may be thrust through and suddenly withdrawn while longing
fancy follows them in vain yonder again is an airy archipelago
where the sunbeams love to linger in their journeyings through space
every one of those little clouds has been dipped and steeped in
radiance which the slightest pressure might disengage in silvery
profusion like water wrung from a sea-maid's hair bright they are as
a young man's visions and like them would be realized in dullness
obscurity and tears i will look on them no more

in three parts of the visible circle whose centre is this spire i
discern cultivated fields villages white country-seats the waving
lines of rivulets little placid lakes and here and there a rising
ground that would fain be termed a hill on the fourth side is the
sea stretching away toward a viewless boundary blue and calm except
where the passing anger of a shadow flits across its surface and is
gone hitherward a broad inlet penetrates far into the land on the
verge of the harbor formed by its extremity is a town and over it am
i a watchman all-heeding and unheeded oh that the multitude of
chimneys could speak like those of madrid and betray in smoky
whispers the secrets of all who since their first foundation have
assembled at the hearths within oh that the limping devil of le sage
would perch beside me here extend his wand over this contiguity of
roofs uncover every chamber and make me familiar with their
inhabitants the most desirable mode of existence might be that of a
spiritualized paul pry hovering invisible round man and woman
witnessing their deeds searching into their hearts borrowing
brightness from their felicity and shade from their sorrow and
retaining no emotion peculiar to himself but none of these things are
possible and if i would know the interior of brick walls or the
mystery of human bosoms i can but guess

yonder is a fair street extending north and south the stately
mansions are placed each on its carpet of verdant grass and a long
flight of steps descends from every door to the pavement ornamental
trees the broadleafed horse-chestnut the elm so lofty and bending
the graceful but infrequent willow and others whereof i know not the
names grow thrivingly among brick and stone the oblique rays of the
sun are intercepted by these green citizens and by the houses so that
one side of the street is a shaded and pleasant walk on its whole
extent there is now but a single passenger advancing from the upper
end and he unless distance and the medium of a pocket spyglass do
him more than justice is a fine young man of twenty he saunters
slowly forward slapping his left hand with his folded gloves bending
his eyes upon the pavement and sometimes raising them to throw a
glance before him certainly he has a pensive air is he in doubt or
in debt is he if the question be allowable in love does he strive
to be melancholy and gentlemanlike or is he merely overcome by the
heat but i bid him farewell for the present the door of one of the
houses an aristocratic edifice with curtains of purple and gold
waving from the windows is now opened and down the steps come two
ladies swinging their parasols and lightly arrayed for a summer
ramble both are young both are pretty but methinks the left-hand
lass is the fairer of the twain and though she be so serious at this
moment i could swear that there is a treasure of gentle fun within
her they stand talking a little while upon the steps and finally
proceed up the street meantime as their faces are now turned from
me i may look elsewhere

upon that wharf and down the corresponding street is a busy contrast
to the quiet scene which i have just noticed business evidently has
its centre there and many a man is wasting the summer afternoon in
labor and anxiety in losing riches or in gaining them when he would
be wiser to flee away to some pleasant country village or shaded lake
in the forest or wild and cool sea-beach i see vessels unlading at
the wharf and precious merchandise strown upon the ground abundantly
as at the bottom of the sea that market whence no goods return and
where there is no captain nor supercargo to render an account of
sales here the clerks are diligent with their paper and pencils and
sailors ply the block and tackle that hang over the hold accompanying
their toil with cries long-drawn and roughly melodious till the bales
and puncheons ascend to upper air at a little distance a group of
gentlemen are assembled round the door of a warehouse grave seniors
be they and i would wager if it were safe in these times to be
responsible for any one that the least eminent among them might vie
with old vincentio that incomparable trafficker of pisa i can even
select the wealthiest of the company it is the elderly personage in
somewhat rusty black with powdered hair the superfluous whiteness of
which is visible upon the cape of his coat his twenty ships are
wafted on some of their many courses by every breeze that blows and
his name i will venture to say though i know it not is a familiar
sound among the far-separated merchants of europe and the indies

but i bestow too much of my attention in this quarter on looking
again to the long and shady walk i perceive that the two fair girls
have encountered the young man after a sort of shyness in the
recognition he turns back with them moreover he has sanctioned my
taste in regard to his companions by placing himself on the inner side
of the pavement nearest the venus to whom i enacting on a
steeple-top the part of paris on the top of ida adjudged the golden
apple

in two streets converging at right angles toward my watch-tower i
distinguish three different processions one is a proud array of
voluntary soldiers in bright uniform resembling from the height
whence i look down the painted veterans that garrison the windows of
a toy-shop and yet it stirs my heart their regular advance their
nodding plumes the sun-flash on their bayonets and musket-barrels
the roll of their drums ascending past me and the fife ever and anon
piercing through these things have wakened a warlike fire peaceful
though i be close to their rear marches a battalion of schoolboys
ranged in crooked and irregular platoons shouldering sticks thumping
a harsh and unripe clatter from an instrument of tin and ridiculously
aping the intricate manoeuvres of the foremost band nevertheless as
slight differences are scarcely perceptible from a church-spire one
might be tempted to ask which are the boys or rather which the
men but leaving these let us turn to the third procession which
though sadder in outward show may excite identical reflections in the
thoughtful mind it is a funeral a hearse drawn by a black and bony
steed and covered by a dusty pall two or three coaches rumbling over
the stones their drivers half asleep a dozen couple of careless
mourners in their every-day attire such was not the fashion of our
fathers when they carried a friend to his grave there is now no
doleful clang of the bell to proclaim sorrow to the town was the king
of terrors more awful in those days than in our own that wisdom and
philosophy have been able to produce this change not so here is a
proof that he retains his proper majesty the military men and the
military boys are wheeling round the corner and meet the funeral full
in the face immediately the drum is silent all but the tap that
regulates each simultaneous footfall the soldiers yield the path to
the dusty hearse and unpretending train and the children quit their
ranks and cluster on the sidewalks with timorous and instinctive
curiosity the mourners enter the churchyard at the base of the
steeple and pause by an open grave among the burial-stones the
lightning glimmers on them as they lower down the coffin and the
thunder rattles heavily while they throw the earth upon its lid
verily the shower is near and i tremble for the young man and the
girls who have now disappeared from the long and shady street

how various are the situations of the people covered by the roofs
beneath me and how diversified are the events at this moment
befalling them the new-born the aged the dying the strong in life
and the recent dead are in the chambers of these many mansions the
full of hope the happy the miserable and the desperate dwell
together within the circle of my glance in some of the houses over
which my eyes roam so coldly guilt is entering into hearts that are
still tenanted by a debased and trodden virtue guilt is on the very
edge of commission and the impending deed might be averted guilt is
done and the criminal wonders if it be irrevocable there are broad
thoughts struggling in my mind and were i able to give them
distinctness they would make their way in eloquence lo the
raindrops are descending

the clouds within a little time have gathered over all the sky
hanging heavily as if about to drop in one unbroken mass upon the
earth at intervals the lightning flashes from their brooding hearts
quivers disappears and then comes the thunder travelling slowly
after its twin-born flame a strong wind has sprung up howls through
the darkened streets and raises the dust in dense bodies to rebel
against the approaching storm the disbanded soldiers fly the funeral
has already vanished like its dead and all people hurry homeward all
that have a home while a few lounge by the corners or trudge on
desperately at their leisure in a narrow lane which communicates with
the shady street i discern the rich old merchant putting himself to
the top of his speed lest the rain should convert his hair-powder to a
paste unhappy gentleman by the slow vehemence and painful moderation
wherewith he journeys it is but too evident that podagra has left its
thrilling tenderness in his great toe but yonder at a far more rapid
pace come three other of my acquaintance the two pretty girls and
the young man unseasonably interrupted in their walk their footsteps
are supported by the risen dust the wind lends them its velocity
they fly like three sea-birds driven landward by the tempestuous
breeze the ladies would not thus rival atalanta if they but knew that
any one were at leisure to observe them ah as they hasten onward
laughing in the angry face of nature a sudden catastrophe has
chanced at the corner where the narrow lane enters into the street
they come plump against the old merchant whose tortoise-motion has
just brought him to that point he likes not the sweet encounter the
darkness of the whole air gathers speedily upon his visage and there
is a pause on both sides finally he thrusts aside the youth with
little courtesy seizes an arm of each of the two girls and plods
onward like a magician with a prize of captive fairies all this is
easy to be understood how disconsolate the poor lover stands
regardless of the rain that threatens an exceeding damage to his
well-fashioned habiliments till he catches a backward glance of mirth
from a bright eye and turns away with whatever comfort it conveys

the old man and his daughters are safely housed and now the storm
lets loose its fury in every dwelling i perceive the faces of the
chambermaids as they shut down the windows excluding the impetuous
shower and shrinking away from the quick fiery glare the large drops
descend with force upon the slated roofs and rise again in smoke
there is a rush and roar as of a river through the air and muddy
streams bubble majestically along the pavement whirl their dusky foam
into the kennel and disappear beneath iron grates thus did arethusa
sink i love not my station here aloft in the midst of the tumult
which i am powerless to direct or quell with the blue lightning
wrinkling on my brow and the thunder muttering its first awful
syllables in my ear i will descend yet let me give another glance to
the sea where the foam breaks out in long white lines upon a broad
expanse of blackness or boils up in far-distant points like snowy
mountain-tops in the eddies of a flood and let me look once more at
the green plain and little hills of the country over which the giant
of the storm is striding in robes of mist and at the town whose
obscured and desolate streets might beseem a city of the dead and
turning a single moment to the sky now gloomy as an author's
prospects i prepare to resume my station on lower earth but stay a
little speck of azure has widened in the western heavens the sunbeams
find a passage and go rejoicing through the tempest and on yonder
darkest cloud born like hallowed hopes of the glory of another world
and the trouble and tears of this brightens forth the rainbow




the hollow of the three hills


in those strange old times when fantastic dreams and madmen's reveries
were realized among the actual circumstances of life two persons met
together at an appointed hour and place one was a lady graceful in
form and fair of feature though pale and troubled and smitten with an
untimely blight in what should have been the fullest bloom of her
years the other was an ancient and meanly-dressed woman of
ill-favored aspect and so withered shrunken and decrepit that even
the space since she began to decay must have exceeded the ordinary
term of human existence in the spot where they encountered no mortal
could observe them three little hills stood near each other and down
in the midst of them sunk a hollow basin almost mathematically
circular two or three hundred feet in breadth and of such depth that
a stately cedar might but just be visible above the sides dwarf pines
were numerous upon the hills and partly fringed the outer verge of the
intermediate hollow within which there was nothing but the brown
grass of october and here and there a tree-trunk that had fallen long
ago and lay mouldering with no green successor from its roots one of
these masses of decaying wood formerly a majestic oak rested close
beside a pool of green and sluggish water at the bottom of the basin
such scenes as this so gray tradition tells were once the resort of
a power of evil and his plighted subjects and here at midnight or on
the dim verge of evening they were said to stand round the mantling
pool disturbing its putrid waters in the performance of an impious
baptismal rite the chill beauty of an autumnal sunset was now gilding
the three hill-tops whence a paler tint stole down their sides into
the hollow

here is our pleasant meeting come to pass said the aged crone
according as thou hast desired say quickly what thou wouldst have of
me for there is but a short hour that we may tarry here

as the old withered woman spoke a smile glimmered on her countenance
like lamplight on the wall of a sepulchre the lady trembled and cast
her eyes upward to the verge of the basin as if meditating to return
with her purpose unaccomplished but it was not so ordained

i am stranger in this land as you know said she at length
whence i come it matters not but i have left those behind me with
whom my fate was intimately bound and from whom i am cut off for
ever there is a weight in my bosom that i cannot away with and i
have come hither to inquire of their welfare

and who is there by this green pool that can bring thee news from the
ends of the earth cried the old woman peering into the lady's face
not from my lips mayst thou hear these tidings yet be thou bold and
the daylight shall not pass away from yonder hilltop before thy wish
be granted

i will do your bidding though i die replied the lady desperately

the old woman seated herself on the trunk of the fallen tree threw
aside the hood that shrouded her gray locks and beckoned her companion
to draw near

kneel down she said and lay your forehead on my knees

she hesitated a moment but the anxiety that had long been kindling
burned fiercely up within her as she knelt down the border of her
garment was dipped into the pool she laid her forehead on the old
woman's knees and the latter drew a cloak about the lady's face so
that she was in darkness then she heard the muttered words of prayer
in the midst of which she started and would have arisen

let me flee let me flee and hide myself that they may not look upon
me she cried but with returning recollection she hushed herself
and was still as death for it seemed as if other voices familiar in
infancy and unforgotten through many wanderings and in all the
vicissitudes of her heart and fortune were mingling with the accents
of the prayer at first the words were faint and indistinct not
rendered so by distance but rather resembling the dim pages of a book
which we strive to read by an imperfect and gradually brightening
light in such a manner as the prayer proceeded did those voices
strengthen upon the ear till at length the petition ended and the
conversation of an aged man and of a woman broken and decayed like
himself became distinctly audible to the lady as she knelt but those
strangers appeared not to stand in the hollow depth between the three
hills their voices were encompassed and re-echoed by the walls of a
chamber the windows of which were rattling in the breeze the regular
vibration of a clock the crackling of a fire and the tinkling of the
embers as they fell among the ashes rendered the scene almost as vivid
as if painted to the eye by a melancholy hearth sat these two old
people the man calmly despondent the woman querulous and tearful
and their words were all of sorrow they spoke of a daughter a
wanderer they knew not where bearing dishonor along with her and
leaving shame and affliction to bring their gray heads to the grave
they alluded also to other and more recent woe but in the midst of
their talk their voices seemed to melt into the sound of the wind
sweeping mournfully among the autumn leaves and when the lady lifted
her eyes there was she kneeling in the hollow between three hills

a weary and lonesome time yonder old couple have of it remarked the
old woman smiling in the lady's face

and did you also hear them exclaimed she a sense of intolerable
humiliation triumphing over her agony and fear

yea and we have yet more to hear replied the old woman wherefore
cover thy face quickly

again the withered hag poured forth the monotonous words of a prayer
that was not meant to be acceptable in heaven and soon in the pauses
of her breath strange murmurings began to thicken gradually
increasing so as to drown and overpower the charm by which they grew
shrieks pierced through the obscurity of sound and were succeeded by
the singing of sweet female voices which in their turn gave way to a
wild roar of laughter broken suddenly by groanings and sobs forming
altogether a ghastly confusion of terror and mourning and mirth
chains were rattling fierce and stern voices uttered threats and the
scourge resounded at their command all these noises deepened and
became substantial to the listener's ear till she could distinguish
every soft and dreamy accent of the love-songs that died causelessly
into funeral-hymns she shuddered at the unprovoked wrath which blazed
up like the spontaneous kindling of flume and she grew faint at the
fearful merriment raging miserably around her in the midst of this
wild scene where unbound passions jostled each other in a drunken
career there was one solemn voice of a man and a manly and melodious
voice it might once have been he went to and fro continually and his
feet sounded upon the floor in each member of that frenzied company
whose own burning thoughts had become their exclusive world he sought
an auditor for the story of his individual wrong and interpreted
their laughter and tears as his reward of scorn or pity he spoke of
woman's perfidy of a wife who had broken her holiest vows of a home
and heart made desolate even as he went on the shout the laugh the
shriek the sob rose up in unison till they changed into the hollow
fitful and uneven sound of the wind as it fought among the pine trees
on those three lonely hills

the lady looked up and there was the withered woman smiling in her
face

couldst thou have thought there were such merry times in a
mad-house inquired the latter

true true said the lady to herself there is mirth within its
walls but misery misery without

wouldst thou hear more demanded the old woman

there is one other voice i would fain listen to again replied the
lady faintly

then lay down thy head speedily upon my knees that thou mayst get
thee hence before the hour be past

the golden skirts of day were yet lingering upon the hills but deep
shades obscured the hollow and the pool as if sombre night wore
rising thence to overspread the world again that evil woman began to
weave her spell long did it proceed unanswered till the knolling of
a bell stole in among the intervals of her words like a clang that had
travelled far over valley and rising ground and was just ready to die
in the air the lady shook upon her companion's knees as she heard
that boding sound stronger it grew and sadder and deepened into the
tone of a death-bell knolling dolefully from some ivy-mantled tower
and bearing tidings of mortality and woe to the cottage to the hall
and to the solitary wayfarer that all might weep for the doom
appointed in turn to them then came a measured tread passing slowly
slowly on as of mourners with a coffin their garments trailing on
the ground so that the ear could measure the length of their
melancholy array before them went the priest reading the
burial-service while the leaves of his book were rustling in the
breeze and though no voice but his was heard to speak aloud still
there were revilings and anathemas whispered but distinct from women
and from men breathed against the daughter who had wrung the aged
hearts of her parents the wife who had betrayed the trusting fondness
of her husband the mother who had sinned against natural affection
and left her child to die the sweeping sound of the funeral train
faded away like a thin vapor and the wind that just before had
seemed to shake the coffin-pall moaned sadly round the verge of the
hollow between three hills but when the old woman stirred the
kneeling lady she lifted not her head

here has been a sweet hour's sport said the withered crone
chuckling to herself




the toll-gatherer's day

a sketch of transitory life


methinks for a person whose instinct bids him rather to pore over the
current of life than to plunge into its tumultuous waves no
undesirable retreat were a toll-house beside some thronged
thoroughfare of the land in youth perhaps it is good for the
observer to run about the earth to leave the track of his footsteps
far and wide to mingle himself with the action of numberless
vicissitudes and finally in some calm solitude to feed a musing
spirit on all that he has seen and felt but there are natures too
indolent or too sensitive to endure the dust the sunshine or the
rain the turmoil of moral and physical elements to which all the
wayfarers of the world expose themselves for such a man how pleasant
a miracle could life be made to roll its variegated length by the
threshold of his own hermitage and the great globe as it were
perform its revolutions and shift its thousand scenes before his eyes
without whirling him onward in its course if any mortal be favored
with a lot analogous to this it is the toll-gatherer so at least
have i often fancied while lounging on a bench at the door of a small
square edifice which stands between shore and shore in the midst of a
long bridge beneath the timbers ebbs and flows an arm of the sea
while above like the life-blood through a great artery the travel of
the north and east is continually throbbing sitting on the aforesaid
bench i amuse myself with a conception illustrated by numerous
pencil-sketches in the air of the toll-gatherer's day

in the morning dim gray dewy summer's morn the distant roll of
ponderous wheels begins to mingle with my old friend's slumbers
creaking more and more harshly through the midst of his dream and
gradually replacing it with realities hardly conscious of the change
from sleep to wakefulness he finds himself partly clad and throwing
wide the toll-gates for the passage of a fragrant load of hay the
timbers groan beneath the slow-revolving wheels one sturdy yeoman
stalks beside the oxen and peering from the summit of the hay by
the glimmer of the half-extinguished lantern over the toll-house is
seen the drowsy visage of his comrade who has enjoyed a nap some ten
miles long the toll is paid creak creak again go the wheels and
the huge hay-mow vanishes into the morning mist as yet nature is but
half awake and familiar objects appear visionary but yonder dashing
from the shore with a rattling thunder of the wheels and a confused
clatter of hoofs comes the never-tiring mail which has hurried
onward at the same headlong restless rate all through the quiet
night the bridge resounds in one continued peal as the coach rolls on
without a pause merely affording the toll-gatherer a glimpse at the
sleepy passengers who now bestir their torpid limbs and snuff a
cordial in the briny air the morn breathes upon them and blushes and
they forget how wearily the darkness toiled away and behold now the
fervid day in his bright chariot glittering aslant over the waves
nor scorning to throw a tribute of his golden beams on the
toll-gatherer's little hermitage the old man looks eastward and for
he is a moralizer frames a simile of the stage-coach and the sun

while the world is rousing itself we may glance slightly at the scene
of our sketch it sits above the bosom of the broad flood a spot not
of earth but in the midst of waters which rush with a murmuring sound
among the massive beams beneath over the door is a weatherbeaten
board inscribed with the rates of toll in letters so nearly effaced
that the gilding of the sunshine can hardly make them legible beneath
the window is a wooden bench on which a long succession of weary
wayfarers have reposed themselves peeping within-doors we perceive
the whitewashed walls bedecked with sundry lithographic prints and
advertisements of various import and the immense show-bill of a
wandering caravan and there sits our good old toll-gatherer
glorified by the early sunbeams he is a man as his aspect may
announce of quiet soul and thoughtful shrewd yet simple mind who
of the wisdom which the passing world scatters along the wayside has
gathered a reasonable store

now the sun smiles upon the landscape and earth smiles back again upon
the sky frequent now are the travellers the toll-gatherer's
practised ear can distinguish the weight of every vehicle the number
of its wheels and how many horses beat the resounding timbers with
their iron tramp here in a substantial family chaise setting forth
betimes to take advantage of the dewy road come a gentleman and his
wife with their rosy-cheeked little girl sitting gladsomely between
them the bottom of the chaise is heaped with multifarious bandboxes
and carpet-bags and beneath the axle swings a leathern trunk dusty
with yesterday's journey next appears a four-wheeled carryall peopled
with a round half dozen of pretty girls all drawn by a single horse
and driven by a single gentleman luckless wight doomed through a
whole summer day to be the butt of mirth and mischief among the
frolicsome maidens bolt upright in a sulky rides a thin sour-visaged
man who as he pays his toll hands the toll-gatherer a printed card to
stick upon the wall the vinegar-faced traveller proves to be a
manufacturer of pickles now paces slowly from timber to timber a
horseman clad in black with a meditative brow as of one who
whithersoever his steed might bear him would still journey through a
mist of brooding thought he is a country preacher going to labor at a
protracted meeting the next object passing townward is a butcher's
cart canopied with its arch of snow-white cotton behind comes a
sauceman driving a wagon full of new potatoes green ears of corn
beets carrots turnips and summer squashes and next two wrinkled
withered witch-looking old gossips in an antediluvian chaise drawn by
a horse of former generations and going to peddle out a lot of
huckleberries see there a man trundling a wheelbarrow-load of
lobsters and now a milk-cart rattles briskly onward covered with
green canvas and conveying the contributions of a whole herd of cows
in large tin canisters

but let all these pay their toll and pass here comes a spectacle that
causes the old toll-gatherer to smile benignantly as if the
travellers brought sunshine with them and lavished its gladsome
influence all along the road it is a barouche of the newest style
the varnished panels of which reflect the whole moving panorama of the
landscape and show a picture likewise of our friend with his visage
broadened so that his meditative smile is transformed to grotesque
merriment within sits a youth fresh as the summer morn and beside
him a young lady in white with white gloves upon her slender hands and
a white veil flowing down over her face but methinks her blushing
cheek burns through the snowy veil another white-robed virgin sits in
front and who are these on whom and on all that appertains to them
the dust of earth seems never to have settled two lovers whom the
priest has blessed this blessed morn and sent them forth with one of
the bride-maids on the matrimonial tour take my blessing too ye
happy ones may the sky not frown upon you nor clouds bedew you with
their chill and sullen rain may the hot sun kindle no fever in your
hearts may your whole life's pilgrimage be as blissful as this first
day's journey and its close be gladdened with even brighter
anticipations than those which hallow your bridal-night they pass
and ere the reflection of their joy has faded from his face another
spectacle throws a melancholy shadow over the spirit of the observing
man in a close carriage sits a fragile figure muffled carefully and
shrinking even from the mild breath of summer she leans against a
manly form and his arm enfolds her as if to guard his treasure from
some enemy let but a few weeks pass and when he shall strive to
embrace that loved one he will press only desolation to his heart

and now has morning gathered up her dewy pearls and fled away the sun
rolls blazing through the sky and cannot find a cloud to cool his
face with the horses toil sluggishly along the bridge and heave
their glistening sides in short quick pantings when the reins are
tightened at the toll-house glisten too the faces of the
travellers their garments are thickly bestrewn with dust their
whiskers and hair look hoary their throats are choked with the dusty
atmosphere which they have left behind them no air is stirring on the
road nature dares draw no breath lest she should inhale a stifling
cloud of dust a hot and dusty day cry the poor pilgrims as they
wipe their begrimed foreheads and woo the doubtful breeze which the
river bears along with it awful hot dreadful dusty answers the
sympathetic toll-gatherer they start again to pass through the fiery
furnace while he re-enters his cool hermitage and besprinkles it with
a pail of briny water from the stream beneath he thinks within
himself that the sun is not so fierce here as elsewhere and that the
gentle air doth not forget him in these sultry days yes old friend
and a quiet heart will make a dog-day temperate he hears a weary
footstep and perceives a traveller with pack and staff who sits down
upon the hospitable bench and removes the hat from his wet brow the
toll-gatherer administers a cup of cold water and discovering his
guest to be a man of homely sense he engages him in profitable talk
uttering the maxims of a philosophy which he has found in his own
soul but knows not how it came there and as the wayfarer makes ready
to resume his journey he tells him a sovereign remedy for blistered
feet

now comes the noontide hour of all the hours nearest akin to
midnight for each has its own calmness and repose soon however the
world begins to turn again upon its axis and it seems the busiest
epoch of the day when an accident impedes the march of sublunary
things the draw being lifted to permit the passage of a schooner
laden with wood from the eastern forests she sticks immovably right
athwart the bridge meanwhile on both sides of the chasm a throng of
impatient travellers fret and fume here are two sailors in a gig with
the top thrown back both puffing cigars and swearing all sorts of
forecastle oaths there in a smart chaise a dashingly-dressed
gentleman and lady he from a tailor's shop-board and she from a
milliner's back room the aristocrats of a summer afternoon and what
are the haughtiest of us but the ephemeral aristocrats of a summer's
day here is a tin-pedler whose glittering ware bedazzles all
beholders like a travelling meteor or opposition sun and on the other
side a seller of spruce beer which brisk liquor is confined in
several dozen of stone bottles here conic a party of ladies on
horseback in green ridings habits and gentlemen attendant and there
a flock of sheep for the market pattering over the bridge with a
multitude nous clatter of their little hoofs here a frenchman with a
hand-organ on his shoulder and there an itinerant swiss jeweller on
this side heralded by a blast of clarions and bugles appears a train
of wagons conveying all the wild beasts of a caravan and on that a
company of summer soldiers marching from village to village on a
festival campaign attended by the brass band now look at the
scene and it presents an emblem of the mysterious confusion the
apparently insolvable riddle in which individuals or the great world
itself seem often to be involved what miracle shall set all things
right again

but see the schooner has thrust her bulky carcase through the chasm
the draw descends horse and foot pass onward and leave the bridge
vacant from end to end and thus muses the toll-gatherer have i
found it with all stoppages even though the universe seemed to be at
a stand the sage old man

far westward now the reddening sun throws a broad sheet of splendor
across the flood and to the eyes of distant boatmen gleams brightly
among the timbers of the bridge strollers come from the town to quaff
the freshening breeze one or two let down long lines and haul up
flapping flounders or cunners or small cod or perhaps an eel others
and fair girls among them with the flush of the hot day still on
their cheeks bend over the railing and watch the heaps of seaweed
floating upward with the flowing tide the horses now tramp heavily
along the bridge and wistfully bethink them of their stables rest
rest thou weary world for to-morrow's round of toil and pleasure
will be as wearisome as to-day's has been yet both shall bear thee
onward a day's march of eternity now the old toll-gatherer looks
seaward and discerns the lighthouse kindling on a far island and the
stars too kindling in the sky as if but a little way beyond and
mingling reveries of heaven with remembrances of earth the whole
procession of mortal travellers all the dusty pilgrimage which he has
witnessed seems like a flitting show of phantoms for his thoughtful
soul to muse upon




the vision of the fountain


at fifteen i became a resident in a country village more than a
hundred miles from home the morning after my arrival a september
morning but warm and bright as any in july i rambled into a wood of
oaks with a few walnut trees intermixed forming the closest shade
above my head the ground was rocky uneven overgrown with bushes and
clumps of young saplings and traversed only by cattle-paths the track
which i chanced to follow led me to a crystal spring with a border of
grass as freshly green as on may morning and overshadowed by the limb
of a great oak one solitary sunbeam found its way down and played
like a goldfish in the water

from my childhood i have loved to gaze into a spring the water filled
a circular basin small but deep and set round with stones some of
which were covered with slimy moss the others naked and of variegated
hue reddish white and brown the bottom was covered with coarse
sand which sparkled in the lonely sunbeam and seemed to illuminate
the spring with an unborrowed light in one spot the gush of the water
violently agitated the sand but without obscuring the fountain or
breaking the glassiness of its surface it appeared as if some living
creature were about to emerge the naiad of the spring perhaps in
the shape of a beautiful young woman with a gown of filmy water-moss
a belt of rainbow-drops and a cold pure passionless countenance how
would the beholder shiver pleasantly yet fearfully to see her
sitting on one of the stones paddling her white feet in the ripples
and throwing up water to sparkle in the sun wherever she laid her
hands on grass and flowers they would immediately be moist as with
morning dew then would she set about her labors like a careful
housewife to clear the fountain of withered leaves and bits of slimy
wood and old acorns from the oaks above and grains of corn left by
cattle in drinking till the bright sand in the bright water were like
a treasury of diamonds but should the intruder approach too near he
would find only the drops of a summer shower glistening about the spot
where he had seen her

reclining on the border of grass where the dewy goddess should have
been i bent forward and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery
mirror they were the reflection of my own i looked again and lo
another face deeper in the fountain than my own image more distinct
in all the features yet faint as thought the vision had the aspect
of a fair young girl with locks of paly gold a mirthful expression
laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance
till it seemed just what a fountain would be if while dancing merrily
into the sunshine it should assume the shape of woman through the
dim rosiness of the cheeks i could see the brown leaves the slimy
twigs the acorns and the sparkling sand the solitary sunbeam was
diffused among the golden hair which melted into its faint brightness
and became a glory round that head so beautiful

my description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus
tenanted and how soon it was left desolate i breathed and there was
the face i held my breath and it was gone had it passed away or
faded into nothing i doubted whether it had ever been

my sweet readers what a dreamy and delicious hour did i spend where
that vision found and left me for a long time i sat perfectly still
waiting till it should reappear and fearful that the slightest
motion or even the flutter of my breath might frighten it away thus
have i often started from a pleasant dream and then kept quiet in
hopes to wile it back deep were my musings as to the race and
attributes of that ethereal being had i created her was she the
daughter of my fancy akin to those strange shapes which peep under
the lids of children's eyes and did her beauty gladden me for that
one moment and then die or was she a water-nymph within the fountain
or fairy or woodland goddess peeping over my shoulder or the ghost of
some forsaken maid who had drowned herself for love or in good
truth had a lovely girl with a warm heart and lips that would bear
pressure stolen softly behind me and thrown her image into the spring

i watched and waited but no vision came again i departed but with a
spell upon me which drew me back that same afternoon to the haunted
spring there was the water gushing the sand sparkling and the
sunbeam glimmering there the vision was not but only a great frog
the hermit of that solitude who immediately withdrew his speckled
snout and made himself invisible all except a pair of long
legs beneath a stone methought he had a devilish look i could have
slain him as an enchanter who kept the mysterious beauty imprisoned in
the fountain

sad and heavy i was returning to the village between me and the
church-spire rose a little hill and on its summit a group of trees
insulated from all the rest of the wood with their own share of
radiance hovering on them from the west and their own solitary shadow
falling to the east the afternoon being far declined the sunshine
was almost pensive and the shade almost cheerful glory and gloom were
mingled in the placid light as if the spirits of the day and evening
had met in friendship under those trees and found themselves akin i
was admiring the picture when the shape of a young girl emerged from
behind the clump of oaks my heart knew her it was the vision but so
distant and ethereal did she seem so unmixed with earth so imbued
with the pensive glory of the spot where she was standing that my
spirit sunk within me sadder than before how could i ever reach her

while i gazed a sudden shower came pattering down upon the leaves in
a moment the air was full of brightness each raindrop catching a
portion of sunlight as it fell and the whole gentle shower appearing
like a mist just substantial enough to bear the burden of radiance a
rainbow vivid as niagara's was painted in the air its southern limb
came down before the group of trees and enveloped the fair vision as
if the hues of heaven were the only garment for her beauty when the
rainbow vanished she who had seemed a part of it was no longer there
was her existence absorbed in nature's loveliest phenomenon and did
her pure frame dissolve away in the varied light yet i would not
despair of her return for robed in the rainbow she was the emblem
of hope

thus did the vision leave me and many a doleful day succeeded to the
parting moment by the spring and in the wood and on the hill and
through the village at dewy sunrise burning noon and at that magic
hour of sunset when she had vanished from my sight i sought her but
in vain weeks came and went months rolled away and she appeared not
in them i imparted my mystery to none but wandered to and fro or sat
in solitude like one that had caught a glimpse of heaven and could
take no more joy on earth i withdrew into an inner world where my
thoughts lived and breathed and the vision in the midst of them
without intending it i became at once the author and hero of a
romance conjuring up rivals imagining events the actions of others
and my own and experiencing every change of passion till jealousy
and despair had their end in bliss oh had i the burning fancy of my
early youth with manhood's colder gift the power of expression your
hearts sweet ladies should flutter at my tale

in the middle of january i was summoned home the day before my
departure visiting the spots which had been hallowed by the vision i
found that the spring had a frozen bosom and nothing but the snow and
a glare of winter sunshine on the hill of the rainbow let me hope
thought i or my heart will be as icy as the fountain and the whole
world as desolate as this snowy hill most of the day was spent in
preparing for the journey which was to commence at four o'clock the
next morning about an hour after supper when all was in readiness i
descended from my chamber to the sitting-room to take leave of the old
clergyman and his family with whom i had been an inmate a gust of
wind blew out my lamp as i passed through the entry

according to their invariable custom so pleasant a one when the fire
blazes cheerfully the family were sitting in the parlor with no other
light than what came from the hearth as the good clergyman's scanty
stipend compelled him to use all sorts of economy the foundation of
his fires was always a large heap of tan or ground bark which would
smoulder away from morning till night with a dull warmth and no flame
this evening the heap of tan was newly put on and surmounted with
three sticks of red oak full of moisture and a few pieces of dry pine
that had not yet kindled there was no light except the little that
came sullenly from two half-burnt brands without even glimmering on
the andirons but i knew the position of the old minister's arm-chair
and also where his wife sat with her knitting-work and how to avoid
his two daughters one a stout country lass and the other a
consumptive girl groping through the gloom i found my own place next
to that of the son a learned collegian who had come home to keep
school in the village during the winter vacation i noticed that there
was less room than usual to-night between the collegian's chair and
mine

as people are always taciturn in the dark not a word was said for
some time after my entrance nothing broke the stillness but the
regular click of the matron's knitting-needles at times the fire
threw out a brief and dusky gleam which twinkled on the old man's
glasses and hovered doubtfully round our circle but was far too faint
to portray the individuals who composed it were we not like ghosts
dreamy as the scene was might it not be a type of the mode in which
departed people who had known and loved each other here would hold
communion in eternity we were aware of each other's presence not by
sight nor sound nor touch but by an inward consciousness would it
not be so among the dead

the silence was interrupted by the consumptive daughter addressing a
remark to some one in the circle whom she called rachel her tremulous
and decayed accents were answered by a single word but in a voice
that made me start and bend toward the spot whence it had proceeded
had i ever heard that sweet low tone if not why did it rouse up so
many old recollections or mockeries of such the shadows of things
familiar yet unknown and fill my mind with confused images of her
features who had spoken though buried in the gloom of the parlor
whom had my heart recognized that it throbbed so i listened to catch
her gentle breathing and strove by the intensity of my gaze to
picture forth a shape where none was visible

suddenly the dry pine caught the fire blazed up with a ruddy glow
and where the darkness had been there was she the vision of the
fountain a spirit of radiance only she had vanished with the rainbow
and appeared again in the firelight perhaps to flicker with the blaze
and be gone vet her cheek was rosy and lifelike and her features in
the bright warmth of the room were even sweeter and tenderer than my
recollection of them she knew me the mirthful expression that had
laughed in her eyes and dimpled over her countenance when i beheld her
faint beauty in the fountain was laughing and dimpling there now one
moment our glance mingled the next down rolled the heap of tan upon
the kindled wood and darkness snatched away that daughter of the
light and gave her back to me no more

fair ladies there is nothing more to tell must the simple mystery be
revealed then that rachel was the daughter of the village squire and
had left home for a boarding-school the morning after i arrived and
returned the day before my departure if i transformed her to an
angel it is what every youthful lover does for his mistress therein
consists the essence of my story but slight the change sweet maids
to make angels of yourselves




fancy's show-box

a morality


what is guilt a stain upon the soul and it is a point of vast
interest whether the soul may contract such stains in all their depth
and flagrancy from deeds which may have been plotted and resolved
upon but which physically have never had existence must the fleshly
hand and visible frame of man set its seal to the evil designs of the
soul in order to give them their entire validity against the sinner
or while none but crimes perpetrated are cognizable before an earthly
tribunal will guilty thoughts of which guilty deeds are no more than
shadows will these draw down the full weight of a condemning
sentence in the supreme court of eternity in the solitude of a
midnight chamber or in a desert afar from men or in a church while the
body is kneeling the soul may pollute itself even with those crimes
which we are accustomed to deem altogether carnal if this be true it
is a fearful truth

let us illustrate the subject by an imaginary example a venerable
gentleman one mr smith who had long been regarded as a pattern of
moral excellence was warming his aged blood with a glass or two of
generous wine his children being gone forth about their worldly
business and his grandchildren at school he sat alone in a deep
luxurious arm-chair with his feet beneath a richly-carved mahogany
table some old people have a dread of solitude and when better
company may not be had rejoice even to hear the quiet breathing of a
babe asleep upon the carpet but mr smith whose silver hair was the
bright symbol of a life unstained except by such spots as are
inseparable from human nature he had no need of a babe to protect him
by its purity nor of a grown person to stand between him and his own
soul nevertheless either manhood must converse with age or
womanhood must soothe him with gentle cares or infancy must sport
around his chair or his thoughts will stray into the misty region of
the past and the old man be chill and sad wine will not always cheer
him

such might have been the case with mr smith when through the
brilliant medium of his glass of old madeira he beheld three figures
entering the room these were fancy who had assumed the garb and
aspect of an itinerant showman with a box of pictures on her back
and memory in the likeness of a clerk with a pen behind her ear an
inkhorn at her buttonhole and a huge manuscript volume beneath her
arm and lastly behind the other two a person shrouded in a dusky
mantle which concealed both face and form but mr smith had a shrewd
idea that it was conscience how kind of fancy memory and conscience
to visit the old gentleman just as he was beginning to imagine that
the wine had neither so bright a sparkle nor so excellent a flavor as
when himself and the liquor were less aged through the dim length of
the apartment where crimson curtains muffled the glare of sunshine
and created a rich obscurity the three guests drew near the
silver-haired old man memory with a finger between the leaves of her
huge volume placed herself at his right hand conscience with her
face still hidden in the dusky mantle took her station on the left
so as to be next his heart while fancy set down her picture-box upon
the table with the magnifying-glass convenient to his eye

we can sketch merely the outlines of two or three out of the many
pictures which at the pulling of a string successively peopled the box
with the semblances of living scenes one was a moonlight picture in
the background a lowly dwelling and in front partly shadowed by a
tree yet besprinkled with flakes of radiance two youthful figures
male and female the young man stood with folded arms a haughty smile
upon his lip and a gleam of triumph in his eye as he glanced downward
at the kneeling girl she was almost prostrate at his feet evidently
sinking under a weight of shame and anguish which hardly allowed her
to lift her clasped hands in supplication her eyes she could not
lift but neither her agony nor the lovely features on which it was
depicted nor the slender grace of the form which it convulsed
appeared to soften the obduracy of the young man he was the
personification of triumphant scorn

now strange to say as old mr smith peeped through the
magnifying-glass which made the objects start out from the canvas
with magical deception he began to recognize the farmhouse the tree
and both the figures of the picture the young man in times long past
had often met his gaze within the looking-glass the girl was the very
image of his first love his cottage-love his martha burroughs mr
smith was scandalized oh vile and slanderous picture he exclaims
when have i triumphed over ruined innocence was not martha wedded in
her teens to david tomkins who won her girlish love and long enjoyed
her affection as a wife and ever since his death she has lived a
reputable widow

meantime memory was turning over the leaves of her volume rustling
them to and fro with uncertain fingers until among the earlier pages
she found one which had reference to this picture she reads it close
to the old gentleman's ear it is a record merely of sinful thought
which never was embodied in an act but while memory is reading
conscience unveils her face and strikes a dagger to the heart of mr
smith though not a death-blow the torture was extreme

the exhibition proceeded one after another fancy displayed her
pictures all of which appeared to have been painted by some malicious
artist on purpose to vex mr smith not a shadow of proof could have
been adduced in any earthly court that he was guilty of the slightest
of those sins which were thus made to stare him in the face in one
scene there was a table set out with several bottles and glasses half
filled with wine which threw back the dull ray of an expiring lamp
there had been mirth and revelry until the hand of the clock stood
just at midnight when murder stepped between the boon-companions a
young man had fallen on the floor and lay stone dead with a ghastly
wound crushed into his temple while over him with a delirium of
mingled rage and horror in his countenance stood the youthful
likeness of mr smith the murdered youth wore the features of edward
spencer what does this rascal of a painter mean cries mr smith
provoked beyond all patience edward spencer was my earliest and
dearest friend true to me as i to him through more than half a
century neither i nor any other ever murdered him was he not alive
within five years and did he not in token of our long friendship
bequeath me his gold-headed cane and a mourning-ring

again had memory been turning over her volume and fixed at length
upon so confused a page that she surely must have scribbled it when
she was tipsy the purport was however that while mr smith and
edward spencer were heating their young blood with wine a quarrel had
flashed up between them and mr smith in deadly wrath had flung a
bottle at spencer's head true it missed its aim and merely smashed a
looking-glass and the next morning when the incident was imperfectly
remembered they had shaken hands with a hearty laugh yet again
while memory was reading conscience unveiled her face struck a
dagger to the heart of mr smith and quelled his remonstrance with her
iron frown the pain was quite excruciating

some of the pictures had been painted with so doubtful a touch and
in colors so faint and pale that the subjects could barely be
conjectured a dull semi-transparent mist had been thrown over the
surface of the canvas into which the figures seemed to vanish while
the eye sought most earnestly to fix them but in every scene however
dubiously portrayed mr smith was invariably haunted by his own
lineaments at various ages as in a dusty mirror after poring several
minutes over one of these blurred and almost indistinguishable
pictures he began to see that the painter had intended to represent
him now in the decline of life as stripping the clothes from the
backs of three half-starved children really this puzzles me quoth
mr smith with the irony of conscious rectitude asking pardon of
the painter i pronounce him a fool as well as a scandalous knave a
man of my standing in the world to be robbing little children of their
clothes ridiculous

but while he spoke memory had searched her fatal volume and found a
page which with her sad calm voice she poured into his ear it was not
altogether inapplicable to the misty scene it told how mr smith had
been grievously tempted by many devilish sophistries on the ground of
a legal quibble to commence a lawsuit against three orphan-children
joint-heirs to a considerable estate fortunately before he was quite
decided his claims had turned out nearly as devoid of law as justice
as memory ceased to read conscience again thrust aside her mantle and
would have struck her victim with the envenomed dagger only that he
struggled and clasped his hands before his heart even then however
he sustained an ugly gash

why should we follow fancy through the whole series of those awful
pictures painted by an artist of wondrous power and terrible
acquaintance with the secret soul they embodied the ghosts of all the
never-perpetrated sins that had glided through the lifetime of mr
smith and could such beings of cloudy fantasy so near akin to
nothingness give valid evidence against him at the day of judgment
be that the case or not there is reason to believe that one truly
penitential tear would have washed away each hateful picture and left
the canvas white as snow but mr smith at a prick of conscience too
keen to be endured bellowed aloud with impatient agony and suddenly
discovered that his three guests were gone there he sat alone a
silver-haired and highly-venerated old man in the rich gloom of the
crimsoned-curtained room with no box of pictures on the table but
only a decanter of most excellent madeira yet his heart still seemed
to fester with the venom of the dagger

nevertheless the unfortunate old gentleman might have argued the
matter with conscience and alleged many reasons wherefore she should
not smite him so pitilessly were we to take up his cause it should
be somewhat in the following fashion a scheme of guilt till it be
put in execution greatly resembles a train of incidents in a
projected tale the latter in order to produce a sense of reality in
the reader's mind must be conceived with such proportionate strength
by the author as to seem in the glow of fancy more like truth past
present or to come than purely fiction the prospective sinner on
the other hand weaves his plot of crime but seldom or never feels a
perfect certainty that it will be executed there is a dreaminess
diffused about his thoughts in a dream as it were he strikes the
death-blow into his victim's heart and starts to find an indelible
blood-stain on his hand thus a novel-writer or a dramatist in
creating a villain of romance and fitting him with evil deeds and the
villain of actual life in projecting crimes that will be perpetrated
may almost meet each other halfway between reality and fancy it is
not until the crime is accomplished that guilt clenches its gripe upon
the guilty heart and claims it for his own then and not before sin
is actually felt and acknowledged and if unaccompanied by repentance
grows a thousandfold more virulent by its self-consciousness be it
considered also that men often overestimate their capacity for evil
at a distance while its attendant circumstances do not press upon
their notice and its results are dimly seen they can bear to
contemplate it they may take the steps which lead to crime impelled
by the same sort of mental action as in working out a mathematical
problem yet be powerless with compunction at the final moment they
knew not what deed it was that they deemed themselves resolved to do
in truth there is no such thing in man's nature as a settled and full
resolve either for good or evil except at the very moment of
execution let us hope therefore that all the dreadful consequences
of sin will not be incurred unless the act have set its seal upon the
thought

yet with the slight fancy-work which we have framed some sad and
awful truths are interwoven man must not disclaim his brotherhood
even with the guiltiest since though his hand be clean his heart
has surely been polluted by the flitting phantoms of iniquity he must
feel that when he shall knock at the gate of heaven no semblance of an
unspotted life can entitle him to entrance there penitence must kneel
and mercy come from the footstool of the throne or that golden gate
will never open




dr heidegger's experiment


that very singular man old dr heidegger once invited four venerable
friends to meet him in his study there were three white-bearded
gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne and a
withered gentlewoman whose name was the widow wycherly they were all
melancholy old creatures who had been unfortunate in life and whose
greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their
graves mr medbourne in the vigor of his age had been a prosperous
merchant but had lost his all by a frantic speculation and was now
little better than a mendicant colonel killigrew had wasted his best
years and his health and substance in the pursuit of sinful pleasures
which had given birth to a brood of pains such as the gout and divers
other torments of soul and body mr gascoigne was a ruined
politician a man of evil fame or at least had been so till time
had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation and made
him obscure instead of infamous as for the widow wycherly tradition
tells us that she was a great beauty in her day but for a long while
past she had lived in deep seclusion on account of certain scandalous
stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her it is
a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old
gentlemen mr medbourne colonel killigrew and mr gascoigne were
early lovers of the widow wycherly and had once been on the point of
cutting each other's throats for her sake and before proceeding
farther i will merely hint that dr heidegger and all his four guests
were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves as is not
infrequently the case with old people when worried either by present
troubles or woeful recollections

my dear old friends said dr heidegger motioning them to be
seated i am desirous of your assistance in one of those little
experiments with which i amuse myself here in my study

if all stories were true dr heidegger's study must have been a very
curious place it was a dim old-fashioned chamber festooned with
cobwebs and besprinkled with antique dust around the walls stood
several oaken bookcases the lower shelves of which were filled with
rows of gigantic folios and black-letter quartos and the upper with
little parchment-covered duodecimos over the central bookcase was a
bronze bust of hippocrates with which according to some authorities
dr heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult
cases of his practice in the obscurest corner of the room stood a
tall and narrow oaken closet with its door ajar within which
doubtfully appeared a skeleton between two of the bookcases hung a
looking-glass presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished
gilt frame among many wonderful stories related of this mirror it
was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor's deceased patients
dwelt within its verge and would stare him in the face whenever he
looked thitherward the opposite side of the chamber was ornamented
with the full-length portrait of a young lady arrayed in the faded
magnificence of silk satin and brocade and with a visage as faded as
her dress above half a century ago dr heidegger had been on the
point of marriage with this young lady but being affected with some
slight disorder she had swallowed one of her lover's prescriptions
and died on the bridal-evening the greatest curiosity of the study
remains to be mentioned it was a ponderous folio volume bound in
black leather with massive silver clasps there were no letters on
the back and nobody could tell the title of the book but it was well
known to be a book of magic and once when a chambermaid had lifted
it merely to brush away the dust the skeleton had rattled in its
closet the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the
floor and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror
while the brazen head of hippocrates frowned and said forbear

such was dr heidegger's study on the summer afternoon of our tale a
small round table as black as ebony stood in the centre of the room
sustaining a cut-glass vase of beautiful form and elaborate
workmanship the sunshine came through the window between the heavy
festoons of two faded damask curtains and fell directly across this
vase so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen
visages of the five old people who sat around four champagne-glasses
were also on the table

my dear old friends repeated dr heidegger may i reckon on your
aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment

now dr heidegger was a very strange old gentleman whose eccentricity
had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories some of these
fables to my shame be it spoken might possibly be traced back to
mine own veracious self and if any passages of the present tale
should startle the reader's faith i must be content to bear the
stigma of a fiction-monger

when the doctor's four guests heard him talk of his proposed
experiment they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of
a mouse in an air-pump or the examination of a cobweb by the
microscope or some similar nonsense with which he was constantly in
the habit of pestering his intimates but without waiting for a reply
dr heidegger hobbled across the chamber and returned with the same
ponderous folio bound in black leather which common report affirmed to
be a book of magic undoing the silver clasps he opened the volume
and took from among its black-letter pages a rose or what was once a
rose though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one
brownish hue and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in
the doctor's hands

this rose said dr heidegger with a sigh this same withered and
crumbling flower blossomed five and fifty years ago it was given me
by sylvia ward whose portrait hangs yonder and i meant to wear it in
my bosom at our wedding five and fifty years it has been treasured
between the leaves of this old volume now would you deem it possible
that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again

nonsense said the widow wycherly with a peevish toss of her head
you might as well ask whether an old woman's wrinkled face could ever
bloom again

see answered dr heidegger he uncovered the vase and threw the
faded rose into the water which it contained at first it lay lightly
on the surface of the fluid appearing to imbibe none of its moisture
soon however a singular change began to be visible the crushed and
dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson as if
the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber the slender stalk
and twigs of foliage became green and there was the rose of half a
century looking as fresh as when sylvia ward had first given it to
her lover it was scarcely full-blown for some of its delicate red
leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom within which two or
three dewdrops were sparkling

that is certainly a very pretty deception said the doctor's
friends carelessly however for they had witnessed greater miracles
at a conjurer's show pray how was it effected

did you never hear of the fountain of youth asked dr heidegger
which ponce de leon the spanish adventurer went in search of two or
three centuries ago

but did ponce de leon ever find it said the widow wycherly

no answered dr heidegger for he never sought it in the right
place the famous fountain of youth if i am rightly informed is
situated in the southern part of the floridian peninsula not far from
lake macaco its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias
which though numberless centuries old have been kept as fresh as
violets by the virtues of this wonderful water an acquaintance of
mine knowing my curiosity in such matters has sent me what you see
in the vase

ahem said colonel killigrew who believed not a word of the
doctor's story and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human
frame

you shall judge for yourself my dear colonel replied dr
heidegger and all of you my respected friends are welcome to so
much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth
for my own part having had much trouble in growing old i am in no
hurry to grow young again with your permission therefore i will
merely watch the progress of the experiment

while he spoke dr heidegger had been filling the four
champagne-glasses with the water of the fountain of youth it was
apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas for little bubbles
were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses and bursting
in silvery spray at the surface as the liquor diffused a pleasant
perfume the old people doubted not that it possessed cordial and
comfortable properties and though utter sceptics as to its
rejuvenescent power they were inclined to swallow it at once but dr
heidegger besought them to stay a moment

before you drink my respectable old friends said he it would be
well that with the experience of a lifetime to direct you you should
draw up a few general rules for your guidance in passing a second time
through the perils of youth think what a sin and shame it would be
if with your peculiar advantages you should not become patterns of
virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age

the doctor's four venerable friends made him no answer except by a
feeble and tremulous laugh so very ridiculous was the idea that
knowing how closely repentance treads behind the steps of error they
should ever go astray again

drink then said the doctor bowing i rejoice that i have so well
selected the subjects of my experiment

with palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips the liquor
if it really possessed such virtues as dr heidegger imputed to it
could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more
woefully they looked as if they had never known what youth or
pleasure was but had been the offspring of nature's dotage and
always the gray decrepit sapless miserable creatures who now sat
stooping round the doctor's table without life enough in their souls
or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again
they drank off the water and replaced their glasses on the table

assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of
the party not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of
generous wine together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine
brightening over all their visages at once there was a healthful
suffusion on their cheeks instead of the ashen hue that had made them
look so corpse-like they gazed at one another and fancied that some
magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad
inscriptions which father time had been so long engraving on their
brows the widow wycherly adjusted her cap for she felt almost like a
woman again

give us more of this wondrous water cried they eagerly we are
younger but we are still too old quick give us more

patience patience quoth dr heidegger who sat watching the
experiment with philosophic coolness you have been a long time
growing old surely you might be content to grow young in half an
hour but the water is at your service again he filled their glasses
with the liquor of youth enough of which still remained in the vase
to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own
grandchildren

while the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim the doctor's four
guests snatched their glasses from the table and swallowed the
contents at a single gulp was it delusion even while the draught was
passing down their throats it seemed to have wrought a change on their
whole systems their eyes grew clear and bright a dark shade deepened
among their silvery locks they sat around the table three gentlemen
of middle age and a woman hardly beyond her buxom prime

my dear widow you are charming cried colonel killigrew whose eyes
had been fixed upon her face while the shadows of age were flitting
from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak

the fair widow knew of old that colonel killigrew's compliments were
not always measured by sober truth so she started up and ran to the
mirror still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet
her gaze

meanwhile the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that
the water of the fountain of youth possessed some intoxicating
qualities unless indeed their exhilaration of spirits were merely a
lightsome dizziness caused by the sudden removal of the weight of
years mr gascoigne's mind seemed to run on political topics but
whether relating to the past present or future could not easily be
determined since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these
fifty years now he rattled forth full-throated sentences about
patriotism national glory and the people's right now he muttered
some perilous stuff or other in a sly and doubtful whisper so
cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the
secret and now again he spoke in measured accents and a
deeply-deferential tone as if a royal ear were listening to his
well-turned periods colonel killigrew all this time had been trolling
forth a jolly bottle-song and ringing his glass in symphony with the
chorus while his eyes wandered toward the buxom figure of the widow
wycherly on the other side of the table mr medbourne was involved
in a calculation of dollars and cents with which was strangely
intermingled a project for supplying the east indies with ice by
harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs as for the widow
wycherly she stood before the mirror courtesying and simpering to her
own image and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all
the world besides she thrust her face close to the glass to see
whether some long-remembered wrinkle or crow's-foot had indeed
vanished she examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from
her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside at last
turning briskly away she came with a sort of dancing step to the
table

my dear old doctor cried she pray favor me with another glass

certainly my dear madam certainly replied the complaisant doctor
see i have already filled the glasses

there in fact stood the four glasses brimful of this wonderful
water the delicate spray of which as it effervesced from the
surface resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds

it was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than
ever but a mild and moonlike splendor gleamed from within the vase
and rested alike on the four guests and on the doctor's venerable
figure he sat in a high-backed elaborately-carved oaken arm-chair
with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very
father time whose power had never been disputed save by this fortunate
company even while quaffing the third draught of the fountain of
youth they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious
visage but the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot
through their veins they were now in the happy prime of youth age
with its miserable train of cares and sorrows and diseases was
remembered only as the trouble of a dream from which they had joyously
awoke the fresh gloss of the soul so early lost and without which
the world's successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded
pictures again threw its enchantment over all their prospects they
felt like new-created beings in a new-created universe

we are young we are young they cried exultingly

youth like the extremity of age had effaced the strongly-marked
characteristics of middle life and mutually assimilated them all they
were a group of merry youngsters almost maddened with the exuberant
frolicsomeness of their years the most singular effect of their
gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which
they had so lately been the victims they laughed loudly at their
old-fashioned attire the wide-skirted coats and flapped waistcoats of
the young men and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl one
limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather one set a pair of
spectacles astride of his nose and pretended to pore over the
black-letter pages of the book of magic a third seated himself in an
arm-chair and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of dr
heidegger then all shouted mirthfully and leaped about the room

the widow wycherly if so fresh a damsel could be called a
widow tripped up to the doctor's chair with a mischievous merriment
in her rosy face

doctor you dear old soul cried she get up and dance with me
and then the four young people laughed louder than ever to think what
a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut

pray excuse me answered the doctor quietly i am old and
rheumatic and my dancing-days were over long ago but either of these
gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner

dance with me clara cried colonel killigrew

no no i will be her partner shouted mr gascoigne

she promised me her hand fifty years ago exclaimed mr medbourne

they all gathered round her one caught both her hands in his
passionate grasp another threw his arm about her waist the third
buried his hand among the glossy curls that clustered beneath the
widow's cap blushing panting struggling chiding laughing her
warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns she strove to
disengage herself yet still remained in their triple embrace never
was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship with bewitching
beauty for the prize yet by a strange deception owing to the
duskiness of the chamber and the antique dresses which they still
wore the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the
three old gray withered grand-sires ridiculously contending for the
skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam but they were young their
burning passions proved them so

inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girl-widow who neither
granted nor quite withheld her favors the three rivals began to
interchange threatening glances still keeping hold of the fair prize
they grappled fiercely at one another's throats as they struggled to
and fro the table was overturned and the vase dashed into a thousand
fragments the precious water of youth flowed in a bright stream
across the floor moistening the wings of a butterfly which grown old
in the decline of summer had alighted there to die the insect
fluttered lightly through the chamber and settled on the snowy head of
dr heidegger

come come gentlemen come madam wycherly exclaimed the doctor
i really must protest against this riot

they stood still and shivered for it seemed as if gray time were
calling them back from their sunny youth far down into the chill and
darksome vale of years they looked at old dr heidegger who sat in
his carved armchair holding the rose of half a century which he had
rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase at the motion
of his hand the four rioters resumed their seats the more readily
because their violent exertions had wearied them youthful though they
were

my poor sylvia's rose ejaculated dr heidegger holding it in the
light of the sunset clouds it appears to be fading again

and so it was even while the party were looking at it the flower
continued to shrivel up till it became as dry and fragile as when the
doctor had first thrown it into the vase he shook off the few drops
of moisture which clung to its petals

i love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness observed he
pressing the withered rose to his withered lips

while he spoke the butterfly fluttered down from the doctor's snowy
head and fell upon the floor his guests shivered again a strange
dullness whether of the body or spirit they could not tell was
creeping gradually over them all they gazed at one another and
fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm and left a
deepening furrow where none had been before was it an illusion had
the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space and were
they now four aged people sitting with their old friend dr heidegger

are we grown old again so soon cried they dolefully

in truth they had the water of youth possessed merely a virtue more
transient than that of wine the delirium which it created had
effervesced away yes they were old again with a shuddering impulse
that showed her a woman still the widow clasped her skinny hands
before her face and wished that the coffin-lid were over it since it
could be no longer beautiful

yes friends ye are old again said dr heidegger and lo the
water of youth is all lavished on the ground well i bemoan it not
for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep i would not stoop to
bathe my lips in it no though its delirium were for years instead of
moments such is the lesson ye have taught me

but the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves
they resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to florida and quaff at
morning noon and night from the fountain of youth

howe's masquerade


one afternoon last summer while walking along washington street my
eye was attracted by a sign-board protruding over a narrow archway
nearly opposite the old south church the sign represented the front
of a stately edifice which was designated as the old province house
kept by thomas waite i was glad to be thus reminded of a purpose
long entertained of visiting and rambling over the mansion of the old
royal governors of massachusetts and entering the arched passage
which penetrated through the middle of a brick row of shops a few
steps transported me from the busy heart of modern boston into a small
and secluded court-yard one side of this space was occupied by the
square front of the province house three stories high and surmounted
by a cupola on the top of which a gilded indian was discernible with
his bow bent and his arrow on the string as if aiming at the
weathercock on the spire of the old south the figure has kept this
attitude for seventy years or more ever since good deacon drowne a
cunning carver of wood first stationed him on his long sentinel's
watch over the city

the province house is constructed of brick which seems recently to
have been overlaid with a coat of light-colored paint a flight of red
freestone steps fenced in by a balustrade of curiously wrought iron
ascends from the court-yard to the spacious porch over which is a
balcony with an iron balustrade of similar pattern and workmanship to
that beneath these letters and figures ps are wrought
into the ironwork of the balcony and probably express the date of the
edifice with the initials of its founder's name

a wide door with double leaves admitted me into the hall or entry on
the right of which is the entrance to the bar-room it was in this
apartment i presume that the ancient governors held their levees
with vice-regal pomp surrounded by the military men the counsellors
the judges and other officers of the crown while all the loyalty of
the province thronged to do them honor but the room in its present
condition cannot boast even of faded magnificence the panelled
wainscot is covered with dingy paint and acquires a duskier hue from
the deep shadow into which the province house is thrown by the brick
block that shuts it in from washington street a ray of sunshine never
visits this apartment any more than the glare of the festal torches
which have been extinguished from the era of the revolution the most
venerable and ornamental object is a chimney-piece set round with
dutch tiles of blue-figured china representing scenes from scripture
and for aught i know the lady of pownall or bernard may have sat
beside this fireplace and told her children the story of each blue
tile a bar in modern style well replenished with decanters bottles
cigar-boxes and network bags of lemons and provided with a beer-pump
and a soda-fount extends along one side of the room

at my entrance an elderly person was smacking his lips with a zest
which satisfied me that the cellars of the province house still hold
good liquor though doubtless of other vintages than were quaffed by
the old governors after sipping a glass of port-sangaree prepared by
the skilful hands of mr thomas waite i besought that worthy
successor and representative of so many historic personages to conduct
me over their time-honored mansion he readily complied but to
confess the truth i was forced to draw strenuously upon my
imagination in order to find aught that was interesting in a house
which without its historic associations would have seemed merely
such a tavern as is usually favored by the custom of decent city
boarders and old-fashioned country gentlemen the chambers which were
probably spacious in former times are now cut up by partitions and
subdivided into little nooks each affording scanty room for the
narrow bed and chair and dressing-table of a single lodger the great
staircase however may be termed without much hyperbole a feature
of grandeur and magnificence it winds through the midst of the house
by flights of broad steps each flight terminating in a square
landing-place whence the ascent is continued toward the cupola a
carved balustrade freshly painted in the lower stories but growing
dingier as we ascend borders the staircase with its quaintly twisted
and intertwined pillars from top to bottom up these stairs the
military boots or perchance the gouty shoes of many a governor have
trodden as the wearers mounted to the cupola which afforded them so
wide a view over their metropolis and the surrounding country the
cupola is an octagon with several windows and a door opening upon the
roof from this station as i pleased myself with imagining gage may
have beheld his disastrous victory on bunker hill unless one of the
tri-mountains intervened and howe have marked the approaches of
washington's besieging army although the buildings since erected in
the vicinity have shut out almost every object save the steeple of the
old south which seems almost within arm's length descending from the
cupola i paused in the garret to observe the ponderous white-oak
framework so much more massive than the frames of modern houses and
thereby resembling an antique skeleton the brick walls the materials
of which were imported from holland and the timbers of the mansion
are still as sound as ever but the floors and other interior parts
being greatly decayed it is contemplated to gut the whole and build a
new house within the ancient frame-and brickwork among other
inconveniences of the present edifice mine host mentioned that any
jar or motion was apt to shake down the dust of ages out of the
ceiling of one chamber upon the floor of that beneath it

we stepped forth from the great front window into the balcony where in
old times it was doubtless the custom of the king's representative to
show himself to a loyal populace requiting their huzzas and tossed-up
hats with stately bendings of his dignified person in those days the
front of the province house looked upon the street and the whole site
now occupied by the brick range of stores as well as the present
court-yard was laid out in grass-plats overshadowed by trees and
bordered by a wrought-iron fence now the old aristocratic edifice
hides its time-worn visage behind an upstart modern building at one
of the back windows i observed some pretty tailoresses sewing and
chatting and laughing with now and then a careless glance toward the
balcony descending thence we again entered the bar-room where the
elderly gentleman above mentioned the smack of whose lips had spoken
so favorably for mr waite's good liquor was still lounging in his
chair he seemed to be if not a lodger at least a familiar visitor
of the house who might be supposed to have his regular score at the
bar his summer seat at the open window and his prescriptive corner at
the winter's fireside being of a sociable aspect i ventured to
address him with a remark calculated to draw forth his historical
reminiscences if any such were in his mind and it gratified me to
discover that between memory and tradition the old gentleman was
really possessed of some very pleasant gossip about the province
house the portion of his talk which chiefly interested me was the
outline of the following legend he professed to have received it at
one or two removes from an eye-witness but this derivation together
with the lapse of time must have afforded opportunities for many
variations of the narrative so that despairing of literal and
absolute truth i have not scrupled to make such further changes as
seemed conducive to the reader's profit and delight

 

at one of the entertainments given at the province-house during the
latter part of the siege of boston there passed a scene which has
never yet been satisfactorily explained the officers of the british
army and the loyal gentry of the province most of whom were collected
within the beleaguered town had been invited to a masqued ball for
it was the policy for sir william howe to hide the distress and danger
of the period and the desperate aspect of the siege under an
ostentation of festivity the spectacle of this evening if the oldest
members of the provincial court circle might be believed was the most
gay and gorgeous affair that had occurred in the annals of the
government the brilliantly-lighted apartments were thronged with
figures that seemed to have stepped from the dark canvas of historic
portraits or to have flitted forth from the magic pages of romance or
at least to have flown hither from one of the london theatres without
a change of garments steeled knights of the conquest bearded
statesmen of queen elizabeth and high-ruffed ladies of her court were
mingled with characters of comedy such as a parti-colored merry
andrew jingling his cap and bells a falstaff almost as provocative of
laughter as his prototype and a don quixote with a bean-pole for a
lance and a pot-lid for a shield

but the broadest merriment was excited by a group of figures
ridiculously dressed in old regimentals which seemed to have been
purchased at a military rag-fair or pilfered from some receptacle of
the cast-off clothes of both the french and british armies portions
of their attire had probably been worn at the siege of louisburg and
the coats of most recent cut might have been rent and tattered by
sword ball or bayonet as long ago as wolfe's victory one of these
worthies a tall lank figure brandishing a rusty sword of immense
longitude purported to be no less a personage than general george
washington and the other principal officers of the american army
such as gates lee putnam schuyler ward and heath were represented
by similar scarecrows an interview in the mock-heroic style between
the rebel warriors and the british commander-in-chief was received
with immense applause which came loudest of all from the loyalists of
the colony

there was one of the guests however who stood apart eying these
antics sternly and scornfully at once with a frown and a bitter smile
it was an old man formerly of high station and great repute in the
province and who had been a very famous soldier in his day some
surprise had been expressed that a person of colonel joliffe's known
whig principles though now too old to take an active part in the
contest should have remained in boston during the siege and
especially that he should consent to show himself in the mansion of
sir william howe but thither he had come with a fair granddaughter
under his arm and there amid all the mirth and buffoonery stood
this stern old figure the best-sustained character in the masquerade
because so well representing the antique spirit of his native land
the other guests affirmed that colonel joliffe's black puritanical
scowl threw a shadow round about him although in spite of his sombre
influence their gayety continued to blaze higher like an ominous
comparison the flickering brilliancy of a lamp which has but a little
while to burn

eleven strokes full half an hour ago had pealed from the clock of the
old south when a rumor was circulated among the company that some new
spectacle or pageant was about to be exhibited which should put a
fitting close to the splendid festivities of the night

what new jest has your excellency in hand asked the reverend mather
byles whose presbyterian scruples had not kept him from the
entertainment trust me sir i have already laughed more than
beseems my cloth at your homeric confabulation with yonder ragamuffin
general of the rebels one other such fit of merriment and i must
throw off my clerical wig and band

not so good dr byles answered sir william howe if mirth were a
crime you had never gained your doctorate in divinity as to this new
foolery i know no more about it than yourself perhaps not so much
honestly now doctor have you not stirred up the sober brains of
some of your countrymen to enact a scene in our masquerade

perhaps slyly remarked the granddaughter of colonel joliffe whose
high spirit had been stung by many taunts against new england perhaps
we are to have a masque of allegorical figures victory with trophies
from lexington and bunker hill plenty with her overflowing horn to
typify the present abundance in this good town and glory with a
wreath for his excellency's brow

sir william howe smiled at words which he would have answered with one
of his darkest frowns had they been uttered by lips that wore a beard
he was spared the necessity of a retort by a singular interruption a
sound of music was heard without the house as if proceeding from a
full band of military instruments stationed in the street playing
not such a festal strain as was suited to the occasion but a slow
funeral-march the drums appeared to be muffled and the trumpets
poured forth a wailing breath which at once hushed the merriment of
the auditors filling all with wonder and some with apprehension the
idea occurred to many that either the funeral procession of some great
personage had halted in front of the province-house or that a corpse
in a velvet-covered and gorgeously-decorated coffin was about to be
borne from the portal after listening a moment sir william howe
called in a stern voice to the leader of the musicians who had
hitherto enlivened the entertainment with gay and lightsome melodies
the man was drum-major to one of the british regiments

dighton demanded the general what means this foolery bid your
band silence that dead march or by my word they shall have
sufficient cause for their lugubrious strains silence it sirrah

please your honor answered the drum-major whose rubicund visage
had lost all its color the fault is none of mine i and my band are
all here together and i question whether there be a man of us that
could play that march without book i never heard it but once before
and that was at the funeral of his late majesty king george ii

well well said sir william howe recovering his composure it is
the prelude to some masquerading antic let it pass

a figure now presented itself but among the many fantastic masks that
were dispersed through the apartments none could tell precisely from
whence it came it was a man in an old-fashioned dress of black serge
and having the aspect of a steward or principal domestic in the
household of a nobleman or great english landholder this figure
advanced to the outer door of the mansion and throwing both its
leaves wide open withdrew a little to one side and looked back toward
the grand staircase as if expecting some person to descend at the
same time the music in the street sounded a loud and doleful summons
the eyes of sir william howe and his guests being directed to the
staircase there appeared on the uppermost landing-place that was
discernible from the bottom several personages descending toward the
door the foremost was a man of stern visage wearing a
steeple-crowned hat and a skull-cap beneath it a dark cloak and huge
wrinkled boots that came halfway up his legs under his arm was a
rolled-up banner which seemed to be the banner of england but
strangely rent and torn he had a sword in his right hand and grasped
a bible in his left the next figure was of milder aspect yet full of
dignity wearing a broad ruff over which descended a beard a

# step 0: Collect Texts (aGoodMystery)

Forming a valid comparison group is critical. These texts are but a first attempt. We hope these will be 
augmented in subsequent analyses, perhaps your tests?

Over time, we collected 16 Poe short stories, as well as 16 texts  
from recommended American "contemporaries" of Poe (Cooper, Hawthorne, Irving, and Melville).
Knowing we needed more texts from the time period in question (ca. 1820-1840s), we collected 
20 stories published at this time by six other American, male authors. In all our 
experimental corpus is comprised of 52 texts from eleven authors, plus our contested story "A Dream".

###Notes: 

1. The file "UNKNOWN_ADream_1831.txt" contains the contested story. In some analysis, we change the prefix of this file to "Poe_" to facilitate its potential attribution (or not).

2. Not every one of these texts are used in every subsequent analyses (e.g., in the clustering phase,
we use at times only Poe stories; see Step_1_Clustering). For each step in the workflow, we have included the subset 
from the corpus directory that were used for that particular test. 

3. The texts stored here were all previously scrubbed using Lexos with the following options: 
make lowercase, remove digits, and remove punctuation (except keep internal-single hyphens and internal word apostrophes). As noted by Hoover (2015), various tools make slight but significant decisions when tokenizing. It is for precisely this reason that we start with a set of texts that have been consistently scrubbed.

4. The texts by Edgar's brother, Henry W. Poe, are included here but are themselves of contested authorship, thus we 
typically do *not* include these four stories in our tests.

###Thanks for help in corpus construction from:

Shirrel Rhoades, Editor of Absolutely Amazing Books
  Many Poe stories in text form were obtained from Shirrel Rhodes, publishing consultant, writer, book publisher and the colleague who first brought this question to our attention. 

Sam Coale, Wheaton College
  Sam tossed out names of "contemporaries" of Poe as a starting set of comparison authors. Most of these texts, e.g., by Hawthorne, Melville, et al. were obtained from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/).

Ted Underwood, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 
  Ted's blog entry "Open Data" (http://tedunderwood.com/open-data/) led to his sharing stories written in the 1820s and 1830s.

Ryan Cordell, Northeastern University
  Ryan answered an email plea with multiple suggestions.
1. Charles Brockden Brown is a bit too early, but is certainly a Gothic predecessor to Poe with many stylistic similarities.
2. Robert Montgomery Bird is an even more direct contemporary in both time and style. I'd include Sheppard Lee, but others from Bird as well.
3. You definitely want as much as you can find from George Lippard, a friend and correspondent of Poe's who wrote in the Gothic and city mystery traditions, mostly about Philadelphia. I'd start with The Quaker City.
4. If you could get a sampling of fiction from some of the magazines Poe edited and contributed to (Graham's,Southern Literary Messenger) that would be useful.

Cary Gouldin, Reference librarian, Wheaton College
  Cary led us to stories published in the magazines where Poe wrote (e.g., *North American Or Weekly Journal of Politics, Science and Literature*), including stories signed with the initials of Edgarâ€™s brother Henry (W.H.P.), many possibly written by Edgar himself (*cf.*, Collins 2013).

# step 0: Collect Texts (aGoodMystery)

Forming a valid comparison group is critical. These texts are but a first attempt. We hope these will be augmented in (your?) subsequent analyses.

Thanks for help in corpus construction from:

Shirrel Rhoades,  
Many Poe stories in text form were obtained from Shirrel Rhodes, publishing consultant, writer, book publisher and the colleague who first brought this question to our attention. 

Sam Coale, Wheaton College
Sam threw out names of "contemporaries" of Poe as a starting set of comparison authors. Most of these texts, e.g., by Hawthorne, Melville, et al. were obtained from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/).

Ted Underwood, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 
Ted's blog entry "Open Data" (http://tedunderwood.com/open-data/) led to his sharing stories written in the 1820s and 1830s.

Ryan Cordell, Northeastern University
Ryan answered an email plea with multiple suggestions.
1. Charles Brockden Brown is a bit too early, but is certainly a Gothic predecessor to Poe with many stylistic similarities.
2. Robert Montgomery Bird is an even more direct contemporary in both time and style. I'd include Sheppard Lee, but others from Bird as well.
3. You definitely want as much as you can find from George Lippard, a friend and correspondent of Poe's who wrote in the Gothic and city mystery traditions, mostly about Philadelphia. I'd start with The Quaker City.
4. If you could get a sampling of fiction from some of the magazines Poe edited and contributed to (Graham's,Southern Literary Messenger) that would be useful.

Cary Gouldin, Reference librarian, Wheaton College
Cary led us to stories published in the magazines where Poe wrote (e.g., North American Or Weekly Journal of Politics, Science and Literature), including stories signed with the initials of Edgarâ€™s brother Henry (W.H.P.), many possibly written by Edgar himself (cf. Collins 2013).
